 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 275: Inhuman (1)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It hasn’t even been six months… but they’re already done waiting…” Xu Yangyi mumbled to himself as he gently tapped the car window. After ages, he turned his head and said to Peony, “I have a minor matter that I have to make a trip for. I’ll definitely be back within a month.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You, investigate all the surroundings powers gathered in Longsu Province. No matter the size!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood.” Peony nodded at once and took out a small notebook to jot down a note—she didn’t have Xu Yangyi’s pill spirit-blessed eidetic memory. Shortly following, she said in doubt, “Commander… why this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All you have to worry about is getting it done.” Xu Yangyi laughed grimly and said, “Soon… you’ll see a few different things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peony agreed and left. Xu Yangyi didn’t return together with her to Mingshui Province but instead brought Li Zongyuan with him to drive to Xiang Province’s airport.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master….” On the airplane, Li Zongyuan muttered as he gazed attentively at Xu Yangyi who was continuously exercising his five fingers. His master was taking joy in the feeling of regaining something that was once lost. He said respectfully, “Is your hand… okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his contemplations, Xu Yangyi regained his wits, and his gaze shifted outside the airplane window, and he said dimly, “It’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then…” Li Zongyuan coughed dryly, “you’re not going to Longsu Province to take care of the situation? An A-rank legion’s organizational breakaway i-is a strike on Master’s honor…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi didn’t respond. There were some words that he couldn’t say to Peony, but he could speak his mind to Li Zongyuan who had handed over his life to him. “How many A-rank legions does Longsu Province have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two.” Li Zongyuan answered, “Black Armor and Heavenly Opening. Both their commanders are initial-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, and they both have over forty-somewhat legionnaires. Among them, at least half are Foundation Establishment Seniors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And what about the Heavenly Opening?” <span id="footnote-ref-1f4f"><a href="#footnote-1f4f">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s still no news about Heavenly Opening,” Li Zongyuan recalled, “Now that Longsu Province is completely sealed, there’s no entry or exit allowed. They have to switch over to telephone communication.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A grim smile curved at the crook of Xu Yangyi’s mouth. He still hadn’t been officially appointed, but there were already some lineages starting operations to attack him. Perhaps he didn’t have much of a heated intention to capture the heavenly paradise before the Ketu-Rahu Sword had been forged, but now, through the chance ignition of that fire seed, he knew that he had to bring a slice of the heavenly paradise into his pocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No worries,” he said as his gaze twinkled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Good… consider me the softest persimmon… While I really do look like that from the outside, there’s no way that now is the final moment as to whom the deer falls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then are we still not recruiting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi shook his head. It wasn’t that he was unable to, but he couldn’t recruit now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great shock was on the verge of unfolding in Longsu Province, to the extent that it influenced the cultivation world’s structure. The major and minor clans were bound to have already revealed a few things to those with the ambition to reign supreme. If he recruited now, who knew whether or not he would be stabbed in the back when the time came? Even if this didn’t happen, would seven or eight among the ten recruited run away before the dawn of battle?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze turned beyond the window. The airplane was already starting to descend. Presently, he had to first know whether Xiaoqing and Fahai had left behind contingencies. If there was, he would be able to withstand the impact of every power with this confidence. If there wasn’t, he would have to plan otherwise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tianzi Mountain was a hundred kilometers away from Xiang Province’s capital. Xu Yangyi didn’t stop for a moment and immediately contracted a car, rushing towards Tianzi Mountain’s Wuling National Scenery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a large nationally renowned scenic area, there was an endless flow of countless passenger transports, coaches buses, and private cars on the road. After several hours, he and Li Zongyuan couldn’t help but sigh wistfully concerning how many people were in China.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Friends of the Everday Tour Group, please assemble here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone from the Supreme Tour Group, gather round!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Friends, this is Tianzi Mountain, a famous scenery in China with a long history. It’s named ‘Tianzi’ because in ancient times, the leader of the Tujia people, Xiang Dakun, commanded a local peasant revolt…” <span id="footnote-ref-0b0f"><a href="#footnote-0b0f">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the side of Tianzi Mountain’s scenic area is Xiang Province’s famous Zhangjiajie landscape…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All kinds of voices echoed amidst loudspeakers. People coming and going looked at Li Zongyuan at Xu Yangyi like they were idiots because no one traveling would wear a suit. Furthermore both of them were dressed up on this occasion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi furrowed his brows imperceptibly. Through long periods of secluded and bitter cultivation, he no longer enjoyed venues with too many people, especially a place like this which could be said to be now jam-packed with people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took out an item and handed it over to Li Zongyuan. “Give this to the person in charge here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any cultivator had a record on file with the Chinese government, and through the evaluation and reflection of one’s strength, they would receive different qualifications. However, these corresponding qualifications were their “Special Forces Identification”, or abbreviated to just SF. With this identification in possession, a majority of all of China’s regions had special channels dedicated to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And yet, this identification wasn’t a privilege that any cultivator could hold. The identification in Xu Yangyi’s hand had been issued to him after Ancestor Ancientpine decided to make him a Featherwood Guard branch master. Otherwise, if every person had this identification—all of China’s million Qi Condensation cultivators—things would’ve been a mess early on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bored senseless, Xu Yangyi found a place and took out a cigarette. At the door, there were a great many people. Places to sit had been filled up long ago. Tour group members walked back and forth in his surroundings. There were old men holding cups of warm tea and women loudly shouting with their relatives. There were also group members inadvertently swaying little red flags.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the entrance of the scenic area, there was a team of military police standing. Li Zongyuan’s objective was there. Xu Yangyi glanced and pulled his gaze back, yet at this moment he felt a sliver of murderous aura sharply flare beside him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sudden! Too sudden! And extremely concealed! He simply hadn’t felt any sign. Like so, this murderous aura suddenly arrived at his side and instantly locked onto him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of reflex, his body faintly stirred, but Xu Yangyi was quick to restrain his movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An enemy in the darkness and himself in the light… His gaze motionlessly swept over everyone present. The foe was hidden among many people, and this venue really wasn’t a good place to act. Perhaps the other party wanted to use this area to confine him, but in the final moment where the map was left behind and the dagger was in sight, this enemy was no longer able to control his murderous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This represented… that the other was pretty much already sidled up next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So eager?” Xu Yangyi took a light drag of his cigarette, and a shred of killing intent surfaced in his heart. Regardless of who it was, if this enemy truly believed that he didn’t risk acting in front of so many people, then they were gravely mistaken!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the other side, Li Zongyuan had already made contact with the military police unit. Evidently, they were very surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, someone just happened to walk over to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, there was an old man in front of Xu Yangyi, so old that he almost couldn’t open his eyes. His hands shaking, he gripped a thermos while supported on a walking stick, yet he wasn’t inconvenienced at all. Yet through what appeared to be a careless accident, a person behind knocked into the old man even more carelessly. Following a startled cry, the thermos that the old man had just twisted open flew out from his grip and towards Xu Yangyi’s hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the cup, there was dark-green tea that cast a sparkling radiance beneath sunlight. Xu Yangyi’s pupils suddenly needled… because he clearly saw that this wasn’t tea!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It see,ed to be identical to tea, but in fact… it wasn’t. He remembered a lesson from Heavens Law that this was an item called Daybreak Dew. The name was pleasant to the ear, but in truth, such an item… Once it touched one’s body, it would immediately invade a cultivator’s protective qi! Under Foundation Establishment, it almost couldn<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">’</span>t be defended against! Moreover, it would continue to corrode a person’s skin, flesh, and blood until the extremely volatile Daybreak Dew was practically exhausted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the old man yelped out in surprise, and his doddering body followed the falling cup and fell down towards Xu Yangyi, astonishment covering his face. As fate would have it, his walking stick was aimed right at Xu Yangyi’s dantian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember I said…” Xu Yangyi still hadn’t moved and said dimly, “if you want to come, you better send a decent assassin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Xingtian Legion has an assassin, and he is much more professional than you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice yet to fall, the cigarette butt in his hand had already been gently flicked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In the wake of a heavy groan, the tiny cigarette butt immediately made the sound of a blunt object hitting the human body! In the wake of a loud crack, the old man’s neck was actually snapped by this cigarette butt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man’s head oddly faced back at a ninety degree angle, yet there wasn’t a hint of change on his face. Nonetheless, he charged Xu Yangyi with the same complete speed! The end of his walking stick was already starting to twinkle with blue spiritual light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Xu Yangyi didn’t relax by a hair. Instead, he focused his gaze on the old man. An extreme feeling of danger followed as the blue dot of light in the old man’s cane progressively smoldered, swiftly pervading his mind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, an incredulous idea surfaced in his mind. He understood… He understood what this old man wanted to do! Perhaps it was better to say that this wasn’t an old man but rather…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A machine puppet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A suicide bombing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to kill him or force out his killing move, that pair of greedy eyes in the darkness went so far as to make the choice to bomb a place with so many people! Regardless of whether or not there were mortals present!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly paradise, this word had already driven some clans to frenzy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“GET OUT THE WAY!!!” In the crowd, Xu Yangyi exploded with a roar. Prompt to react, all the mortals were dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They saw… a person, the man who didn’t fit in with his suit. All of a sudden, a mechanical wing grew out from his back, and he flew into the air with a gust of wind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dang…” Astonished, a young man looked at Xu Yangyi, who was over thirty meters high up in the sky, and wiped his eyes. “A-Am I seeing this right? I-Is this even human?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Superman? Batman?” A youth took out his cell phone and snagged a picture with all of his effort. “Damn! This is basically Superman! A real Superman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is this demon?” A woman looked at sky, not daring to believe her eyes. “China… has their own S.H.I.E.L.D too?” <span id="footnote-ref-058d"><a href="#footnote-058d">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tourists and civilians didn’t sense… the terrible qi amassing at the center of them! Once this accumulation reached its ends in five seconds, no man, woman, or child would be left alive in a hundred-meter radius!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was deranged!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Zongyuan heard Xu Yangyi’s voice and immediately sensed the mass of extremely unstable qi. His pupils suddenly constricted, and he screamed, “GET DOWN!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides him, the military captain was checking his identification. Although the captain didn’t know why, he dropped down on his stomach upon hearing this shout, as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At almost the same time, an orange orb of light detonated in the crowd!</span></p>
