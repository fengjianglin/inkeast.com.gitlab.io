 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi stood up, pushed the door open, and walked out of the office. Chief Zheng immediately chased after him and asked, “Young Xu… Young Xu! The case! How should it be handled?! W-Why did they find me? I d-didn’t hear about this kind of precedent w-when I took up office!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, above all else, he didn’t want Xu Yangyi to depart. As he recalled what happened a little while ago, his heart grew weary with trepidation. An invisible reaper had cut across thousands of meters… and charged through the bulletproof glass from some place in the city, turning everything into rubble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi narrowed his eyes, not answering the panicked chief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Lighthouse Effect… and it was unknown whether this demon had become bloated on its self-confidence or gone insane. It had actually dared to attack him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lighthouse illuminated people, and people could see it, as well. The moment he’d arrived at City Hall, he and the demon had become each other's lighthouse. After two days, the beast finally couldn’t bear it any longer and made the first move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll be taking over. No one else is allowed to get involved.” His steps were nimble and firm as he walked ahead. He didn’t give a reply. On the contrary, his manner of speech left no room for questions. Chief Zheng followed behind him, his appearance completely unlike a superior in relation to his subordinate. Instead, the bureau chief was listening respectfully and bobbing his head up and down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi abruptly stopped in stride and looked at Chief Zheng deeply. “That includes you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure!” Chief Zheng immediately responded, and his heart settled for the most part. In order to suppress these&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">things</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, how much effort had the government dispensed? The money and energy expended was simply an astronomical figure! Behind every news story when the masses asked “why”... there were far too many hidden secrets that could not be spoken of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Second, organize a fire squad that you feel is absolutely reliable. In three days, I’ll start prepping for operations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not a problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third, concerning the personnel authorizations of those dispatched to this case, no one else is allowed to interfere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Chief Zheng muttered to himself in hesitation. In regards to this major case, this was the same as skinning him of all of his power as the Public Security Bureau’s first-in-command. Furthermore, it was evident that Xu Yangyi was telling him that he wanted to strip him of his privileges and also wanted him to make a promise from his own mouth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there a problem?” Xu Yangyi turned his head and looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No… No problems!” Chief Zheng’s voice fluttered softly, yet his heart grew cold. Gritting his teeth, he immediately responded, “This case… I won’t lay a hand on it! The police and the military police are yours to command! If you still need the army… I’ll arrange it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it wasn’t necessary, he was completely unwilling to personally broaden his knowledge of the M-Files’ contents, and what the truth of the matter was really like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was quiet. The only sound that remained was the clap of Chief Zheng’s leather shoes pounding the floor. Throughout the whole journey, no words were exchanged. As the pair arrived at the Public Security Bureau’s entrance, Xu Yangyi raised his brows and said with reservation, “Chief Zheng, is there something else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng had continued to follow behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“N-Nothing at all!” Chief Zheng blushed. From the bottom of his heart, he’d believed this mysterious young man to still have some other request. What was up with Xu Yangyi? Didn’t he know how to speak when nothing else was happening?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi nodded. “Then, I’ll step out first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, a voice suddenly echoed out from behind them. “Chief Zheng, wait a moment! Hold on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Vice Captain Chen trod over to them, Xu Yangyi furrowed his brows and made to leave. Nonetheless, Vice Captain Chen had already yelled out, “Captain Xu, I’ll have to trouble you to wait, too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Chen.” Facing Vice Captain Chen, Chief Zheng was finally relieved of much tension. As he talked with Xu Yangyi just now, he’d unwittingly assumed a subservient position, without regard that Xu Yangyi was in his early twenties. Based on age, Xu Yangyi should’ve still been a youth studying at university.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That kind of pressure, a formless one, made him feel incredibly oppressed. Only now did he recovered his prestige as the chief of city security.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did something happen?” He coolly swept over Xu Yangyi from the corner of his eye and promptly added, “If anything occurs, you can inform Captain Xu first, since you’ll be reporting to him. It’ll be fine as long as you coordinate with him with to the best of your ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Captain Chen paused upon hearing these words. He nearly choked on his spit! Was this a fucking joke?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You’re forcing a seasoned veteran like me to accompany this paratrooper!? This is a follow-up on a serial-killer case! Accompany your goddamn ass!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why did he have to babysit Xu Yangyi? How was he supposed to accompany him? This pudgy-faced brat that had never seen a crime scene? Didn’t this place the entire unit under Xu Yangyi’s command?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chief Zheng, this is about the case!” In violent fury, it was easy for a man to lose his rationality. With burning rage attacking his heart, Vice Captain Chen simply didn’t look at Xu Yangyi. He hadn’t even seen the meaningful look within Chief Zheng’s eyes. He gritted his teeth and said, “Aren’t I considered a senior of the police department? Old Zheng! You and I graduated from the academy at the same time! How is this case going to be handled? Who’s responsible for it? Can’t you just tell me what the heck is going on?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Captain Chen had looked on as the captain’s position failed to land within his grasp. He didn’t have Chief Zheng’s methods, but they were the same age. He had endured until his hair had grown white, only to see the dawn of a new captain. Yet before even waiting for him to fall into fantasy, this dream was suddenly killed off by a paratrooper’s descent! How could he not be angry? How could he not be furious? Anyone in the Disciplinary and Investigations Unit could tolerate this tone, but he wouldn’t put up with it anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Xu Yangyi’s mouth slightly curled up. Rather than say these words for Chief Zheng to hear, it was better to make a deliberate display of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You want to come down, take credit and look good, fine, no problems. But you can’t make me do something without just cause, right? How are the merits going to be divided, huh? Your credit-stealing ass waltzed right in now, and I wasn’t the one to get your position! You stacheless brat, what do you know about handling a case? I’ll let you supervise, and you’ll see a living ghost when you find the killer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The major serial-killer case… I heard there’s a lot of importance attached to it within the province, but with this opportunity, you, an emotionless paratrooper, get dropped down to carve up our flesh piece by piece?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng’s brows suddenly tightened. What madness! What foolish nonsense! The city had been the one to invite someone from Heavens Law! Nonetheless, Vice Captain Chen didn’t tighten his trap and was instead stirring up a ruckus! Wasn’t it enough of a mess already to resent Xu Yangyi?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These lines were like several staggering blows, leaving Chief Zheng’s head spinning. Meaningfully pulling on Vice Captain Chen’s hand, he laughed awkwardly, “Old Chen… we’re old friends. Food may be eaten indiscriminately, but words cannot be said carelessly…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fuck!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Captain Chen nearly cursed. His temperament was fiery to begin with, so upon hearing these words he clenched his teeth angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s the problem today? What damned sickness did you catch?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng, who he’d known well for many years, had delivered some strange words to him! Was this to remind him… of Xu Yangyi’s great background?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who was that bastard son of a bitch?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, a beautiful misunderstanding had come about. Chief Zheng simply didn’t dare to speak of this matter. This two-bit idiot Vice Captain Chen only knew that his expected position was out of his grasp and now he even had to obey a brat’s commands?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Captain Chen stewed in his thoughts. Not even mentioning what the outcome would be like, Chief Zheng had used these words to warn him! How was this something that he, as a senior in the department for decades, was able to continue enduring?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Zheng, what do you mean?” Choking on anger, Vice Captain Chen glared at the other, grinded down on his teeth, and said, “What? Even after so many years, you still don’t trust me? Two years ago, who handled the bank robbery? And then that last one from back then, who arrested those two killers on the run? Why? You’re letting that paratrooper be in charge? You kidding me?! He’s going to handle the case?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t stand for it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t expected that before he even finished speaking, the indifferent sound of Xu Yangyi’s laughter would flutter pass. Xu Yangyi seemed to be as relaxed as if he’d just finished his afternoon tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words angered Vice Captain Chen so much that his eyes turned somewhat white.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I won’t… You should just fucking go!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t do it!” Vice Captain Chen took a deep breath. “Chief Zheng! I apologize, I was a bit worried, but the entire province is following this case! Do you believe in him, or do you believe in me?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng’s face hung low. In his heart, he’d already cursed the vice captain to death! He believed in Vice Captain Chen’s case-handling abilities, however, could Vice Captain Chen handle this case? Would his old friend dare to? For him to let Vice Captain Chen handle this case would be equal to harming him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This case… Hehe, I really still can’t believe in you!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng thought to himself</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This couldn’t be said…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had zero desire to imagine what the consequences would be like if every city’s M-Files and all the people involved were exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chief Zheng, you have to say something!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Say something? Sure.” Chief Zheng let out laughter as cold as ice.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fine, if you can’t read between the lines, then it serves you right that someone airdropped you!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Soon after, he looked at Vice Captain Chen and said loud and clear, enunciating every word, “I. Shall. Say. It. Once. More.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain Xu has full responsibility over this major case! Old Chen, you should do according to what he says! Otherwise, don’t blame me despite the many years of friendship between us!” He finished speaking and brushed his sleeve aside, taking his leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Captain Chen was left in a total daze. It was fully out of his expectations that Chief Zheng would be so uncaring of the present situation! Moreover, he didn’t think the man would directly denounce him! Was this really his old acquaintance Chief Zheng?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good… Good!” Vice Captain Chen glared at Chief Zheng’s back for a brief moment, turning his head and leaving. “Who gives a fuck! I won’t do it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng simply didn’t pay attention to his threat and swaggered away without a second thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Captain Chen smiled meaningfully at Xu Yangyi at his side, using his eyes as blades as if he could deliver Xu Yangyi a death of a thousand cuts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the other didn’t speak… the presence behind him had surprisingly forced the chief of the Public Security Bureau to speak on his behalf! The higher-ups were making him listen to this brat’s commands?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was this the Central Committee’s three generations of officials?

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve worked at the Public Security Bureau for dozens of years, but I have to obey the commands of this recent graduate who doesn’t even a single hair on his upper lip?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mumbling and so on, the vice captain brushed past Xu Yangyi and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crook of Xu Yangyi’s mouth faintly perked up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t think he hadn’t heard Vice Captain Chen’s words clearly…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi made his way to the parking lot. He unhurriedly sat down in his Audi and suddenly laughed. “That’s right, I don’t understand how to handle a case…” He popped open a drink and smiled in satisfaction. “However… my fist is good enough…” Smoke puffed through the roof of the car, and the vapors wound his eyes shut. “It looks like I’ll have to question some of the ‘locals’... I hope they’ll cooperate…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his eyes, the world’s balance in comparison to ordinary people was far more than just money.

  <p>1. This passage is pretty unique that the author does some of it in english. Unfortunately, while he does get some of it right, it looks like nonsense, so I had to fix it. Trying to actually find lyrics for these three forbidden songs on western internet is actually impossible apparently, since I can’t find it, but luckily, our Chinese counterparts have preserved it well on their internet. If you can read Chinese, look up 世界三大禁曲 on Baidu. On western internet, at best, you’ll be able to find out the names of these songs and perhaps a clip on youtube. <a href="#footnote-ref-92e8"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>
