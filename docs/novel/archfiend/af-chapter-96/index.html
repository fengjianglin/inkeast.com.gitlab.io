The seven stars of the Big Dipper, their starry edges had converged into a simple long blade. There existed no adornment whatsoever. It was simple yet rough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the killing aura congealed on the body of this long blade… caused all vegetation in the volcanic lake to wither and die in an instant, an air that brought all living things to servitude.&nbsp;</span></p>

The blade carried a brilliant heavenly might. Under this blade chop, the plants on the ground shriveled in the wake of each place it neared. Afterwards, like a drop of blackness piercing the water surface, it swiftly extended over the entire Old Black Mountain from the beginning of the volcanic lake’s surroundings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blade, the opposition of all things in life or death. The blade appeared not to be fast, but in the last second it emerged, it had already ruthlessly slashed towards the thousand-meter protective shield in the next second!</span></p>

Each movement in the outside world affected his heart.</span></p>

Mountains collapsed and oceans seethed! So long as a cultivator followed the Dao with heart and soul, who wouldn’t be in great admiration because of this scene?</span></p>

The sky was the same as always. It appeared as if nothing had occurred, however, the mists over the lake had completely dispersed, the pond brimming with bloody redness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A body, so enormously terrifying, reclined in the pool. It was like a crocodile, its lower and upper jaws were of equal length. The inside of its mouth was teeming with sharp teeth that were a few meters long. It didn’t possess four limbs; its four limbs were four fin-like appendages. Its entire body was covered with bluish-black scales. A fish-like tail. Merely...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its head wasn’t on its body! Rather… the head and body were rendered into two separate parts! The large eyes of its skull bulged wide, unclosed even in death and bearing grievances. It caused the lake to brim with blood as it slowly fell down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could speak. Xu Yangyi tightly clenched his fists, stifling the shock of his heart. The breathing of God Ming and the three old men was rushed, their faces flushed red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment the hare had reared its head, the falcon had swooped down for the hunt! In the blink of an eye... Daomaster Jadewave’s unexpected corpse was in the lake!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…” After several minutes, Xu Yangyi settled his mind and said heavily, “a Mosasaurus?” <span id="footnote-ref-e7bb"><a href="#footnote-e7bb">[1]</a></span></span></p>

The Mosasaurus that’s been extinct for several million years? A thousand years ago, this lost species still truly existed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;was a true strange species of ancient times! Yet such a lost ancient species had been slain by the falling of the heavens’ seven-star blade! A thousand-year Dao foundation, a dynasty’s complete destruction!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no one present that could speak. The distance was unknown and the location was a mystery, but separated by myriad mountains and vast waters, this delivered blow… Someone had beheaded this millennium-old Mosasaurus like so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Daomaster Jadewave’s resistance had become a move worthy of ridicule. The demon couldn’t even say a word as it had been beheaded under that blade! The event had lasted no longer than a twinkling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of divine ability was this?! What was its realm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Xu Yangyi simply didn’t ponder it and rushed towards the volcanic lake with full power, layered with both Life Sacrification and Flying Star! At nearly the same time, God Ming’s gaze continuously flickered. In the next second, his speed increased explosively, charging towards the volcanic lake like a streaking meteor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, the two of them had raised their speeds to the pinnacle! At the same time, there was only the sight of the other in each of their eyes, bearing a fierce battle intent not concealed in the slightest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An entire demon form that had reached the Core Formation level, the skin, flesh, blood, special parts, and so on were all treasures! However, the most important was the demon core! This was the demon core of a Core Formation demon that had just died! The origin crystal of a lost ancient species! This… was its second life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this demon core was carried on the body, the worry of qi exhaustion would cease to be. It could be well imagined that if both sides were lanterns burning down to their final flames and one side activated the infinite energy mechanism that was the Core Formation demon core, how would this battle method even be combated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To possess such an item… even late-stage Foundation Establishment to the limit of the Great Circle would be provoked to some consideration! Granted that it couldn’t be absorbed, the demon core could still be detonated. The explosion of a Core Formation demon core was explanatory in its terror!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">None would permit it and none could allow it! In an instant, the atmosphere arrived at a burning-white intensity!</span></p>

In an instant, it extended over a hundred meters like a spider spitting out silk. His eyes bloodshot, he swiftly shot forth and brought with him a strong gale!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the wake of his angered howl, his twenty-plus puppets that had been rendered immobile by the deceased Daomaster Jadewave rattled again with a crack. In several seconds, seemingly pulled on by a thread, they arced towards Xu Yangyi like electricity!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mongrel!” God Ming was on the edge of his toes; what arcane effort did this lowly cur cultivate? His speed was actually THIS fast?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the layered combo of Life Sacrification and Flying Star, Xu Yangyi’s speed wasn’t a bit slower in comparison to God Ming’s! The target was likewise evident—the heart within Jadewave’s body, the location of the demon core!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoever had killed Jadewave or why they had beheaded the demon was currently unimportant. What was important was this great opportunity; no one was willing to relinquish it!</span></p>

As the tremendous qi flower completely exploded at the Four Great Joint Pools, a cracking noise rang out from the suspended coffin, and a pale hand like that of a corpse lifted the cover. Dazed, an emaciated old man donned in the clothes of a Qing dynasty official sat up in shock and looked towards the direction of the Four Great Joint Pools. <span id="footnote-ref-afd6"><a href="#footnote-afd6">[2]</a></span></span></p>

  <p>1. I almost mistranslated this. Fun fact: Mosasaurus in Chinese is literally Azure Dragon. If you want a better visualization of a mosasaurus, look up the one from the movie “Jurassic World”.

  <p>2. 悬棺 - hanging/suspended coffin. Copy paste this word and look at images. This is what I believe the situation of the coffin might actually be, versus hanging in midair. <a href="#footnote-ref-afd6"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>3. You may have noticed that I have been continually calling Jadewave “it”. Author calls Jadewave “it”, but actually refers to Jadewave with the masculine “him” in some narration.

  <p>4. In the story, nearly every mention of Beijing is actually more along the lines of “Beijing seat of government”, which is referring to the central governing building in Beijing, but it's a mouthful to say that it. I figure just shortening it most of the time is along the lines of saying “Back at Washington/Paris/Berlin” and is implicit in meaning. This time, the scene is actually in the governing seat building. <a href="#footnote-ref-633b"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
