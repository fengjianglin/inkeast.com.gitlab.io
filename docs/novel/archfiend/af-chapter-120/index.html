 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 120: Forming the Pill (3)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pill spirit with the same cultivation as the Ancestral Daofather Zhang Daoling! He was not a true immortal but was still a half-immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What in the world is this creature? Where did it come from?” Pondering for ages, Xu Yangyi decided not to care. Only when he concocted pills in the future would he have to find someone for protective magiks. The only thing he was sure of was that a pill spirit’s cultivation wouldn’t surmount the alchemist’s cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for protective magiks, what problem did they pose? He risked betting that as soon as he sounded out a few matters later on, he only had to open his mouth and many people would be willing to cast them for him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Settling his mind, Xu Yangyi began to comprehend his gains from the pill spirit. The effect… couldn’t be considered ordinary, but it also wasn’t outrageous, either. It was to never forget with a passing of the eyes, an eidetic memory! No matter the number of times he looked at something, starting from now, he would no longer forget with a single glance. Regardless of how many times something was said, he only needed to remember and it would be absolutely recalled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the special effect carried by the pill spirit of moments ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s like a lottery, huh.” Xu Yangyi laughed and looked towards the medicinal pill in his hand. Black and round as a ball, the three-mark Minister pill was like a fire as it laid quietly in his hand. For Qi Condensation cultivators, the Spirit Strengthening Pill didn’t offer too great of a restriction in advancement. It was Foundation Establishment that was a difficult single-log bridge that all men struggled to cross. However, even so, there were also many people before a minor boundary who couldn’t cross the opposing bodily limiter. The Spirit Strengthening Pill reinforced their spiritual sense to smash the crux of the bodily limiter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, he had no use for this medicinal pill. Right now, his qi was approximately around 30% of the middle-stage Qi Condensation realm. The distance from his next advancement was still at least seven to eight years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silent for a brief moment, he called out in his spiritual sense,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Zongyuan, Mao Ba’er, come in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Less than ten minutes later, Mao Ba’er and Li Zongyuan walked in, mean-mugging each other. Just as he entered, Mao Ba’er shouted oddly, “My sweet ancestor!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Soundsink stone had been chaotically swept everywhere in the cultivation room. There was also a tremendous scar with a ten meter radius on the wall! As for the high-grade Spirit Focusing Formation… it had long since been interrupted on the wall it was carved on. Repairing it would be a hefty expense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Honey! Can’t you think about me when you’re wrecking things?! Do you want me to bend over and wear myself out for you until my dying day?!” Mao Ba’er slapped Xu Yangyi’s chest with his paw, his tone proper and his words stern, “What the hell are you doing?! You say you’re gonna do something, so you’re just gonna do it?! Were you banging on the wall for fun?! Tell me, which shameless wench was it that seduced you?! This Dao Master will go waste him straightaway!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao Master?” Li Zongyuan disdained, “Are you dreaming?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if I’m not one now, I’ll certainly be a Dao Master later on!” Mao Ba’er coldly snorted, “Who’s like you? An emotionless peon without aspiration or pursuit. Who gave you the courage to speak with This Dao Master? To stand at my side to only act as my foil is your supreme glory, yet you still don’t fall back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the struggle of tongues, Li Zongyuan evidently wasn’t the vulgar dog’s opponent. After rolling his eyes, he walked in front of Xu Yangyi, yet just as he was about to open his mouth, a paw obstructed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You actually dare to strive for favor with This Palace… Huan Huan, you are becoming more and more unsightly in speech.” <span id="footnote-ref-b82d"><a href="#footnote-b82d">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who?! Who’s Huan Huan?!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Li Zongyuan fumed in burning rage and clenched his pearly teeth so hard that they seemed to crack. Nonetheless… he truly had come to fight for favor…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Xu Yangyi’s mood was already settled, and he laughed, “Mao Ba’er, what realm are you at right now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The initial stage of Qi Condensation.” Mao Ba’er rolled his eyes at Xu Yangyi. “Not caring about anyone else without even the tiniest considerate, where did that cute little kid from the past go?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi listened as if he hadn’t heard Mao Ba’er and nodded. He then looked at Li Zongyuan. “And you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Congratulations on leaving seclusion, Master.” Li Zongyuan didn’t care for the setting and bowed. “I have already reached the bottleneck of the initial stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi oh’d in understanding. After Li Zongyuan had evolved, what breed he was likewise couldn’t be figured out. Only the space inside his stomach had increased by a fold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take this.” Xu Yangyi stretched his hand and flicked. A black object flew out. “Eat this here, and you’ll immediately break through to the middle stage afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Li Zongyuan received it customarily and brushed an eye over it. He bowed habitually and laughed, “Many thanks, Mas…” His words were left unfinished.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No way, that can’t be right!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This recently gained object was a bit familiar to the eye! He seemed to have witnessed it many times in video recordings, educational films, and other assorted materials on the internet regarding ancient cultivation! The second half of the title leaving his mouth was left unsaid. Li Zongyuan seemed to have been struck by a paralysis technique. His head was cracking like a machine, and he twisted the top of his hand, only glancing, but no longer able to move his gaze away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This shape… This spiritual force fluctuation… This medicinal aroma… Don’t tell me… Could it be…? I-Impossible… Master has to be playing a joke on me. Oh, that’s right, he said he was pill concocting. This definitely isn’t the refined pill… Is this a jelly bean? An M&amp;M? That’s has to be it, hehehe… I’m really smart, there’s no way I’m wrong...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But… that’s also wrong… How could an M&amp;M give off a medicinal aroma? If it’s not chocolate...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“M-M-M-Master…” As Li Zongyuan raised his head, his complexion was already deathly white. His hands were madly trembling, and he couldn’t even string together words. He only looked at Xu Yangyi, dumb as a wooden chicken. He wondered whether his tongue had been tied into a knot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly, Mao Ba’er said nothing as well. Instead, he looked at the middle of Li Zongyuan’s hand in shock, and then at Xu Yangyi, and then at the black object again, and then at Xu Yangyi once more… An infinite loop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is… T-This is, this is a p-p-pill…” Li Zongyuan’s face flushed red and white. Tremendous happiness smashed his thoughts into fine mush, like a meteor, but he didn’t risk being too excited because he was afraid once excitement went over his head, the despair would be so great he wouldn’t be able to bear it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just refined it. It just happens that you can use the Spirit Strengthening Pill to break through.” Xu Yangyi laughed, paying no mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eat this pill. I don’t even need a week to pop out another one. What’s the big deal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The beginning of anything was difficult. It could even be said that Xu Yangyi had restored the Eternal Alchemy Canon step by step, all by himself. All procedures and essentials were in his brain. All parts of it were damaged, so didn’t it basically have to be said that he recreated the ancient text for a second time? <span id="footnote-ref-c33e"><a href="#footnote-c33e">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit Strengthening pill! These three words were sketched in light shades, de-emphasized, yet they were heavy!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“T-This is r-really a p-pill?” Li Zongyuan finally spoke what seemed to be a complete sentence. He just hadn’t detected that his eyes were bloodshot as he stammered these words out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not pill elixir?!” Mao Ba’er no longer had the mind to be crass and lowly, and immediately barked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think…” Xu Yangyi comfortably stretched out. “You’ll need a sip of water to take it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“MASTER!!!” To Xu Yangyi’s surprise, in the next second Li Zongyuan promptly kneeled, his head touching the floor. “I-I’m ready to give my life and everything for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no need to choose. Essentially no need for hesitation. The Dao of Pills… had appeared in the world! It had truly surfaced in the world! Moreover, it was grasped in his hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Zongyuan understood… He knew everything. Back then, Xu Yangyi had indeed been concocting pills with the medicinal ingredients he’d bought! Furthermore, it wasn’t pill elixirs, but genuine pills! The Dao of Pills!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The future days of a demon familiar living at a pill master’s side truly would be generous! In this instant, Li Zongyuan had been thoroughly converted in heart. He dared not hold an inkling of a minor, devious thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spud!” Mao Ba’er’s eyes were erupting with fire. “It really is a pill! You were really messing around with Pill Dao?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course.” Xu Yangyi laughed, “Later on, there’ll be many places where I’ll have to use cash. You can order dessert.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Use your goddamn %@$#!!!” After Mao Ba’er obtained confirmation again, he shortly began to jump around and shriek. “Fuck me! Fuck me!!! This really fucking is the most fantastic story of the century!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Dao of Pills! Pill Dao! The fucking Dao of Pills! Lost for almost 200 years! Two centuries! You were actually did it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s cash? Hot damn! Me order dessert?! I’ll order a damn dessert! As long as you fucking open your mouth, the cash is going to pour straight into your pocket!!!” Mao Ba’er swiftly fell into incoherent rambling, his mouth filled with crude words. However, this indicated how abnormally excited he already was! <span id="footnote-ref-9aac"><a href="#footnote-9aac">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master! In this entire world, you alone possess this item! You alone!” Li Zongyuan stood up as well. Because of excessive shock and excitement, his voice was crowing. “Sir, whatever price you state is the price that’ll be! I dare to bet you’ll certainly become a real big shot! An apex cultivator!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Specific operations can be put off until later.” Xu Yangyi waved. “Are you still not going to take it? This is the first medicinal pill in 200 years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Y-Yes! YES!!!” Li Zongyuan shakily took the medicinal pill. His gaze obsessed, even as he placed it at his mouth, he was so slow that he didn’t risk swallowing it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Xu Yangyi furrowed his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master...” Li Zongyuan’s chest rapidly heaved up and down. “T-This item is too precious. I-I-I can’t part with it… You! What the heck are you doing?! I’m not done with you! WIND EDGE TECHNIQUE!!!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A half-meter-long wind edge—evidently, Li Zongyuan had used all of his power in an instant—wildly shot towards a swiftly fleeing husky who was standing up like a human and cupping a medicinal pill in his two paws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let GO!!!” Li Zongyuan’s eyes flushed red, threatening to split wide. The toad-demon’s voice was so loud that even Xu Yangyi picked at his ear in agitation. However, the Li Zongyuan of this very moment couldn’t take it anymore and charged Mao Ba’er like he was insane. Taking advantage of his inattention just now, this lowly dog had robbed the medicinal pill and ran off without even saying a word!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mao Ba’er kept quiet and scurried towards the entrance at lightning speed. From what could be seen of the speed of his wagging tail, his present mood was very cheerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in any case, Li Zongyuan was of heart to kill Mao Ba’er! This was a medicinal pill! Not a pill elixir! The Dao of Pills that had been born into the world after two centuries once more! The first medicinal pill! It was also suited to his own boundary! A pill that his master even bestowed upon him! It had actually been robbed from under his eyelids by this stupid dog!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gurk!” A tongue suddenly flew out from his mouth and launched swiftly at Mao Ba’er. The husky-demon heard the sound of the wind and skipped in fright. “Are you fucking playin’ for real?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No shit!” Li Zongyuan clenched his teeth so hard that they seemed to crack. “Give it back!!! Otherwise, I won’t rest until your dead!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough.” In the end, Xu Yangyi opened his mouth, and Mao Ba’er froze. Li Zongyuan’s expression struggled terribly, yet he also came to a halt. He was debating whether or not to truly kill this dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give it to him.” Xu Yangyi knitted his brows. “Anyways, its not like you won’t get one later. What are you in a rush for? You’re not even at a bottleneck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can you be so calm?!” As soon as Mao Ba’er heard this, his hair stood on edge. “I braved a mortal crisis here to steal this! Why does it seem like it’s none of your business?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know what this is? Do you know of its commemorative value?! Do you know…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What you stole is mine.” Xu Yangyi laughed, “I’ll give you a week. Propose a complete medicinal pill promotion project. If you don’t accomplish it, I’m going to switch managers. Besides, I need three months to refine twelve medicinal pills. I can give them to you to advertise.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need!” Mao Ba’er and Li Zongyuan began to shriek almost in unison. “Media hype?! Unnecessary!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Auction! An auction sale! It has to be auctioned!!!” Mao Ba’er’s eyes emitted the brilliance of money. “I fucking guarantee that the entire cultivation world is going to go wild because of this!!!”</span></p>

  <p>1. Huan Huan is the name of a main character from a Chinese drama called “The Empresses in the Palace”. Huan Huan is supposed to be kind of a lonesome but lovely young woman who seeks the emperor’s favor. Apparently, Mao Ba’er really likes this show. <a href="#footnote-ref-b82d"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

 <div id="footnote-c33e">
  <p>2. I think what Xu Yangyi is referring to here is that he gained the Eternal Alchemy Canon for the first time from the Burning Heavens Revelation (which was a ruined partial off-shoot) and then the Eternal Alchemy Canon is so ancient that it doesn’t translate well into modern speech (seconds versus breaths), so it is a “second time”. <a href="#footnote-ref-c33e"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-9aac">
  <p>3. As ever, Mao Ba’er is one for eloquence. Few things about his speech. The word “damn” here is Chinese slang for “p*n*s”. In Chinese this is stylized as J8, since the word for p*n*s is the pinyin “ji1ba1” The 8 in chinese is ba, so this is why this slang is formed like this. In case its not obvious, when Xu Yangyi tells Mao Ba’er to order dessert, its him telling Mao Ba’er to screw himself because dogs and chocolate are a no-go. I guess I’ll add another thing here. Whenever you see me censor something as %#@^, it’s not really me censoring, but more of a “fill in the blank” of how awful something is. The most literal thing that is being said in such circumstance is “your mother’s v*g*n*”. Not exactly easy to localize and sound good. “Hot damn” in Chinese is literally “That’s a prostitute/hooker”. Has the connotation of “Holy sh*t/F*cking Hell” <a href="#footnote-ref-9aac"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
