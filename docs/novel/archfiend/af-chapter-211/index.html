 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amitabha…” At this moment, following a chant, Fahui came along with a khakkara in his hand. His expression was devoid of happiness and sorrow. He strolled over like he was idly sauntering in a courtyard. <span id="footnote-ref-4e59"><a href="#footnote-4e59">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the wake of each of his steps, all the wilted lotus leaves parted one by one. He didn’t extend his hand to push aside the swath of lotus leaves, but they directly made a path. Fahui walked straight before everyone. His eyes flashed with a vigorous glint, and he glanced deeply at the Heavenmend Stone. He recited a chant, “Amitabha… I never expected that such a legendary item would actually exist here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you fire that arrow?” Xu Yangyi raised his head. Calmly, he asked the man in the sky with nigh callousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And what of it?” the man stared blankly and sneered, “Do you even have the qualifications to lay a finger on such a marvelous treasure as the commander of a trifling A-rank legion?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is a sin to hold this delusion.” Like he was looking at a dead man, he eyed Xu Yangyi. “You should rejoice. Fortunately, you didn’t get the Heavenmend Stone, otherwise, you would already be dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi nodded, not wasting a further word. His hand moved into his pocket, and he closed his eyes and began meditate. At this moment… no one could act rashly! It was unknown how many people had come here… no one was willing to play the mantis in between the cicada and oriole.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nangong Xiaoran…” Sister Nine glanced at the camouflaged man with icy eyes. “I didn’t expect that the Nangong Clan’s dog nose would be as quick as it was in the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Xiaoran snorted coldly. He simply refused to acknowledge her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently in the sky, three cold stars approached. Greenwall’s Three Swords had come together. Just as they arrived, three gazes flickered towards the Heavenmend Stone in the middle. In a flash, they fired up. Shortly afterwards, they studied everyone present and began to wisely meditate at the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one dared to make the first move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s here too.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Amidst his meditation, Ling Xiaozi’s spiritual sense said to Xuan Chengzi,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If we act later, leave him to me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Junior Brother…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Xuan Chengzi was silent for brief moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now’s not the time to let emotions affect your decisions. There’s an extreme chance that this object is the legendary Heavenmend Stone. If its used to nourish a sword core, not only can we reach Core Formation… even Nascent Soul isn’t impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Xiaozi smiled faintly and said no more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed on by the minute and second. After ten minutes, following the sound of rustling lotus leaves being pushed aside, three cultivators wearing white changpaos wordlessly arrived to the present scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The CSIB’s science exploration group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three late-stage Qi Condensation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were the same as the others, merely skimming the area with their eyes. They didn’t say anything and sat straight down to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten minutes passed. Half an hour passed. An hour passed… After a full four hours, everyone had arrived here. The Ye Clan’s five people, the Yi Clan’s four people, Buddhism’s eleven people, the Ming Clan’s seven people, the CSIB’s group of three people, the Nangong Clan’s six people, and Daoism’s trio. In addition to the Xingtian Legion’s six people… only forty-five people had found the true passage when over a hundred people had entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All without sufficient qualifications had been eliminated outside the honeycomb wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quan Ningyue, Zhan Twelve, Li Zongyuan, Mao Ba’er, and Fang Cheng stood collectively behind Xu Yangyi. Fang Cheng’s and Quan Ningyue’s gazes as they looked at the Heavenmend Stone carried a tangible, roiling heat. Their breathing was rather coarse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“S-Spud…” Mao Ba’er’s voice was trembling. “T-T-This is a destiny… A true great destiny… The Rootless Nine Bends Aqua… is totally nothing in comparison… Take it! We gotta take it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, Commander!” Quan Ningyue’s expression was also terribly grave. “In case we get it… I think Master will definitely use his full strength to help you forge a true magik treasure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Cheng was solemn-faced as well and said, “I once heard Master-Ancestor say… passed down to the present, there are about three items that can act as spirit treasure embryos. One of them is the Heavenmend Stone! But Master-Ancestor also said that even he’s never seen a spirit treasure embryo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi nodded, his gaze looking at the Heavenmend Stone with passion. He was determined to win this treasure! Nonetheless, the current situation was equally dangerous! In these seemingly tranquil grounds, everyone was searching for an opportunity to take action, competing in patience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pondering for a long time, his face flickered with a smidgen of resolution. He said lowly to everyone in the Xingtian Legion, “After things start later, I can’t look after you guys. It’s very possible that each of us will be scattered. Zhan Twelve.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m giving you a special mission.” The killing intent in Xu Yangyi’s eyes faintly glinted and calmly swept over Nangong Xiaoran. “Do you have a divine ability that allows you to instantly disappear and evade pursuit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an assassin-essential divine ability. As expected, Zhan Twelve nodded. “I do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you have magik artifacts that can create a disturbance? For example, an item that can kick up smoke and dust in front of someone, and interfere with their vision and spiritual sense?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also a good carried on an assassin’s person. Zhan Twelve nodded and said, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good…” Xu Yangyi laughed and quietly said a few words to Zhan Twelve. Afterwards, he faced everyone and said, “Don’t worry… Very soon, someone won’t be able to hold themself back…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seemingly verifying his words, a voice carrying an indifferent smile suddenly rang out. “What? Could it be that all of you don’t know what this object is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one spoke, but the gazes of everyone present turned bitingly cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rearing of a head… represented that this chaotic battle was on the verge of having its curtains pulled wide open!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi took a deep breath, and his entire bodily spiritual force revolved. Silently, he stood up from his meditation stance. His gaze was seemingly careless, yet he never relaxed over the blowing wind and stirring grass in these grounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the present scene, each person was like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the person who dared rear his head at this moment… he possessed even more absolute confidence in himself and in his clan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If everyone keeps sitting around until we’re old, what’s the point of this item? If that’s the case…” A young man was dressed in an ancient tunic suit. Even though its surface was stained with splotches of blood, his entire being was like a sharp, unsheathed sword. He smiled as he stood out and cupped his hands. “It would be impolite for this Ye to refuse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as his voice fell, his entire body abruptly transformed into azure leaves and vanished from its original position. At the same time, without any warning, the Ye Clan’s five people threw themselves forward almost in sync. The picture in each of their hands unfolded in the wind, meeting the breeze and enlarging! In a flash, from about a foot in size, these pictures transformed to be over ten meters wide! The countless talismans on their surfaces glimmered and sunk towards everyone’s feet in an instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A replica of the Ye Clan’s clan-protector magik treasure, the Jadelight Diagram?” Mao Ba’er stood up with a swoosh. His canine eyes opened wide. “They actually brought that with them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clan-protector magik treasure?” Xu Yangyi furrowed his brows and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why do you think Ye, Yi, and Mo are called Humanity’s Three Clans?” Mao Ba’er nervously roved about without direction. “Each of them have a clan-protector treasure that’s been passed down for a thousand years! They don’t fall short in comparison to the legendary super-rare spirit treasures! Legend has it that they have the power to slay a Core Formation ancestor! As for the Jadelight Diagram… It’s the Ye Clan’s clan-protector magik treasure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mao Ba’er tightly locked his eyes on the scene and gritted his teeth. “Even if it’s a replica, its power can’t be underestimated at all! This Fellow Daoist… might be ranked very high in the Ye Clan’s echelon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Mao Ba’er’s voice even fell, a chant of “Amitabha” rang out. In the next moment, a large golden hand in the sky covered Cultivator Ye without a trace of benevolence. It appeared that if he didn’t stop, he would immediately be crushed into flying ash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Skanda Holds Scepter.” Fahui’s expression was still placid like a lake. Following this hand’s appearance, the bodhi rosary on his neck suddenly collapsed and divided into tens of emerald dots that charged towards the Ye Clan’s group of five. <span id="footnote-ref-c86d"><a href="#footnote-c86d">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like fireflies flying everywhere in the night, the beads unexpectedly carried brahmic chants as they flew forth. Subsequently, they became increasingly faster as they soared! One could even see the blazing trails they left in the sky due to friction!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t everything, however!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, an ancient black corpse was shrouded from head to toe with black qi. It was covered in armor yet moved like the wind. Its ten fingernails were like ten sharp swords. It oddly appeared behind Cultivator Ye, and its black fingernails sharply rose without warning! They pierced straight at the middle of Cultivator Ye’s back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of Cultivator Ye’s eyes trembled with fear, yet he simply didn’t retreat half a step. He said hoarsely, “Ancestors protect me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next second, both of his hands formed a bizarre seal. A ring-shaped blaze swiftly formed between both of his hands, and in an instant the black hilt of an unknown object slowly emerged within the flame array. He grabbed the handle and forcefully pulled. In the wake of a swoosh, a parasol embedded full of pearls and jades shockingly appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM BOOM BOOM!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a spark of flint, just as this umbrella opened, the rosary beads collided with the parasol’s surface like a meteor shower! Fiery-red ripples of spiritual force madly exploded on it! Even the ground slightly quaked because of these rosary beads! Furthermore, the surrounding wilted lotus leaves gently floated down leaf by leaf!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current conditions were like an explosive barrel filled with gunpowder, only lacking a spark. As for the Ye Clan, they took the lead to ignite the fuse! And just as this fuse was lit, the three great powers of the Ye Clan, Ming Clan, and the Buddhist Monastery took action at nearly the same time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ye Clan’s Old Four really is bold. Allow me to lend Brother Ye an arm for such a grand occasion.” Following a long chuckle, a fourth clan immediately joined the fray!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before his words finished, a sword tip as narrow and slender as a viper suddenly flashed. Like a streak of white light shining in the night, a sword gracefully ascended!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yi Old Five!!!” Cultivator Ye gnashed his teeth so hard that they chattered. Without a second word, all his bodily spiritual force completely erupted. In an instant, the manifestation of a two-meter-tall ancient cyan tree formed behind him. He shouted loudly, and tree leaves flew down. Immediately, as if the pitter-patter of rain was heard behind him, the jingle of shattered jade rang out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yi Clan’s Old Five was a thin, tall youth. In a flash, he was already thrusting out with tens of swords! The swords were aimed at vital parts. Surprisingly, this action was a killing move to eliminate the other faster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this place, there was no human or demon, only benefits and opponents!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you still looking at? COME!” Following Yi Old Five’s snarl, he slapped the crown of his head, and a white-jade sword point about a foot long whistled as it flew out! In the next second, one turned into ten, ten into a hundred, and a hundred into infinite blades! Like a sword box had been opened, countless sharp swords formed an azure sword-lotus behind him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Flower Pinch Sword Art… Azure Lotus Smiles!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh swoosh swoosh!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Swords fell like rain! Sword upon sword took aim at Cultivator Ye who was closest. The sword light reflected snowy brightness on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sword rain that blotted out the sky and concealed the earth, Ye Old Four fiercely gritted his teeth and abruptly roared towards the other side, “What are you still waiting for?! If you don’t move now, how long will you keep on waiting?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next second, three rocketing sword-lights charged straight towards Yi Old Five’s head, heart, and qi sea, piercing at these three vitals!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Greenwall’s Three Swords!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s gazes flashed. As expected… the Ye Clan had an ally! At this moment, they suddenly launched a revolt!</span></p>
