Everyone outside stood up in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“B-Breaking the bodily limiter… He’s breaking the bodily limiter!” Li Mu excitedly walked back and forth inside the room as if the advancement was his own. Even his voice was somewhat hoarse. “Once he charges through this barrier, h-he’ll be a middle-stage cultivator! The middle stage! The middle stage!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two didn’t say anything, but they were the same, unable to even stand. Instead, they perceived the sea of spiritual light in the air that had reached a zenith at this moment, their feelings a series of complications.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">was the most significant barrier of the initial stage of Qi Condensation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Strictly speaking, the bodily limiter was the only obstruction that existed in the advancement of a minor boundary in Qi Condensation. The others were all cumulative. As for this accumulation, it depended on a person’s aptitude. They had already guessed that while Xu Yangyi’s aptitude was astonishing, the bodily limiter still caused one to harbor apprehension within their heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“F-Fellow Daoist Xu seems not to have brought a supplementary medicine!” Suddenly, Zhang Gongchang couldn’t refrain from shouting, “H-He’s using pure strength to challenge the bodily limiter?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once these words were given voice to, everyone was rendered dumb. In other words… this advancement wasn’t of Xu Yangyi’s planning? That was to say… he had felt he could break through and immediately attacked? Therefore… the other hadn’t taken anything! Including supplementary pill elixir?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Careless! Too careless!” Wang Chunlai sighed deeply, his worry exhibited in his speech as if he was the one breaking through. “If he doesn’t rely on pill elixir, how is he going to break through the bodily limiter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Li, how about you bring in a bottle?” Just as Li Mu said these words, he recalled something and immediately pulled out a jade bottle. “This is the regular advancement pill elixir. If Fellow Daoist Xu doesn’t mind it, wouldn’t it be better for Fellow Daoist Li to take it in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if this person didn’t achieve the middle stage, his potential was astonishing. In case he did attain the middle stage… there would be many benefits without a single disadvantage in them setting up good relations!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Birds of a feather flock together. Fringe cultivators like them were at the very bottom of the barrel. Everyone they knew were all at the initial stage, and one or two middle-stage cultivators were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. Was there even&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">any</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;better opportunity to get into their employer’s good graces than witnessing him advance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words seemed to remind everyone, and Wang Chunlai’s eyes shimmered, and he also pulled out a jade bottle. “Inside this is pill elixir I prepared for myself. Its name is the Azureflower Jadewater! Fellow Daoist Xu surely needs this right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I…” Zhang Gongchang was sweating up a storm. To them, this opportunity could certainly be said to be considerable, yet in a reversal, he presently hadn’t brought any pill elixir!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Didn’t you guys come to do accounting?! What the heck did you bring pill elixir for?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He really did want to curse. Yet before their voices even fell, time seemed to suddenly draw down to a hundredth of a second, in the entire basement. While it was quite fleeting, everyone sensed it! Not waiting for them to react, a light echo akin to breaking glass resonated within the basement, in a twinkling! Each present cultivator understood what this was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bodily limiter had been shattered! But!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The time apart from just as Xu Yangyi shouted “break” was merely a few breaths! At this moment, Li Mu’s and Wang Chunlai’s raised hands appeared to be terribly amusing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… This is…” Wang Chunlai fell back several steps, the jade bottle grasped in his hand somewhat unsteady. “One blow… One blow to shatter the limit…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Mu looked sluggishly at the closed door. If a cultivator’s aptitude was to be discerned, advancement time was the best occasion for examination, apart from specialized tests. The size of the spiritual-light sea was the most important basis. A cultivator’s bodily storage wasn’t just dependent on the qi sea. While the qi sea was a major factor, the flesh and bones were likewise capable of storing qi. Else not, how could those terrifying divine abilities be resisted at Foundation Establishment and Core Formation? Would death not come from just sweeping the corner hem of a jacket?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only during advancement would the natural world sense how much qi a person was capable of storing and reciprocate this amount. Over ten meters, and every major clan would show consideration with great effort and attentive nurture. Twenty meters was a true genius plucked out from among ten thousand. Thirty meters was the category of a provincial paragon of Heavens Law! Forty meters… Renowned on the entire nation’s ranking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for fifty meters...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His back grew cold; it was simply unheard of! Moreover, there was the limit-breaking time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more formidable a cultivator, the faster the limit-breaking time. There were also some cultivators that didn’t rely on external forces to break the limiter. He once heard that the bodily limiter was an invisible membrane. He had asked a few times, and a middle-stage cultivator who had answered him only rolled their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’re you asking so much for? When the time comes, you’ll know</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet this wait was ten-somewhat years. Even though he hadn’t experienced it, he knew that Xu Yangyi’s limit-breaking speed… was astonishingly fast! The limit break still looming overhead, it answered a following command and was cleaved through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this space of time, they could only say nothing but a few words! Several seconds of time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fiend…” Zhang Gongchang collapsed onto a chair, with a thud. All in all, so long as he thought of this undisguised gap, his confidence would suffer an enormous blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish swish swish…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;In the cultivation room, Xu Yangyi had already stood up. He had also heard that noise a little while ago. In that twinkling, he felt that the world seemed to drone. Subsequently, while unseen, he sensed what appeared to be like breaking glass that transformed into motes of qi and scattered in the breeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this qi didn’t fade away at all, rather it was immediately attracted into his frantically absorbing qi sea! It became the remuneration of his advancement! He also felt that the world had become even more distinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, he even thought that he could use his eyes to discern the most difficult to differentiate of pixels. At the same time, his body lightened. Originally, when he hadn’t broken this bodily limiter in the past, he didn’t feel any restrictions. Yet now, he felt that his prior existence was fettered!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body appeared to float softly like a child of the wind. It seemed that with a stirring of a thought, he could go forth in any direction. However, this fluttering softness wasn’t a weakness. He was able to simultaneously feel a hidden power within his body that far exceeded the one of the past!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was up against those three scouts right now, he wouldn’t need a Spirit Traversing Talisman. He could merely rely on his own speed to chase them down! At this instant, all that remained of the revolving sea of spiritual light around him was the last ten meters. Without delay, it charged towards his body, striving to overtake itself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He promptly used Innersight, and with a glance, a spirited light flashed in his eyes. His qi sea was possibly… about 1.5-times greater than an ordinary middle-stage cultivator’s! It had transformed into a tremendous qi-transmission device!</span></p>

Externally, this change didn’t appear to be great, yet he knew the resiliency was many times stronger than the past!</span></p>

Not enough qi, then the spiritual sense won’t have the acuity to transport it where it should go. Not enough spirit stones, then while there’ll be qi throughout the air—a place to work won’t be able to be found…” He sensed the powerful strength within his body and clenched his fist. “The reason why the Eternal Alchemy Canon broadens the qi sea… is only because my qi sea is far from attaining the requirements for pill concoction… As long as advancement speed follows, this shouldn’t be a problem at all, and it’ll also be unlikely to cause my qi to make my body explode.”</span></p>

Battle perseverance will last longer,, and the meridians clearer.

However, beneath Innersight, he could see a layer of misty-white light within. This was qi reinforcing and transforming the manifestation of his body.</span></p>

What this item was couldn’t be certainly said, and it was dull without the least bit remarkability. The exterior was like a peach pit, and its surface was glossy and smooth. Yet as for this object that emerged within his qi sea, apart from a golden core and qi, what else could it possibly be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be… this is a product of cultivating the Eternal Alchemy Canon?” He was unable to make heads or tails of it. Only he cultivated this arcane effort and was the sole inheritor. Since this was his choice, he had to confront it.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, it didn’t disperse but was rather absorbed.</span></p>

Henceforth upon advancing to the middle stage, may you enjoy eternal happiness as the immortals, and your cultivation bound forwards unbridledly!” Xu Yangyi narrowed his eyes, still not having the time to carefully perceive his surroundings as he heard four orderly and deferential voices outside.&nbsp;</span></p>

At the instant the door swung open, the spiritual pressure of the middle stage of Qi Condensation spilled out like torrenting quicksilver. More importantly… was that Xu Yangyi’s present qi contained a searing heat!</span></p>

In the modern age, the characteristics of arcane efforts and so on were a total non-secret. The internet had surpassed the paper crane’s transmission of information, and there were many, many flying swords spreading knowledge. Even though it couldn’t be said that the attributes of familiar arcane efforts had been seen, they were still heard of. Yet at this moment, they were all incapable of seeing through these characteristics!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was the arcane effort that Fellow Daoist Xu cultivated? Via the senses, there was no doubt it was a fire-related arcane effort! However, how could a fire-related arcane effort possibly give off &nbsp;such a feeling from spiritual pressure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual pressure was a kind of suppressive force. For example, if you were facing a leader, you would feel the other’s aura, merely, spiritual pressure was almost tangible. Nonetheless, was one able to sense what kind of person someone was through their aura?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Impossible!</span></p>

It ended here!</span></p>

And yet his spiritual pressure oddly carried a kind of roiling heat that could cause the heart to palpitate! He seemed to be a smelting furnace in human form! A blaze made human!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too strange… What the heck was this cultivated arcane effort? What was he doing inside? His clothes were still somewhat tattered and his facial hair was still long, an appearance of just coming out from seclusion. But at this moment, not a single person dared to look straight at him! The trio dared not open their mouths again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They understood that it was the other’s state of just advancing and his cultivation having yet to stabilize that caused this leak of spiritual pressure. Such a situation wouldn’t appear in cultivators already in the middle stage for a couple years. Their spiritual pressures could be restrained and unleashed at will. In any case, as they recalled there was possibly a silent, fierce beast in human form standing besides them, everyone felt their backs grow somewhat cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi didn’t speak, slowly walking instead. The world resembled a newborn’s, seemingly novel. Each advancement wasn’t limited to cultivation, but also an upgrade in spiritual sense. Of course, the needed qi for the next advancement would be greater. Otherwise, the spiritual sense wouldn’t upgrade, and moreover be unable to keenly sense worldly qi. If greater amounts couldn’t be assimilated faster, then how would Foundation Establishment seniors and Core Formation masters break through?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that in a Core Formation cultivator’s true seclusion, an expanse of qi within a range of a fifty kilometers would tremble in wake with their breathing. It was in no way comparable to his current piddling absorption.</span></p>

This was a genuine blur of the eye; a fist came before him! It was a single millimeter away from the tip of his nose!</span></p>

But before he finished speaking, all of his hair blew back because he was next welcomed by an intense gust of wind! He couldn’t even open his eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p>

Places that this fist had waved over. Xu Yangyi pulled his hand back, nodding in satisfaction.&nbsp;</span></p>

The passion, admiration, and envy in his eyes were nearly unconcealable! This was a middle-stage cultivator’s might! That fist of moments ago seemed to be no more than inconsequential posturing, but it was a heavy sword without edge, needless of overt power to manifest great skill. Initial-stage Qi Condensation cultivators would find it absolutely difficult to resist this fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For fist wind to cause Li Zongyuan’s hair to rise back, one could imagine Xu Yangyi’s strength! There was also that banging sound. It couldn’t be anything else… It was the sound of breaking wind! The actual speed of this fist had cleaved through the air!</span></p>
