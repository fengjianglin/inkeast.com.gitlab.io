 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This auction round was different from the previous auction. This time, the entire venue floor was empty of clamor and absolutely silent, devoid of the cries of both crow and peacock. The doors of the twelve pavilions were open wide, yet what was inside couldn’t be seen clearly. Only layers of misty treasure light isolated spiritual sense and everything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoists and Ancestors.” Hundredtongues cleared his throat and forced down his excitement. This was an auction of all of China’s Core Formation cultivators! It was no exaggeration to say that it was the highest-ranking auction! If he could properly facilitate this transaction, his name of Hundredtongues would resonate through the entire auction industry!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, the auction for the final five pills will be on its way.” He said brightly, “Through the course of our Golden Dipper Hall’s discussions, we’ve decided… that the first to be auctioned among the five pills will be the one and only Minister pill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi smiled as he stood in a corner. Minister pill? He still had a few good pills in his hand. However, the rarer something was, the greater its value. On the contrary, if this one-time sale had ten Minister pills, it wouldn’t be as gorgeous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little child… don’t speak so much rubbish.” The wizened voice was heard again. “This old man has long since been waiting impatiently.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Hundredtongues’s breathing was somewhat rushed. His hand gently beckoned, and the three-mark Minister Pill leaped vividly in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ancestors… please bid!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The present venue was dead silent. It was like a tempest on the cusp of arriving on the ocean surface. The face was tranquil, yet a heart-palpitating storm was hiding below! Oddly, the Core Formation ancestors surprisingly didn’t give voice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoists are you not moving into action?” After an unknown passage of time, gentle laughter rang out from a purple pavilion. It was the unregistered Core Formation master Yue Congrao. “In that case… it would be impolite for This Dao Master to refuse.” His voice not yet fallen, the entire room shone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huff…” A Foundation Establishment cultivator gasped coldly and looked up in excitement. Above, an expanse of pure and holy golden light sprinkled, akin to the black of night suddenly transforming into the light of day. A sun penetrated the roof and countless seals spilled downwards. It was a kind of soothingly warm sensation that caused comfort to fill the entire body, bringing him now to almost overlook the immortal realm!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A large golden hand, formed completely out of qi and a full ten-odd meters in range, slowly bloomed in the sky in the shape of a fist. It was like a unique immortal flower without peer, a midnight orchid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could be said that time was slow but swift, a transformation of barely several seconds. Forthwith, the large hand opened wide, and in it was a small ebony sapling that swayed gently in the wind. Akin to stars, pearls of lights shed from the small tree. Its entire body was dark-green and even the highest-quality icy jade was far inferior to the purity of its greenness, so verdant that it was transparent! But at a glance, the tree appeared to be simply bottomless, like the soul would fall into it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the wake of this sapling’s appearance, everyone’s eyes brightened. The skin on their faces trembled so gently that it was visible like painted skin! <span id="footnote-ref-1aa2"><a href="#footnote-1aa2">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is Core Formation might…” An unknown number of people looked at everything facing them like they were in the most luxurious 3D movie theater, captivated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An old man stroked his uncontrollably twitching skin in astonishment. “That sapling… This is qi? Qi can actually prick our skin at Foundation Establishment?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How plentiful is this qi to accomplish this?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maybe this isn’t a sapling… but a minor super-grade spirit-stone vein!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is too terrifying… That qi is almost solid. It’s like I’m sitting on pins and needles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This thing…” All of a sudden, a somewhat surprised voice echoed through the auction house. Like everyone awoke from a dream, they looked towards a yellow pavilion above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancestor Titanspirit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“120 years ago…” Daomaster Titanspirit simply cared nothing for everyone else’s astonishment. As if he was calling back to his memories, he said unhurriedly, “In the surroundings of Chichen Itza, This Dao Master, along with 150 late-stage Foundation Establishment under my sect, searched together for traces of Quetzalcoatl but obtained nothing. However, we discovered a seed suspected to have been watered by the blood of a god.”<span id="footnote-ref-8ae8"><a href="#footnote-8ae8">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recounted this story blandly, yet it sent everyone on the floor who heard it, including Xu Yangyi, into racing thoughts and wild fascination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chichen Itza… Quetzalcoatl…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the world… in those lost ancient ruins, could there truly exist the vestiges of gods? Quetzalcoatl of the Myriad Gods era. Could this god still be alive in the world? If not, why would a Core formation ancestor, a supreme lord of the world, cross over a thousand mountains and endless waters to Chichen Itza? As for Xu Yangyi… would there be such a day in his future?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without anyone interrupting, Daomaster Titanspirit suddenly turned harsh in speech and said coldly, “Yes, but when I took this seed, a dispute occurred with another Core Formation cultivator shrouded entirely in a blood mist. Oddly, this Fellow Daoist surprisingly used Chinese divine abilities. In particular, the move of a palm striking the heart is still fresh in my mind… Fellow Daoist…” his voice already carried a murderous will, “that day, was it you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Congrao’s voice laughed faintly, “Isn’t it nothing more than a heavenly oddity finding home with the fated?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Never mind…” Even now, Daomaster Titanspirit’s voice was as cold as ice. “However… there was not only one opposing Core Formation master that day. I returned without achievement, but after investigating for a long time, I finally became certain of one thing…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist… do you dare tell us in the presence of Daomaster Skybearer whether or not you joined hands with the House of Dracul that day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s actually them?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A youth looked in surprise at the bestirred elders in his surroundings. He questioned softly, “Elder… this Dracul whatever… What is it?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are still too young…” The elder breathed in deeply and patted the youth’s shoulder. “Don’t tell me you believe that in today’s globalization, only our China has cultivators in that which is known as modern Cultivation Civilization?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just wait… Once you cross the doorstep of Foundation Establishment, you… will understand everything…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the name of the largest foreign clan that you should remember… Their leading clan elder is known as Vlad Dracul… His sons are all named Vlad Tepes Dracul…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the auction house, Yue Congrao laughed grimly, saying nothing at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The present floor was stretch of deathly stillness. After ages, Daomaster Skybearer said indifferently, “Each world and each nation possesses their own seal from ancient to modern times. Such as the Nine Regions Immortal Execution Array in China’s sky. This is no secret. So long as one treads into Foundation Establishment, all will be made aware.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If a country’s cultivators at Core Formation or above enter the boundary of another nation, they are bound to suffer weakness by a great formation. In the world, the current several strongest nation-protector arrays are the Nine Regions Immortal Execution Array, India’s Grand Burning Heavens Array, and Greece’s Olympus Myriad Deities Array. All of them are like this. If it really was Fellow Daoist Yue that day, you surely chose to act together with a matching Core Formation cultivator of another nation. This in itself is not totally unpardonable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao Master, are you not intending to investigate?” Titanspirit snorted coldly. “This is one of the world’s several archdevils, listed as wanted by the CSIB for a century! An astronomical bounty of 580 billion American dollars…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Put an end to this,” Daomaster Skybearer said insipidly. “Proceed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daomaster Titanspirit said no more, but everyone present, including Xu Yangyi, suddenly sensed… their blood rushed to their heads in an instant! Their complexions all started to redden! In a flash, their blood calmed down, yet charged up to the crowns of their heads again in the next second! Cycling like so! At the same time, the distinct sound of breathing resounded at everyone’s ear side!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This… is Daomaster Titanspirit’s breathing in extreme fury!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi stifled his feeling of vertigo and lifted his head in shock to look at Daomaster Titanspirit’s pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a Core Formation master. Merely breathing possessed a deadly effect towards low-level cultivators! After several seconds, this sound of breathing calmed. In the venue, it was unknown how many people were slick with cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yue Congrao’s voice had never changed and faintly laughed as before. “Fellow Daoist Titanspirit has already spoken quite detailedly on the origin of this tree. In the world, there is only this tree…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enormous golden hand faintly flickered, and immediately, of the several thousand green leaves on the sapling, a green leaf, the youngest of the young and only the size of an infant’s fingernail, slowly floated down in awesomeness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quote a price.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The auction floor was silent for two seconds and then boiled over with a rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… was truly bathed in a god’s blood? This is a massive destiny!” An aged cultivator nearly stood up, his eyes open wide and staring fixedly at the green fluttering leaf. He almost rushed forth and grabbed it in his hand yet was contained by his barely remaining wisdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Say no more…” Another middle-aged Foundation Establishment cultivator’s eyes burned with fire. “The qi nurtured within it can prick my skin even if it’s so far away! It’s obvious… Plain to see!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end though, no one knew what it could be used for. However, just by attracting two of China’s Core Formation cultivators and a matching foreign Core Formation cultivator to jointly fight over it was sufficient to demonstrate its value!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi took a step forward. In this instant, he felt… a kind of intolerable fluctuation come from his dantian! It was… the silkworm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the ordinarily peaceful silkworm suddenly began to berserk. It used its soft and plump body to forcefully knock against the qi cage that Xu Yangyi had made for it within his dantian. Nonetheless, its strength was too feeble, simply without the slightest impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi’s hanging gaze concealed the contemplation in his eyes. He wordlessly continued to sit in his seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The green leaf seemed to float forever, but in fact floated over the massive light screen. In a twinkling, several words on the light screen began to frantically pulse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi looked at the light screen, not batting an eye. Just now, Hundredtongues had explained to him that the color green represented a C-rank heavenly treasure. Blue represented B-rank and afterwards…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his eyes, there was almost no degree of pause! The green leaf had already flushed blue!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple! An A-rank spirit object! At this time, even Yue Congrao seemed to be dazed. He didn’t expect that a recently sprouted shoot would surprisingly attain the level of an A-rank spirit object! In his pavilion, he deeply studied the sapling on the palm. In that case… what was the rank of the sapling’s whole body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is it possible… Quetzalcoatl truly exists in the world? Or perhaps did exist? Is this tree—truly like the clue I found in that little village—actually watered with the blood of a god? In this world… I stand at the summit of Core Formation, yet there are still secrets I don’t know of? Maybe that’s to say… even Core Formation doesn’t have the adequate qualifications to explore it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Purple!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“An A-rank spirit object!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My heavens! A single showing yields an A-rank spirit object! This is the auction of Core Formation ancestors?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe, because of this trip today, this life has not been in vain. A life worthy of living, heh…”</span></p>
