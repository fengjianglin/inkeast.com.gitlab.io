He still hadn’t regained his bearings from his prior shock. From what outsiders could see, Xu Yangyi was testing the power of the middle stage, however, it wasn’t just this alone. Xu Yangyi was also reminding him not to make any dirty moves, otherwise, he would come to an end!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi pointed at him. “Come.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zongyuan gritted his teeth, waveringly taking aim at Xu Yangyi. He closed his eyes and squeezed the trigger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi was standing in place, and a tiny bullet hole appeared on his chest. He undid his clothes to take a look, the flesh beneath faintly reddened. Surprisingly, the bullet tumbled into his clothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh…” Wang Chunlai smiled wryly to himself. Regardless of the number of times, this was something that middle-stage cultivators had to test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the initial stage, gunshot wounds were still able to cause traumatic injuries, but in the middle stage… ordinary firearms wouldn’t even pierce the skin! This was the direct result of the final ten meters of the spiritual-light sea that drilled into Xu Yangyi’s bones, transforming his flesh and internal organs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi’s skin was like bronze and his bones were like iron. His speed, reaction, and power, all were over a hundred times beyond a mortal! A true transcendence! From here onwards, humans, the race, were gradually growing distant to him, a middle-stage cultivator, an outstanding divide. Resisting a gun was already enough to state that he had taken the initial step into the immortal path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi calmly held the bullet. In his heart, a quiet sigh of emotion bubbled in his mind. The middle stage… He was finally at the middle stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At eight, he entered Heavens Law. At thirteen, he began drawing qi into the body. At twenty-one, he tried assailing the middle stage for the first time but was unexpectedly obstructed. Three years later, he attacked once again, breaking through in one go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he also wasn’t sure if he could say if these three years could be considered within the limit of his cultivation time. Truly… these affairs could be considered matters of the past. The recruitment fight of major powers on the airplane, and his scuffle with Chu Zhaonan. The bitter competition of the Qualifier, Vermilion Snow’s massacre of Heavens Law, and then Thousandedge’s scouts hunting him down...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In three years, there were many changes but also many experiences. Nevertheless, he held no regrets. Even if he was lonely and even if he was solitary, such a feeling as oneself as god, such a powerful sensation of true existence, the hatred he shouldered, and these people showing reverence to him, of any of these, which one of these things didn’t come through cultivation in full?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was never a matter that the Heavenly Dao reaped without sowing. To wish to stand at the world’s apex, possess a lifespan forbidden to ordinary people, and observe the vicissitudes of the world’s affairs like a deity, but be incapable of enduring the loneliness, then why even cultivate? Why defy the heavens?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Dao rewarded the diligent and was always impartial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gently rolling the burning-hot bullet between his fingers, Xu Yangyi then transformed it into flat metal. Yet in the next second, everyone was completely dazed! This was because a fire had appeared in his hand. For any cultivator, it wasn’t strange at all to create the Five Phases from nothing. What was strange was… <span id="footnote-ref-1a09"><a href="#footnote-1a09">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fire… was different from ordinary fire! Its temperature far exceeded ordinary fire! Li Mu, Wang Chunlai, and Zhang Gongchang were even separated by several meters, but they could even feel the scorched flavor in the air. The air currents in the entire room seemed to fuel it, and space appeared hazy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What… What powerful strength…” Zhang Gongchang forcefully gulped and fell back several steps, his heart beating wildly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was no fire that a cultivator could ordinarily produce… From its might, he knew just from looking that this flame was much, much more intense than any common flame he could make! He even had a feeling that so long as this fire touched him, it was capable of turning him into flying ash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the same vein, Li Mu, Wang Chunlai, and Li Zongyuan looked at this fire in astonishment. It was unrestrained and carefree, and it flickered with infinite changes in mere moments. From time to time, it was like a fluttering butterfly on Xu Yangyi’s finger, and occasionally it was like a snarling tiger. At the beginning… its power was great, and even now it was still great! A kind of terrifying might, completely reserved, could only be vaguely felt, yet none wished to test it whatsoever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sizzle…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;In less than a second, the bullet transformed into molten iron and fell to the ground. On the ground, a scorched black hole appeared. The sizzling noise was gentle, but at this instant, it was incomparably distinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi pulled his hand back in satisfaction. With his initial understanding of the Fire Manipulation Art and the increase of his spiritual sense and power, he was quite pleased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” Zhang Gongchang suddenly remembered something and looked to his two other co-workers, in shock. “This… This is Pill-Elixir Fire?!” Before his voice even fell, Wang Chunlai’s and Li Mu’s eyes became blazed to life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was an alchemist? To say it without the least bit exaggeration, it was a person wholly removed from the likes of them! A difference of heaven and earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pill-Elixir Fire?!” Li Mu dumbly looked at Zhang Gongchang for a moment and suddenly turned to Xu Yangyi. “Congratulations F-Fellow Daoist for congealing an alchemy flame! Felicitations to the Fellow Daoist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Chunlai was dazed for several seconds. Afterwards, his eyes reddened, and he clasped his hands with a shrill voice. “Congratulations, Fellow Daoist! My felicitations to the Fellow Daoist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pill-Elixir Fire? On the contrary, Xu Yangyi was stunned. What the hell was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze swept over Li Zongyuan and also discovered an amazed look stretching across the other’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the look in Xu Yangyi’s eyes, Li Zongyuan’s first reaction wasn’t “you don’t know?”, but rather a deep bow at the waist that seemed to have been fired off. “Master! Pill-Elixir Fire is the most apex flame in the Dao of Alchemy! Although a vast majority of pill elixirs use apparatuses in production, those… are of the common type!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Genuine pill-elixir, the most supreme pill-elixirs, are all privately custom-made! Ones unable to be emulated by the use of apparatuses! A grand pill-elixirist has to refine it by hand and seal the elixir! A pill elixir like this…” Li Zongyuan’s voice trembled in excitement, “is valued at a million… no! Ten million spirit stones!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for those who have condensed Pill-Elixir Fire… even among grand pill-elixirist, not even a tenth of masters have one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi understood one matter. It seemed… that those who were capable of forming Pill-Elixir Fire… were quite few? However, his fire wasn’t just any pill-elixir variant.</span></p>

So long as Xu Yangyi said the word, all of Li Zongyuan’s past grievances would fade away without a trace!</span></p>

This is the magik treasure that each great clan and major power uses to coax the people’s hearts. Along with supplementary crafts, they can be jointly named as a two-horse chariot. If one doesn’t join these major powers, it’s very hard to get a hold of a divine ability. Among us demons, a lucky person with a high bloodline-concentration might be able to enlighten themselves in one or two moves from bloodline inheritance. As for common cultivators, who would have such an item…”</span></p>

This was because a roaming flame-dragon had appeared before him. Xu Yangyi narrowed his eyes and propped his chin with his hand. In the wake of his fingertips stirring, the roaming dragon moved along with his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wandering dragon was no less than three to four meters long, vivid like life.

It wasn’t the cheap and ordinary Wind Edge Technique and it wasn’t the divine abilities of a low-rank arcane effort like the Hundred Solutions. Instead, it was a bonafide ancient inheritance that far outstripped the Burning Heavens Revelation, the acquisition of the first divine ability after obtaining the elementary qualifications!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No… to say such wouldn’t be wholly correct. The first move was the Fire Manipulation Art; he had gained two divine abilities! One was the supplementary Wind Brandishes Traces, and the second was this offensive one!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wind aids the strength of the fire, and the fire lends to the might of the wind! He had continued to believe the Wind Brandishes Traces was a divine ability, but just over the course of burning the furnace fire for six hours, this move, a true divine ability, suddenly emerged within his mind! This was the first killing divine-ability of the Eternal Alchemy Canon. Wind Brandishes Traces was no more than a supplementary arcane effort!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It shall be called… the Ten Cardinals Red Lotus.” He sensed the roaring, everlasting fire-dragon coil around him. The fluctuation of roiling heat caused him to inwardly nod. Through special methods to draw worldly qi and use oneself as a conduit to release this qi, this was a divine ability. It… could take the original move of the common, widespread Fireball Technique and transform it into all kinds of different appearances. It possessed a completely different might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, his unique divine ability, the Ten Cardinals Red Lotus, held a strength that was twenty-two times greater than the Fireball Technique. This power comprised explosive force, sustainability, and destructive power. Moreover, it also carried its own uncontested valor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon meeting water, it would not be quenched. Upon encountering wind, it would not be extinguished. Without seizing a target to cinders, it absolutely wouldn’t die! In particular… he still had an idea within his heart which he hadn’t validated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And that was between these two moves born from the Fire Manipulation Art of the Eternal Alchemy Canon, was it a possible… that both sides could unite? Then maybe the true might of the Ten Cardinals Red Lotus demanded the corresponding use of the Wind Brandishes Traces? Or perhaps… the addition of Life Sacrification?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it wasn’t necessary to tell these matters to anyone.

Since he left the academy, like Chu Zhaonan had recognized him, he also only recognized the other. Back then, that bullet which had disabled him from gathering qi nearly spelled his doom. He really did want to use this move against Chu Zhaonan and roast him to a crisp—of course, the other’s clothes would be lost afterwards, and the gunslinger would have to head out into the heart of the provincial plaza.</span></p>

How could he be unaware? Were it not for forced circumstances, demons were otherwise no way willing to serve as a familiar. He could determine the other’s life or death with a single thought, yet to have a willing assistant was leagues better than an unwilling one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi buried his excitement within his heart. He inhaled deeply and gradually settled his mind. Since he broke through the middle stage and grasped the initial Fire Manipulation Art of the Eternal Alchemy Canon, an esotericism of this divine ability had appeared in his mind. However, another one caused his heart to stir even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was… he could vaguely sense the location of the Vermilion Bird Fire! It flashed momentarily and died away, but it deeply engraved an image within his mind. An expanse… a boundless grassland. In this grassland, a tranquil and bending stream flowed. Behind it, there was a verdant cliff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet this seemed to be a jigsaw puzzle. After his initial mastery of the Fire Manipulation Art, something similar to a grainy picture flickered within his mind. Wind Brandishes Traces seemed to be a hand that wiped away at the surface of a region of grit. He couldn’t see any more.</span></p>

It was a strand… of inexplicable spiritual sense. It wasn’t strong, and although its realm couldn’t be confirmed, he felt that it shouldn't have surpassed Foundation Establishment. However, the Spirit Flame carried within it the wisp of a deep, eternally ancient flavor, seemingly capable of rendering a man into waste under a glance.</span></p>

Three more steps and then he would be able to clearly see the whole picture and understand where the Vermilion Bird Fire was!

Right now, we ourselves don’t have anything. Other people have to at least bring a gift when they come visit for the first time. Also, we still don’t know how long you’re going to cultivate here for. It’s well and fine to meet these neighbors. Master, you are from a prestigious house, the orthodoxy of Heavens Law.
