 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hold your tongue!” Before Cao Mosheng’s voice even fell, Cao Yun had already pulled him over fiercely and firmly pushed him down on the sofa, looking into his eyes and saying loud and clear, “I am telling you, there are men that cannot be weighed by wealth in this world. Yes… these men, there are indeed people in the world that can rival them, that can shake those mega corporations to their very core. Examples like China’s Imperial Qin Court, Britain’s DuPont Family, or a few of Japan’s major financial groups… however, our Sanshui City’s Cao Family isn’t any big deal!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even the world’s authorities can only use wealth and their enormous connections to trade with him. When did it become your turn to speak? Isn’t our Cao Family as big as an ant in comparison to those peak powers?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I brought you here in order to let that man know of my good faith! Not so you could anger him! How many times have I told you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words seemed to exhaust his entire body of strength. He sat down in disappointment and leaned against the sofa, shutting his eyes. “Mosheng… you should be sensible… There’ll inevitably be a day where grandfather won’t be able to keep carrying on. I regret… I really regret… spoiling you so much… Tonight, just stand there obediently and don’t say anything… Promise, grandfather, alright?” <span id="footnote-ref-c681"><a href="#footnote-c681">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng was dazed, believing he’d heard wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His grandfather had told him before that they were going to see a man. His grandfather, as the present family patriarch and sitting chairman, and Cao Mosheng, the next patriarch and next chairman, had to treat this person properly. He had originally believed it was someone that they had to meet, but it surprisingly turned out to be the new police captain!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the present, Cao Yun had went so far as to say that even Tie Xue, the sitting chair of China’s premier corporation the Imperial Qin Court, had to treat such a person equally in the prime of his years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A person… dressed so casually, the sum value of his clothes equal to less than 500 RMB?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Promise me!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he even finished thinking, his grandfather’s voice rang out once again. It wasn’t until he firmly clenched his teeth a few times did Cao Mosheng lower his head, his lips set in a deep line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Got it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only then did Cao Yun truly release his bated breath. Soon after, he looked at Manager Su nervously and pursed his lips. “Ms. Su… This time… their branch wouldn’t know, right…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Manager Su was evidently stunned, sighing faintly, “The branch...?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know what kind of place it is, either… Legend says that it’s a mystical world… A real world of immortals… In the myths, it’s said monsters can be seen and there are warriors that can split and hack mountains apart into rubble… Hehe, but it’s only a legend… Lord Yun, this isn’t enough to believe in, but I dare to be sure of two matters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked at Cao Yun deeply. “One, the key to enter the ‘truth’ is there. The cornerstone. The starting point.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The truth…” The hoarseness of Cao Yun’s voice contained immense emotion, and he laughed bitterly. “What truth… The so-called ‘true world’?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps.” Manager Su’s eyes carried the same unequalled yearning. “This key… The second matter I can confirm is that the Cao Family still hasn’t drawn the key to be considered important.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Yun was silent for a moment, and he unexpectedly laughed, “Is that so… I can set my worries aside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tch…” Cao Mosheng sneered, his eyes carrying a cold light as he swept them over Manager Su. It was at this time the sound of knocking echoed out. He had discovered a startling matter once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Manager Su stood up immediately and tidied her make-up again. As for Cao Yun, he deeply inhaled several times, not tarrying in the slightest to stand up, only…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng didn’t know whether or not it was an illusion, but he thought to himself… was his grandfather’s face trembling?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why!? Because of what!? Excitement? Fear?! Are you fucking kidding me?!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng’s complexion was terribly gloomy.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Just a captain… I want to see how great your background is to make grandfather lower his head to you like this!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You better pray it’s great… otherwise, tomorrow will be the day you’re sent scrambling out of Sanshui City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I hope I haven’t come late.” Xu Yangyi entered through the door. As for the matter of Manager Su failing to change her shoes, the meaning was rather clear:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">please, as you will</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">. <span id="footnote-ref-551c"><a href="#footnote-551c">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nevertheless, Xu Yangyi still changed into slippers accordingly. His gaze stretched a little onwards, and he laughed. “You didn’t tell me there would be other guests tonight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m extremely sorry!” In Cao Mosheng’s astonished gaze, Cao Yun nearly bowed to the floor. “I am your humble servant Cao Yun. This is my grandson, Cao Mosheng. We are truly ashamed to look upon the Immortal Master… Please, we beg your forgiveness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandfather.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut the hell up!” Before Cao Mosheng’s voice even fell, Cao Yun’s entire head was dotted with cold sweat. He straightened out, looking at Cao Mosheng resentfully for failing to meet his expectations. “Remember my words!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng was stunned. It was beyond his expectations that his grandfather would surprisingly admonish him in front of a total stranger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chinese people paid particular attention to face. But now that major business was being discussed, he’d actually been rebuked?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Son of a bitch</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">… In his heart, he silently cursed, and an icy edge emerged in his eyes. Coldly sweeping his eyes towards Xu Yangyi, he feigned deference and stood over at the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe…” Manager Su faintly laughed and carried over a pot of coffee. The look in her eyes full of meaning, she deeply eyed the youthful face of Cao Mosheng, who was incapable of concealing his inner thoughts. She took a cup and placed it on the table. “Sir Cao, we can be considered acquaintances, but tonight I can’t help you plead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not necessary.” Cao Mosheng forcefully choked back on his anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Cao Yun nearly spat out blood. This child was raised from childhood to be spoiled and pampered, however, in the Cao Family’s three successions of sons, his father had passed away in a car accident. The family’s great properties and estates could only be given to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even now… at this critical juncture… he had actually blurted nonsense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it.” Xu Yangyi lit a cigarette. “It’s no biggie. It’s problematic to demand the wealthy son of a multi-million-dollar company to treat a pauper like me who gets a thousand in allowance every month politely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng laughed. A thousand, was this supposed to be an allowance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You better pray you got something important, worthy of my grandfather’s attention…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He wore a bloodthirsty smile as he lowered his head, licked at his chapped lips, and noted darkly to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise… I don’t mind letting you know who's got the final say in Sanshui City…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t continue speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mr. Xu, a great person is of great capacity.” Cao Yun released his held-in breath, and gritted his teeth. “He ran off…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, if Xu Yangyi still didn’t know who they were then he was truly an idiot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sanshui City had a few corporations that formed its backbone. They could be said to be Sanshui City’s gods of wealth, great tax-paying households. Venture Pharmaceuticals run by Sanshui’s Cao Family was among one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could be said he still hadn’t guessed who Cao Yun and Cao Mosheng were, or perhaps it could be said that he hadn’t connected them to Venture Pharmaceuticals. But the words “he ran off” explained everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did the toad know that Xu Yangyi hadn’t died, he also knew that Xu Yangyi had even killed the berserker that no one in Sanshui City had dared to act against. How could he still risk continuing to reside in the city?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi was reminded of his first matter of business, and that was to flay that toad’s skin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was unable to tolerate deceit, especially since he’d gambled with his own life this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the Cao Family… had spoken truthfully. If it weren’t for them coming to knock on his door, he would’ve even forgotten this name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How long did he escape ago?” He asked without much thought. The toad’s escape came to him as no surprise. He had been left asleep for the past ten-odd days. Would the toad keep waiting, standing stiff like a corpse?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s been over ten days…” Cao Yun wiped away at his sweat, wanting to sit but not daring to. “After Chief Zheng said the killer was apprehended… he specifically asked about your condition… Chief Zheng simply didn’t know about his inside information… Afterwards, he…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Embezzled some funds and took off.” Manager Su poured a cup of coffee for Xu Yangyi, gently laughing, “Five million was the greatest sum he could transfer within a week. You know, with his skill, even if he was lousy, he could leave Sanshui’s security system without the slightest awareness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sofa was pretty comfortable… Compared to the stiff and plank-like “sofa” at Heavens Law, it was much more cozy. Xu Yangyi was so lazy that he didn’t want to move. With a wave of his hand, he brought a cup of coffee to himself using a simple attraction technique. The cup gently floated over to his mouth, and he lightly pursed his lips. Before he even opened his mouth, an abrupt shattering noise pierced everyone’s eardrums.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I-It’s f-f-f-flying?!” At this moment, Cao Mosheng’s eyeballs went round and his mouth hung ajar. He looked on in horror at everything occurring in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What in the blazes was going on!? Had he suddenly passed through into some cultivation novel?! No… this was a dream. This was definitely a dream!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He fiercely clenched his fist but discovered his palm had been painfully pricked by his fingernails. Whipping his head around, he looked at the taciturn Cao Yun and said shakily, D-D-Demon! G-Grandfather! Demon! He’s a demon! A demon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi looked at the floating cup of coffee at the side of his mouth in amazement. Beside him, Manager Su couldn’t help but giggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A demon…?” she said somewhat meaningful, “A bonafide demon… Little brother, you’ve never even seen one…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up!” Presently, Cao Yun felt incomparably complex within his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his encounter with the toad, he held selfish motives. He couldn’t be considered a good person, and to seize the other’s health supplement secret formula, he’d sought several underground organizations to make the other “disappear”. However, the final thing he saw was a youth sitting atop a pile of corpses, smiling at him with a mouth dripping with blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past few years, he watched blankly as the toad didn’t age but was virtually powerless to act! Moreover, even if he desired to make a move, Venture Pharmaceuticals’ major scale of operations simply didn’t allow him to relinquish the other!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, he knew… he had encountered a calamitous thing… when the youth in his third year hadn’t even grown taller nor grown older.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Manager Su had found him. He knew there were some things he wasn’t allowed to touch… but now that things had already been touched, what was there to be done! The strange youth was a poppy that would spell his doom! He was incapable of breaking free! He also didn’t want to be freed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hidden. That which was hidden had to be concealed beneath the cloak of darkness! It wasn’t that Heavens Law didn’t have someone come, but in such a situation the toad was disinclined to care, even with someone coming. However… things weren’t the same this time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to Manager Su, the champion of Yuyang City had now arrived! Furthermore, the toad and this man even had a fatal skirmish! When the toad could no longer be met, Cao Yun knew that imminent crisis was approaching Venture Pharmaceuticals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t wait at all for Xu Yangyi to come find him, instead bribing the entire hospital. As soon as Xu Yangyi had awakened, he’d spent two million to get Manager Su to bring Xu Yangyi for a talk, if only for a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng didn’t know anything about this whatsoever. He only looked at the leisurely and content Xu Yangyi like he’d seen a ghost. His lips quivered, and his forehead was slick with cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subsequently, he looked towards his silent grandfather again and the comfortable Manager Su. Several minutes later, he vacantly swept his trembling finger across the living room, his voice like grinding rust. “Y-You guys both knew… Am I right…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandfather… Ms. Su... Tell me… a-am I dreaming?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You aren’t dreaming.” Manager Su parted her lips and took a sip of coffee. “Your grandfather has already reminded you a good many times, and I have reminded you, as well. There are some things, even with the Cao Family’s foundation, which bottom lines still can’t be touched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng gaped several times, unable to say a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An immortal art… This was an immortal art! Heavens… The things found in novels and television actually existed in reality! What had he provoked? A true demon? An immortal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no wonder… no wonder Manager Su had warned him again… No wonder his grandfather had warned him once more… He’d envisioned an awful lot, such as the strength of the other’s background and so on, yet he absolutely didn’t expect…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That this man was simply beyond comprehension!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re pretty smart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Mosheng’s thoughts nervously scrambled to the nth degree, yet Xu Yangyi didn’t plan to pay any heed to him. On the contrary, he looked at Cao Yun and said, “I was just getting ready to handle this business and return. At most to remind you, but you delivered yourselves to my door. And I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mr. Xu!” Against expectation, Cao Yun didn’t dare to let Xu Yangyi speak. The other appeared not to take the matter seriously, but he didn’t have such a luxury! What was the intent of the other’s “reminder”? To what degree? He certainly didn’t want to risk spurring the entire Cao Family into mobilization!</span></p>
