 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 251: Treasures</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything that had transpired within the Core Formation palace was an absolute mystery to Xu Yangyi. Even what he would do after reaching Foundation Establishment was unclear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In China, there were less than 20,000 Foundation Establishment cultivators. There were even less who presumptuously guessed about what they wanted to do and how to accomplish it. All of this was unrealistic, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in the water, viewed through rose-tinted glasses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xu Yangyi clearly understood two things. The first would be his actions in the aftermath of this colossal qi reparation in Longsu Province. If he could take hold of an amazing cultivation paradise, such as in the vicinity of the heavenbound door, then his cultivation some day—and as well as the Xingtian Legion’s strength—would advance. There were a hundred benefits without a single harm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second, a hero needed three supporting pillars. These words weren’t false. There was never such a record of one who cultivated to Core Formation alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Branchmaster Xu, we’ve arrived.” A smiling voice pulled Xu Yangyi from the his diverging thoughts. He stowed his gaze and discovered that he was already standing in an empty and spacious area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This region was large, no less than several hundred meters all around. However, compared to the ten-odd-kilometer-long palace, it was nothing but a mere corner. And yet, there was nothing here, only two twenty-meter-tall qilin statues. On left and right, they stood at both sides in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is?” Xu Yangyi looked at the young cultivator doubtingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young cultivator laughed and murmured, “Branchmaster Xu, Ancestor has a secret command. What you’re entering isn’t the Featherwood Guard’s treasury… but Ancestor’s own treasury.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi’s gaze flickered. So that was saying that as a disciple of a Core Formation master, there were still some conveniences after all?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His cultivation time was still short, and he didn’t clearly understand the qi reparation’s change regarding Longsu Province and the cultivation world. But such action by his master-ancestor was warning him… that the opponent this time was absolutely unlike those he’d encountered in the past. They were rather difficult to provoke?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his contemplations, the young cultivator formed seals with both of his hands and produced two talismans at his left and right. White and black, they flew straight into the mouths of the two stone qilins. Shortly afterwards, the two stone qilins seemed to come alive. In harmony, four eyes shot out white spiritual light. In the place where they converged together, the lights twisted and wound around each other. Surprisingly, they formed a white qi formation that covered the surroundings with talismans a couple seconds later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please, Branchmaster Xu.” The young cultivator made an inviting gesture. “I’ll have to mention in passing that Ancestor specifically commanded that you can take anything inside that will be useful in restoring your left arm as you please. All of this will be converted into achievement merit value. In the future, it will be settled lump sum.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi took a deep breath and nodded, flashing into the formation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;was the world’s apex, the treasury of a Core Formation ancestor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he still had the Azure Snake Treasury located at the summit of Hunan Province’s Tianzi Mountain and also the Goldbrick Treasury of Jinshan Temple’s Fahai. Nonetheless, Xu Yangyi believed that while the items of these two treasuries would admittedly empower him, it might only be of an even profounder and long-lasting influence. But still, they were distant waters unable to quench a near thirst, unlike Ancestor Ancientpine’s treasury,.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, splendid light flashed. As he opened his eyes, even he couldn’t help but gasp. He no longer knew where this place was. He was standing atop a stone bridge in a room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bridge floor was smooth white marble. The sky was a towering round dome, carved with the seemingly lifelike images of ancient cultivators and flying immortals. Four small waterfalls flowed straight down from the mouths of four dragon-shaped holes. Xu Yangyi looked down. Below was a pond of jade water and lotus flowers. This flower, greatly related to Daoism, Buddhism, and even Confucianism, was blooming on the lake below in abundance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His distance from the pond wasn’t great. At most, it was estimated to be twenty or thirty meters. However, the focus of his attention at this moment wasn’t the pond. This room didn’t possess normal lighting fixtures. Furthermore, it wasn’t illuminated with spirit jades. Nevertheless, auspicious jewel light and treasure qi covered the sky! It caused each step to seem as if one was in an immortal realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the hundred-meter-sized room, the stone bridge was only ten meters wide. On both sides of the stone bridge, there were four sculptures that were no less than several tens of meters tall! They were carved, jutting out from the lake water. Only by climbing over the bridge by ten-plus meters could the top of the sculptures be seen! Compared to them, a person was only a measly fraction!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One sculpture was a young cultivator wielding a sword. It had three heads and six arms. However, what drew one’s attention wasn’t his appearance but the jade chests revolving at the top of his head and his hands. They were radiating treasure light all around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a seal on each jade chest. From those seals, Xu Yangyi could sense a sliver of incredibly familiar Core Formation spiritual pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each chest is personally sealed by Master-Ancestor…” Xu Yangyi inhaled heavily, not leaving immediately to take one. Instead, he looked at the other three statues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One sculpture was a soaring female cultivator. One sculpture was a drunk old man. The last was a young man with a scholar’s appearance. Without exception, all of them carried nine jade chests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nine is counted as the apex?” Xu Yangyi restrained the excitement in his heart and laughed, “Master-Ancestor, it seems that you’re a person who abides by the ancient customs, eh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In any case, his gaze kept on going! Although these jade chests were presently emitting brilliant rays, the radiance within this room didn’t originate from them! Rather… it came from the other end of the bridge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over yonder was an incredibly resplendent treasure light! A treasure light that caused Xu Yangyi to feel his heartbeat stop for a moment as he gazed upon it. A magnificence that concealed everything!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;was the glimmering origin that dazzlingly illuminated the entire treasury!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without any hesitation, Xu Yangyi took a stride forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clear… Following this closing of distance, it became clearer and clearer. In not much time, Xu Yangyi had already taken it into his eye with full clarity. In that place, a two-meter-tall statue of Guanyin was erected! <span id="footnote-ref-4416"><a href="#footnote-4416">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the statue’s side, there was no jade chest floating but rather a gorgeous five-colored stone that was clasped between Guanyin’s hands. It radiated an extremely horrific qi, bobbing up and down in the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” Xu Yangyi stood in front, almost growing drunk on this sensation. Such an incredibly pure qi cleansed him to the point that he nearly moaned. And yet this fist-sized stone was bound to be an extremely mystical treasure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his mind trembled for several seconds, he took a deep breath and collected his gaze. The item that Daomaster Ancientpine wanted him to pick was in no way this item. Otherwise, Xu Yangyi was afraid that he would be slapped when he came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One has to act tactfully.” Xu Yangyi laughed and retrieved his gaze without the slightest reluctance, yet it fell to the floor. He then discovered that someone had used their finger to carve a character in the floor, leaving behind spiritual force. Now sensing Xu Yangyi’s spiritual force, the character responded and radiated purple light like a lamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This item’s name and efficacy is unknown… but it contains a terribly majestic demonic force….” Xu Yangyi read this and raised a brow. He observed the stone in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demonic force? In other words… this… was possibly some demon egg?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It still has not hatched. As for the height of its realm, This Dao Master’s spiritual sense almost collapsed when I probed it. I suspect that it is a Pureblood Demon. I henceforth seal it here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Pureblood Demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi grinned wide, exposing his teeth. Pureblood Demons… had another name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ancient Greater Demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such as Xiaoqing. A 3600-year-old azure carp. Yes, she herself was only an azure carp but through endless cultivation, she had transformed into a Kun Peng! This was the power of an ancient pureblood demon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In ancient times, it was said that even innate souls existed, the theory of a post-celestial soul. There was also the theory of a spirit root and the theory of variation spirit roots. However, now in the End of Days, traces of these concepts had long since vanished. <span id="footnote-ref-b88a"><a href="#footnote-b88a">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t an object that he could control… Xu Yangyi sighed in his heart. Turning his gaze, he turned to the other items. He began looking at the first statue. With a gentle wave of his hand, the first jade chest flew into his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The jade chest was a meter long. The top was sealed all over with symbols. Under Xu Yangyi’s careful observations, he sighed wistfully once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Shadow Manifestation Secret Art…” Xu Yangyi deeply carressed and gently stroked the chest a few times and placed it back. “Ancestor Ancientpine’s prime secret art… To the north and south of the Yangtze River, his martial prowess resonated throughout all of China…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t what he needed. Since he’d chosen the Eternal Alchemy Canon, switching one’s prime arcane effort midway was a cultivator’s great dread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi hesitated over the second chest for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine ability! The Shadowmaker Technique!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All cultivators’ magiks was simply a general term. To divide arcane efforts and divine abilities in detail, an arcane effort was the cultivation foundation, the prime arcane effort. Once confirmed, it was extremely difficult to change. But divine abilities were split into three kinds: offensive, defensive, and supplementary. A complete magik was sure to have many paired divine abilities of a prime arcane effort. For example, Xu Yangyi had always held an extraordinary yearning for the disaster-warding Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Punishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, there were still an even greater amount of paired divine abilities that weren’t divine abilities of a prime arcane effort. It was this reason that greatly stirred his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it.” Gritting his teeth, he put the chest back in its original position in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Punishment’s destructive power is absolute, but it’s a divine ability that's always paired with the Shadow Manifestation Secret Art. Moreover…” He laughed and mumbled, “the Nine Glorious Stars Descent that I have isn’t worse than the Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Punishment in any way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This divine ability could draw forth a worldly anomaly! Although it was unknown if he could fully wield its grandeur in the Qi Condensation realm, such a divine ability wasn’t something Core Formation could possess! Wei Zhongxian had relied on Celestial Master Zhang’s blessing to use it. And who was Celestial Master Zhang?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A contemporary sect master from among the three supreme sects of Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism! If half-immortals existed, then he was a half-immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore… the Heavenly Opening Six Erosions was merely the first move of the Nine Glorious Stars Descent! As he looked at the jade chests, each one caused him to feel a sudden rush of excitement in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw a magik treasure that could be used at initial-stage Foundation Establishment. It was capable of forcibly raising one’s realm by two minor boundaries! It was simply a peerless edge able to jump ranks to slay foes! It was also unknown from where his master-ancestor gained it. In all likelihood, Ancientpine had relied on this to bring his name to such grandness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi also saw a petal. It seemed ordinary, but the explanation on it almost caused him to immediately take it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine Turns Resurrection Flower, capable of obstructing a single death! If nine identical petals were collected… it could restore the qi sea!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi even saw a medicinal pill! A true medicinal pill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… is an Origin Pill!” Studying the numerous and densely packed pill marks, Xu Yangyi exhaled sharply. It was beyond his expectations that Ancestor Ancientpine was actually harboring a medicinal pill! And this medicinal pill was unexpectedly the only jade chest without any explanation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at the pill over and over, wishing each tune that he could take it and run off. Ultimately, he forcibly calmed himself once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This treasury was too precious… If any one of these items were set free, they would smash heads! He couldn’t help but imagine how rich the Tianzi Mountain and Jinshan Temple treasuries that belonged to two eternal greater demons were!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his ruminations, his gaze fell on the final jade chest. With a glance, his gaze suddenly began to scorch. This item… He quickly recalled the meaningful expression that Ancestor Ancientpine had made back then for him to “carefully choose”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s you…” Xu Yangyi inhaled deeply. Without a moment’s hesitation, he deposited the jade chest into his storage ring. “This… is the great gift that Master-Ancestor prepared for me!”</span></p>

If you’ve read a decent amount of xianxia novels at this point, you should be familiar with it as the “Houtian Realm”. The idea of Xiantian to Houtian (pre-celestial to post-celestial) in classical Daoist alchemy is a state of change, Yang to Yin. As indicative of the terms Xiantian to Houtian, before and after the cosmos within one’s body. <a href="#footnote-ref-b88a"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
