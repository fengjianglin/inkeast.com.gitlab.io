This allure was too great. Xu Yangyi’s heart was also incredibly stirred. This spirit stone even transcended Daomaster Jadewave’s origin crystal that he had taken along! At the very least, it was on the same level! And that wasn’t to mention… that another kind of legendary thing could possibly be created if he gained a supreme-grade spirit stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A supreme-grade Spirit Focusing Formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What he still used now was a high-grade Spirit Focusing Formation. Above high grade was super grade, and above super was supreme! If a supreme-grade Spirit Focusing Formation was activated in a nest of qi such as Nanzhou… the result simply couldn’t dared be imagined!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are we going to attack?” Eyes reddened, Chu Zhaonan looked at him. “Each party gets five years to use it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the demon slayer’s mind, heaven and man waged war. After a couple seconds… Xu Yangyi shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t.” He gritted his teeth, and cast away his heart’s desire. “Those capable of using a supreme-grade spirit stone to set down a formation can be counted on one’s fingers, in China. Regardless of what the goal is in creating this formation here, taking it will be equal to throwing a wrench into whoever’s overall arrangement this is if we take the stone and leave. Everyone…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He eyed his fellow cultivators, and spoke no further. However, these words caused all their thoughts and feelings to cool down. Although treasures were good, one needed sufficient destiny to enjoy them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, in making such a massive formation, the plan afoot was absolutely not minor. If a loophole appeared in this mystery cultivator’s arrangements because of them, they would be left with nothing but a path to death so that preventative measures could be taken in advance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet at this time, a cultivator suddenly flew away with a boom, sent back at great speed! It seemed he had been directly slammed by a gigantic palm! His eyes were open wide like copper bells, an incredulous expression coloring his face. On his forehead, there was a bloody cavity the size of a bullet hole. He hadn’t even screamed. The only thing left in the air was an eye-piercing trace of blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Defend!” Chu Zhaonan’s gaze tightened. That cultivator was a new recruit of the Hidden Dragon Legion, at the peak of initial-stage Qi Condensation! Unexpectedly, he had been slammed away without the slightest hair of awareness! With a hole in his forehead, the recruit’s soul had scattered, and his spiritual sense extinguished; he couldn’t be any deader!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… not waiting on Chu Zhaonan to finish shouting, another two cultivators screamed miserably in quick succession. Very soon, they were like ducks being held by the neck, and their cries faded away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It was like an invisible goliath was firing off a bullet divine-ability in the cave. The deceased all had a hole on their forehead, and were sent flying back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi said nothing. His senses were keener than everyone else’s. Moments ago, he had saw a jade-green object moving at a nearly inexplicable speed! It was roughly just the size of an infant’s fingernail, and yet it forcibly swatted away a hundred-kilogram cultivator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His spiritual sense was already in full swing. In the surroundings, countless magik artifacts hovered, each person guarding against this invisible reaper with a frightened look in their eyes. Only he hadn’t moved yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One second, two seconds… On the third second, his eyes flashed open, and Xu Yangyi yelled for everyone to dodge. Without a moment’s delay, he dashed forward! At the same instant of his charge, ribbons of qi swirled around his left arm, and the enormous never-revealed shield form of the Ketu-Rahu Sword rumbled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shield!” Three dots of light soon radiated cold qi on his left arm. In a twinkling, a soft tremor of bangs echoed, and a shield of red qi, that had a radius of five meters, sprung to life in front of him. The face of a beast was carved on the shield, and endless qi ascended into the air. The demon slayer’s gaze stared dead ahead of the shield! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something… Something extremely small raced towards him at simply unfathomable speeds! Even the surrounding air grew fuzzy as the object wildly charged him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sparkling and translucent, pure and limpid, and jade-green in color. Time seemed to freeze in this transient moment. The shape of a water drop emerged in his eyes, and he was hit by what seemed to be a 10,000-catty heavy hammer in the next second! In his somewhat astounded gaze, the droplet flew over ten meters, straight at him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he was about to slam into a wall, talismans glimmered and forcibly dissolved the awful power. He back-flipped and landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this instant of silence, a green water droplet quietly slid down Xu Yangyi’s shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The droplet fell to the floor, but what answered was not the mute sound of dripping water. On the contrary, it was like the rumbling of an immense boulder! A heavy boom rang out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A drop… of water?” Everyone was in a state of disbelief. Simply a drop of water, a mere drop of water was actually over ten thousand catties in weight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was actually water that was killing them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Zhaonan seemed to recall something, a wisp of shock revealed in his eyes. However… he had no time for shock! As this unseen reaper displayed its true colors… a giant orb of water noiselessly rose up from the lakewater!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It couldn’t be considered too large, roughly over a dozen meters in size. Countless pearls of water slid down from the water ball and sunk into the lakebed below, falling down like strange hailstones! The chaotic sound of rumbling echoed ceaselessly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who am I… Who am I?” A mumbling voice grew louder and louder from the lakewater. It wiggled without pause, and transformed into all kinds of humans and creatures. From the lakewater, they formed and then vanished. As the lakewater demon repeated these words over and over, its voice kept on intensifying, and the orb of water’s fluctuations also became more frenzied!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No good…” Xu Yangyi gasped coldly, and turned back and shouted, “Set formation!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One water drop’s power was as heavy as a mountain range!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the entire lake exploded! Not in parts, but as droplets! Like a celestial maiden scattering flowers, infinite bullets were fired! It was a 360-degree attack that left no gap in coverage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Yeyu responded the fastest. At the same time Xu Yangyi shouted, a pitch-black wooden wall rumbled into existence in front of everyone. Soon, Chu Zhaonan set both of his hands on wall without the slightest hesitation and poured spiritual force in!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A crash rang out just as the wall was erected. Xu Yangyi was without a second word, his screaming no idle prattle. Both of his hands thrust forward, and spiritual force freely rushed into the wall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A drop of water could forcibly send him flying away! Slightly worse cultivators would be immediately struck dead! Against such an omnidirectional attack… perhaps no one would survive if there was a minor error with defense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A muffled sound boomed. Mo Yeyu’s mouth quickly opened wide, and he stared at his wall, incredulously! They… had actually been hammered back by a meter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you still looking at?!” Lord Zhao turned back and snarled, “Are you looking to die?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before his voice even fell, both of his hands immediately pushed forward, and the other cultivators were quick to follow in regaining their wits. One pair of hands, two pairs of hands, ten pairs… In the blink of an eye, dozens of hands were all pushed up against the wall! The radiance of the black talismans on the wall shortly began to flash in bursts! A light screen of oily black was surprisingly cast in the middle of pure-blue world around them!</span></p>

Under the illumination of the shining blue talismans, each gentle-looking drop of water seemingly transformed into murderous blades glimmering with light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An exiled immortal summoned, fountain water sprinkling on his face; the oceanic home of mermaids overturned to torrent out with fine jade! <span id="footnote-ref-15b6"><a href="#footnote-15b6">[1]</a></span></span></p>

As the eye of the formation, he was the first to feel the immense shock within his body! His qi sea was unsteady, and he fiercely spat out a mouthful of blood! And yet, he dared not retreat! As the eye of the formation, everyone would be filled with holes like a hornet’s nest if he fell back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The sound of unbroken strikes was heard from the wall. Each noise was like lightning deafening the ears! It was unlike drops of water hitting mark, but more like a legion of titans hammering against a door! Following the spread of this immense force, a cultivator wailed miserably, and a crisp noise echoed from both of his hands. He flew back and slammed into the cave wall with a crack, unknown whether or not he was dead or alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn!” Chu Zhaonan’s eyes were flushed somewhat red. This water… was not normal! It absolutely wasn’t normal! In his mind, another legendary name had already flickered through! That had to be it, only such an object of legend could use and manipulate a supreme-grade spirit stone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, now wasn’t the time to think of these things! With several hundred meters worth of lake water, how long would this horrific spray last? The gunslinger dared not continue with this thought, and he suddenly drove his hand towards his chest. A necklace quickly flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The necklace was a string of wooden beads. In the instant he tossed it out, boundless treasure light erupted. White rays of twilight covered the front of the wall, like another shield. Finally, the pressure lessened by a bit.</span></p>

They seemed to shake, but from beginning to end on this tightrope they hadn’t fallen apart under the wild attack of the water-demon’s infinite jade-green tempest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom boom boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The sounds continued for no less than two to three minutes. Behind the wall, an untold number of cultivators had been jolted away. In less than five minutes… only a few shy of twenty actually remained behind the wall!</span></p>

Both of his hands trembled, wanting to return, yet he discovered that they were glued to the wall. He trembled because he wasn’t sure whether he could take his hands away. The other cultivators were exactly like him as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Proceed.” Xu Yangyi looked over the wall. Everyone’s faces were ashen, a curtain of cold dripping sweat. Xu Yangyi waved, and dozens of pill elixir bottles flew out, making their way towards everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They watched the bottles come flying as usual, and each person opened their hands, catching a pill elixir. But at this moment, the wall in front of them thundered loudly and broke apart into countless black wooden blocks!</span></p>

Branchmaster Xu, you truly are willing to part with something like this…” With trepidation in his heart, Lord Zhao twisted the bottle cap, and his gaze brightened. But just as he was about to take a swig, his eyes jerked over to the scene before him, and he coldly gasped. From head to toe, he trembled uncontrollably and gazed unblinkingly behind Xu Yangyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi’s eyes flashed, and he immediately turned his head back.</span></p>

In the same vein, the stone radiated a blinding light. Both sides were polar opposites, yet they seemed as great a match as life and death!</span></p>
