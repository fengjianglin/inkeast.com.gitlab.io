To use nothing to form something, the vessel must be void… The Flame Records were not written with futility and to broaden on Change will illuminate them. The lunar crescent bore on her back is the cauldron on the furnace, while the White Tiger simmers at the core pivot. The mercurial sun becomes the shifting pearl, the Azure Dragon in accompaniment. Rising east to merge at the west, the Hun and the Po mutually sustain each other. The upward bow at Dui counted eight and the downward bow at Gen also eight; the two bows are united in essence, forming whole the body of Qian and Kun. Eight ounces on eight ounces to beget a pound.

Xu Yangyi’s eyes trembled twice, yet they didn’t open. Nevertheless, an awesome surging tide rose within his heart! THIS, this was an alchemy technique!</span></p>

Not the production of medicines! Not the concoction of pill elixirs! In the modern era, the secret arts of pill refining had long vanished. Not for anything else, in China’s history, there was a rather obscure, yet incapable of being extinguished, fact—in every dynasty, there were at least two or three emperors who died to the art of “immortal pills”. <span id="footnote-ref-6fe0"><a href="#footnote-6fe0">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the cultivation world fused with human society, the Dao of Pills ultimately welcomed its collapse after the Qing dynasty. With the eruption of World War II, everyone realized that what was capable of saving people wasn’t immortal pills, but rather drugs and medicines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cultivation world’s dependence on the human world signaled the collapse of their understanding towards the Dao of Pills. So great was this influence that it spread to a majority of the cultivation Dao heritages. In a span of nearly two centuries, the total eradication of the Dao of Pills had begun. To the extent that even a decade after the establishment of the People’s Republic it had become completely extinct.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because of this matter of the world war that caused the cultivation world, that had stayed sheltered in their mountains and watched the fires of conflict, to begin to view human society as a central construct, the influence of Earth’s civilizations on the cultivation world. It truly caused immortal sects and Dao heritages to recognize that the ancient age had already passed and a completely new era had arrived. So from the beginning of this time, many immortal sects hidden in the world began to open their grand protective formations and little by little step out from their vast mountains, great rivers, and even the desolate Gobi Desert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Until the present, emperors were the only ones in the past that knew of immortal sects and Dao heritages, yet nowadays, cultivation was taken as the other side that had formed a symbiotic relationship with human society.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was alchemy… True alchemy! Perhaps it was the last alchemy technique on Earth! Although that pertaining to alchemy techniques in China’s history had long become submerged in the long river of the past, there would inevitably be a few phrases passed down. It was by the side-by-side comparison of these texts he immediately understood what the meaning was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The text said the White Tiger belonged to the metal element of the lung, and the metal element of the lung harbored the Po, which was also the origin foundation of simmering the golden core. The heart’s fluid was mercury. It was the multifarious moon that acted as the steadfast furnace. The sun of the heart served as the shifting pearl in accordance to the compatibility of the Azure Dragon and the liver’s Hun. The liver’s Hun belongs to yang and the heart fluid’s primordial essence belongs to yin. In union, they are called the yang soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The sun belongs to fire, and fire returns east to wood, the root from whence it was engendered. The moon holds water, and water returns west to beget the source of metal…” He inhaled deeply, a bit of understanding pouring into the bottom tip of his heart. He almost dared not believe the things spoken of by this arcane effort!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He closed both of his eyes. Silently lighting a cigarette, he calmly took a drag. The concepts from moments ago were too profound. He need to carefully reflect on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arcane efforts were divided into primary arcane efforts and supplementary arcane efforts. A primary arcane effort was a cultivator’s foundation and the supplementary arcane effort could increase a cultivator’s external strength. He had originally believed that with the name of the Eternal Alchemy Canon, this was possibly an alchemy arcane effort. In regards to the technique in itself, it didn’t have any benefits, however, after carefully pondering it, he then knew that he was wrong, wrong beyond all reason!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t so simple as a supplementary arcane effort! It was an alchemy technique! However, it was actually an alchemy technique that nobody had ever trained! One that used the body as furnace and cauldron! It would refine the whole body from east to west, heart and soul, a primary arcane effort of the flesh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would use a cultivator’s body to bring forth a natural primordial pill. The body would serve as the furnace and the Hun would act as the vessel, while the mind would be an assisting force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pill concoction required the assistance of the Five Elements. According to this arcane effort, it was tantamount to using the Five Elements to torture the body day and night! It was unknown what level of tyranny the physical body of a cultivator who was “refined” as such would reach! Moreover, it was unknown as to how high of a degree one’s resistance against the Five Elements would become!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To make an analogy, it was like a human tank in a video game that had finally trained up to “resistance level 999” added on with “magic immunity”!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could ask how the Eternal Alchemy Canon had completely changed into something like the Burning Heavens Revelation. However, he was equal to the first forerunner of the Eternal Alchemy Canon in this era. To be trained or not trained, everything was decided, and he had to assume responsibility over the aftermath!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But it really is suited for me. It’s like it was made and developed for me…” Taking a deep drag, he puffed out smoke that wafted through the air. He mumbled, “I myself am an attack damage-type with a fondness for close-quarters combat, rather than an attack damage carry-type that hides behind people…” <span id="footnote-ref-cd0f"><a href="#footnote-cd0f">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An anti-magic body with max resistances was simply measured and created for his style! His cigarette not yet finished, he calmly placed it in front of where he was seated in meditation, sticking it into the ground. Closing his eyes once more, he entered meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great profit was bound to have great danger. But in the world, there was no possibility of obtaining something without putting in hard work.</span></p>

Outside the basement, Zhou Tingting had brought food a couple times. She hesitated for a long time, but didn’t knock on the door. Even if her cultivation wasn’t high, she knew that disturbing one’s seclusion was a cultivator’s taboo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s been in there for three days now…” She looked at the calendar placed on the door and pursed her lips. “H-He seems to also be initial-stage Qi Condensation, right? How can he be fine if he doesn’t eat or drink?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one answered her. There was only the tightly-closed basement door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five days passed, eight days passed, fifteen days passed, and twenty days passed… yet the basement door still hadn’t opened. If other Qi Condensation cultivators were swapped in, perhaps some would even starve to death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, within the basement, not only was Xu Yangyi’s appearance not frail, but the third time he opened his eyes, his gaze was fiery as he sat quietly in his original position.</span></p>

However, this arcane effort didn’t even follow the Cycle of Heaven and Earth!</span></p>

 <div id="footnote-39c4">
  <p>1. There is so much to explain here. The Azure Dragon and the White Tiger are two of four important symbols to Chinese astrology. In a chinese star map, the east is considered the Azure Dragon. West is the White Tiger. North is the Black Tortoise and south is the Vermilion Bird. Longhu Mountain is a real mountain. Said to be where Zhang Daoling founded his immortal sects. The terms Dui, Gen, Qian, and Kun refer to the Eight Trigrams (bagua), an important context in daoist cosmology on the concepts of reality. If you take anything away from all these Daoism notes I’m doing, just keep in mind that Daoism is a system of connections and united thought that somehow manage to combine all together. <a href="#footnote-ref-39c4"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-6fe0">
  <p>2. Traditionally, most ancient “alchemists” who concocted immortality pills used mercury as the basis, which is poisonous in high quantities. One emperor who died to a mercury elixir is the first emperor who unified China, Qin Shi Huang. In fact, mercury was used by ALL ancient Chinese at one point to preserve food. We can imagine how long their lifespans lasted… <a href="#footnote-ref-6fe0"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-cd0f">
  <p>3. Attack Damage-type/Attack Damage Carry-type. In the original chinese, it’s labeled as AD and ADC, both slangs. Makes sense if you know it, but I changed it so that it’s more apparent for everyone. To be honest, I have no clue as to what these things are, but from my research, these terms are used in League of Legends to describe the scaling normal-type attack of heroes. AD refers to more melee and ADC refers to ranged attackers. <a href="#footnote-ref-cd0f"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-de88">
  <p>4. 南明离火 - actual text here literally translates to “South Luminous Beast Fire”. If you look above at the beasts explanation that I wrote out, you’ll recall that the south position is taken by the Vermilion Bird. <a href="#footnote-ref-de88"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-9132">
  <p>5. Five Pecks of Rice School was a real sect/school founded by Zhang Daoling who has been previously mentioned. Zhang Daoling started this school, saying it was the command of Laozi to rid the world of evils and decadence. This school was called Five Pecks of Rice because one needed to donate five pecks of rice (one peck is considered 2 dry gallons) to be accepted. Alternative names for this school include Way of The Celestial Masters. <a href="#footnote-ref-9132"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-af5c">
  <p>6. These are all real sects for the most part. Not going to get to deep into them. One thing I do want to point out though is the Sanfeng sect. You may remember a character from the earlier chapters name Luo Sanfeng. The “Sanfeng” part is the name of an actual famous Daoist named Zhang Sanfeng. <a href="#footnote-ref-af5c"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-b554">
  <p>7. Text says half-immortal, which is also a way of referring to someone with an extremely high position. <a href="#footnote-ref-b554"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

Almost split my head open looking for sources to try to do a good job. I feel like I am dying. Mind you, that entire text from the Eternal Alchemy Canon is REAL and in classical Chinese. Might do a write up later on further explain this stuff, but all you need to know is that this is all Daoist Alchemy mumbo jumbo, but I do want to make clear one thing.</span></p>

In Daoism specifically, there are three Hun and seven Po. These concepts are both souls, Hun is yang and Po is yin. That is why you see in that alchemy text talk of using the Po, because it is yang-natured, which is considered fire.&nbsp;</span></p>
