 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master!” Li Zongyuan was astonished, his mouth teeming with bitterness. “The applicant for this project must be an alchemist! Moreover, there has to be a definite result and project planning! The team size and the project progress! Computer-drafted design graphing and exhaustive data has to be offered to the Pill Cauldron Corporation for investigation, and each newcomer’s project aid represents several tens of thousand to even a million spirit stones! The regional CFOs of the Pill Cauldron Corporation will lead their team to personally estimate…”</span></p>

Xu Yangyi’s following words had completely corked his mouth. Choking on them for a couple seconds, he then laughed self-deprecatingly, “Little me dares not to. I only…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi moved to wave off Li Zongyuan’s closing remarks with his hand. He faintly furrowed his brows. “Don’t call yourself little, and don’t say master, too. It’s unpleasant to listen to; use proper names.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A couple years ago when I was resting, I watched a relaxing anime once in while.” He seemed to think back of a story and gently tapped the table. “There was a toad called Bunta.” <span id="footnote-ref-1cc7"><a href="#footnote-1cc7">[1]</a></span></span></p>

Those from the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion take precedence. Also, bring me back a pill furnace, one of high quality. Go.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi glanced at him, and Gamabunta immediately bowed at the waist, gritting his teeth. “It will be delivered in five hours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zongyuan moved into action quickly. It was the afternoon right now. As night fell, a car had already brought the items back with three additional middle-aged cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhang Gongchang.” A middle-aged cultivator looked at Xu Yangyi who was sitting upright in the middle and immediately recognized that this was his employer. He bowed slightly. “Initial-stage Qi Condensation. I once did the statistics for the Bountiful Treasure Pavilion’s drug ingredients department.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Li Mu. I was once an employee of the CSIB’s planning department. Initial-stage Qi Condensation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wang Chunlai. I’m a retired employee of the CSIB’s computer department. Initial-stage Qi Condensation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi only nodded, his gaze falling on the half-person-tall pill cauldron behind Li Zongyuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pill cauldrons weren’t expensive. Since the technique had already vanished, all of its related components only had a single value and that was collecting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pill cauldron was a four-legged cauldron, the surface carved with profound runes. There were five round holes on the body of the cauldron, split apart into five spirit objects of corresponding attribute. The inside of the cauldron was a thick black shell, however, there was no unusual scent at all. Rather, it emitted a dull medicinal fragrance of over a hundred interweaved medicines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the medicine dregs… Xu Yangyi’s gaze slightly rippled as it swept over the hard black shell. Was it not known where that ancient alchemist was today? To be capable of causing the pill cauldron to emit medicine dregs, his alchemy technique was bound to be a cut above. However, with the past several hundred years and that which had transpired in the last millennium, he had obtained this cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is its name.” He looked at the medicine cauldron and asked indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It has no name.” Li Zongyuan laughed self-deprecatingly, “Mr. Xu, as you will.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi walked over, gently stroking the cauldron. “Then… it will be called ‘Origin’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, and three gives birth to all beings. As all return to the beginning, all things are born anew. You aren’t a three-legged cauldron, and through countless eras, you’ve arrived in my hands. This is also a rebirth of nature.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a flick of his finger, the pill cauldron issued a hum just like that of a dragon’s cry. He nodded his head in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Without my demand, do not come in.” He finished saying these words and picked up the pill cauldron in hand, walking towards the cultivation room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Watching Xu Yangyi walk to the room door, Zhang Gongchang stroked his chin and faced towards Li Zongyuan and laughed, ‘Fellow Daoist, do you not know of what we’re going to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t!” Li Zongyuan’s expression sunk in a flash, his face so ashen that water could be wrung from it. 10 million… His many years of capital and holdings! In a single afternoon, it had been wiped out clean! Moreover, he even had to buy this useless hunk of junk!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without testing the degree the neurons had activated, a system of study, and detailed arrangements, he, Xu Yangyi, actually dared to refine pill elixirs as such!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, all the pill elixir manufacturing tools he was using were all from the most famous cultivation research institute, the Bright Truth Company. All that was required was for a cultivator to throw in the ingredient amount, and the devices would tune it to a hair. There wouldn’t be a loss of the refined pill elixir. The difference in medicinal efficacy could be completely viewed in an alchemist’s two hands, and the neurons could sense how much there was of the drug ingredients. A tenth of a percent more or a tenth of a percent less, there was quite the possibility of two kinds of results!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was already under the situation that alchemy techniques had died out. The pinnacle of what modern cultivators could accomplish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And as for Xu Yangyi?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had zilch! Yet he dared to refine pills in such a manner! Even using a most ancient pill cauldron! Where would the hygiene certification for pill elixirs refined like this be obtained? Who was willing to test the quality?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his wish to escape was uncertain, looking on helplessly at such a waste of his money was practically like a blade cutting apart his heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bunta.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes! Yes! Do you have instruction?” Li Zongyuan’s extreme misgivings of moments ago were thoroughly vanquished at the sound of this voice, the expression on his face piled with a slow smile like it was conjured.</span></p>

Li Zongyuan breathed in deeply a couple times, the pain of dripping blood in his heart dissipating. With both a smile heaped onto his face and clenched teeth, he said awkwardly, “Mr. Xu… seems to be going to refine pill elixir. Your duty is to record the wear and tear of drug ingredients, classification, accuracy to zero-point-something grams, and the time required for failed furnaced pills… please.”</span></p>

The dove faction pays special interest to the development of equality, and the hawk faction cares for hard-line treatment… All of us are part of the dove faction. Since we’ve accepted this work, then it doesn’t master who’s posted it. In any case, we’ve also taken a few hundred grand in cash.”</span></p>

This basement had been separated in two halves. One half was a living room and the other half was a cultivation room. Naturally, this was his exclusive cultivation room.</span></p>

White cat or black cat, a cat that caught a rat was a good cat. The process was of no significance. What was important was the result. It seemed he just didn’t mind things like collaborating with humans or demons. Sitting down on the ground, he closed his eyes, and his mind entered meditation. His spirit condensed in his qi sea, and in a flash the Eternal Alchemy Canon appeared once again in his mind.</span></p>
