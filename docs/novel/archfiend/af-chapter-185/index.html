 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was said that the more awesome a demon form was that the harder it was to achieve Form Transformation, a demonbeast’s strength was at least a third stronger than a human’s. But…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their own side had close to forty people. Against a Great Circle Qi Condensation demonbeast that hadn’t yet reached Form Transformation, they still had the confidence to fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xingtian Legion, get ready…” Xu Yangyi breathed in deeply, and two raging blazes were already roaring in his hands. “I’ll give a drop of the Rootless Nine Bends Aqua to whoever slays the livyatan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whish whish whish!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In the wake of this line, ten majestic rays of qi deafeningly exploded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yao Xintan silently drew out his longblade. At his side, Mo Yeyu’s mantis-shaped puppet quietly appeared. In Qin Xueluan’s surroundings, there was a scarlet snake, yet the crown of its head was white. Even stranger, there were actually two feathery wings around its body. Like a little dragon, the snake coiled around her and circled in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This snake is called the White Featherhead. A single drop of its venom can kill ten whales.” She licked her lips, bearing a wisp of excitement as she looked at the giant demonbeast. “I want to try out… how many bites can you withstand?” <span id="footnote-ref-00ae"><a href="#footnote-00ae">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind Gao Wuguo, qi pearls representing the Five Phases mysteriously appeared. Each pearl emitted an astonishing spiritual force. Quan Ningyue didn’t speak but tightly gripped her hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for this whale-demon, it had evidently detected them already. Its body shrunk, seemingly condensing spiritual force. Afterwards, it fiercely opened its maw and followed with an ear-splitting roar! In front of the crowd, this action resembled the sudden opening of a black door that was over a dozen meters in size! Both sides of the livyatan’s mouth were all ghastly white teeth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With approximately forty people, three or four bites weren’t needed to swallow them all in!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It really reeks, eh…” Yang Xueqing’s hair flew back, and she curled her lips in disgust. Both her hands crossed, and a thunderbolt seal quickly began to shine in her hand. At the same time, her pupils turned completely silver-white. “Five Thunders Hereticism… Thunder Immortal Descends!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom boom boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Thunderbolts emerged in the cave without the slightest warning, however, they all gathered on her person. At this moment, she seemed to transform into a giant lightning rod!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were located in an underwater area! As for thunder and lightning, both were the nemesis of demons. In addition, both of these spearheads were able to exhibit their greatest effect in this location!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crackle crackle crackle…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Rays of lightning all aggregated in her seven apertures. Presently, she resembled a lightning god descending. Even her stretched fingers wielded electric arcs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is one of my killing aces…” She raised her head, using her eyes filled with lightning to glare at the giant beast. “Cover me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this place, she had the confidence to go all out against this demonbeast from millions of years ago that had now awaken again for an unknown reason! Even if this didn’t work, she still had the confidence to serve as this battle’s primary assault!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet the Zhao Clan cultivators were all gaping foolishly! Low-level cultivators were ignorant to the Xingtian Legion’s reputation. But… this woman before their eyes, her strength… was even enough to keep pace with both Fifth and Seventh Uncles in the clan! No, so much that this power surpassed them! The spiritual force radiating from her body right now shockingly surmounted the middle stage of Qi Condensation! It directly pressured the late stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“T-This woman is their most destructive, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maybe! This divine ability… is really too shocking!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck me… This woman is too savage, yeah?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe…” Just as Yang Xueqing’s voice fell, Qin Xueluan’s phoenix eyes opened wide. “It just so happens that I’m fairly confident, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two woman glanced at each other—there were no more words. In the next second, Yang Xueqing raised her left hand, and a ten-meter-wide domain of pure-white lightning instantly encaged the livyatan’s surroundings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jun Man!” Xu Yangyi bellowed without hardly any hesitation. At the same time, with the four impositions of Flying Star, Rapid Shadows, Wind Brandishes Traces, and Life Sacrification, he charged right before the livyatan like an azure phantom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quan Ningyue’s gaze flashed, and the sledgehammer in her hand quickly exploded with red brilliance! A faintly discernible Vermilion Bird wound around it. If said Xu Yangyi’s move was indistinct, her move was unable to be evaded by any means while it was clearly visible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lone force to cleave through myriad methods! Quan Ningyue snarled and likewise chose to make a strong frontal attack! It was similar to a Vermilion Bird’s nirvana, bringing soaring flames to rush above!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, Yao Xintan sucked in deeply. At his back, seven blades oddly floated in his surroundings. Closely following, the seven blades, along with his silhouette, combined into one streak in the air and also charged ahead! Three figures leapt over a dozen meters. As they were halfway through, another inhuman figure dashed forth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Fang Cheng! Already, he had fully demonized! From tail to snout, his wolf form was fused with all-encompassing shadows as his figure was trailed by a piercing howl. The place he opted for was the whale’s hardest part—its forehead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was because… everyone could feel a horrible spiritual pressure radiating behind them! Gao Wuguo’s five qi pearls had united, actually forming a strange black qi pearl with blood-like veins converging on its surface. His expression was somewhat wan, and his veins bulged all over his body. It was like he was using blood to nourish the qi pearl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet at this moment, he was standing in a peculiar puppet, a puppet that seemed to possess an amplification function. Gao Wuguo’s hair stood on edge, and Mo Yeyu was carefully observing his state at the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The duo were exercising their killing moves! All of this was accomplished in nearly a wink, devoid of hardly any communication! All of the Zhao Clan cultivators watching at the side were dumbstruck, eyes wide and mouths empty!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“T-This is a true legion from the Featherwood Guard?” A Zhao Clan cultivator said, staring and tongue-tied. Originally, the Zhao Clan should’ve been making cover, but now they had completely forgotten their own duties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Longsu Province was too far and remote. They were a new of batch specialized Qi Condensation cultivators. Ordinarily, they saw at most the competitions of their senior and junior brothers. A larger competition was the Zhao Clan’s several so-called Grand Clan Martial Assemblies. How was anyone supposed to watch a true legion in action?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore… each person of the Xingtian Legion had been personally chosen by Xu Yangyi! It could be said that every person in comparison to him wouldn’t be too much weaker! If they truly used their aces in reserve, it could even be said that he would also suffer moderate injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, in the eyes of the rookies, the geniuses were practically communicating with glances! Action achieved in a flash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were shocked, but Zhao Wuye was even more astonished! As someone who had personally witnessed Xu Yangyi choosing legionnaires, he hadn’t expected that this legion would instantly transform into a killing machine once they acted!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two people had made killing moves and the rest had provided immediate shielding without a moment’s delay. Moreover… the two women who wanted to act as the primary force before were delighted to act in sync! This was a pairing of true geniuses! All that was sought was victory, disregarding process!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fourth Devilslayer Blade… Spirit Slayer!” A great majority of Qi Condensation cultivators were unable to stay in the air for too long. As he reached the peak of his jump, Yao Xintan attacked without the slightest indecision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An emerald blade-light suddenly loomed in the sky. Slivers of qi seethed, containing infinite killing intent and charging the livyatan that was thirty meters away with great swiftness! As the blade tip was sent forth, the anguished howls of countless slain demons rang out in the air. Dim green ripples mingled on the blade’s edge as it surged forward, invisible to the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The blade collided with the surface of the livyatan’s pitch-black body. With a boom, green fireworks exploded on the giant black figure. An untold number of demons and ghosts wailed and flashed from the impact site!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, the strike had no effect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the water, the livyatan’s massive body was like a titan. The image of this blow appeared dazzling, but the beast’s head hadn’t even leaned to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a strong body!” Presently, Xu Yangyi also stopped at the highest point of his jump. Without a moment’s hesitation, the Ten Cardinals Red Lotus screamed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Water inherently subdued fire, but the Ten Cardinals Red Lotus was different. The fact that it didn’t die out until everything was incinerated was its greatest property. Forthwith, in the sky above the thousand-meter lake, thunder and lightning played company to each other. The expanse below was a sea of scarlet fire! Presently, a scene that could only be read about in fantasy novels had fully revealed itself before everyone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However… the beast still hadn’t moved at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dragon-Snake Dance!” Following a bellow, a scarlet figure passed the thunder light and fire sea and oddly appeared beside the giant whale. It consumed its full strength to bite down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ding!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A crisp sound echoed, stunning Qin Xueluan. She hadn’t expected whatsoever that the livyatan’s skin was actually comparable to a magik treasure! It couldn’t be bitten! This was the problem with demonbeasts. Although their wisdom had yet to blossom, their entire bodies were their magik artifacts! With pure brute force, they were able to crush a same-stage cultivator to death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All three of these moves had failed to bring results! The creature only seemed to have an instinctual fear of Yang Xueqing’s lightning that was caging it, not charging through in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Assemble!” Xu Yangyi decisively changed tactics. On initial contact, the creature actually hadn’t been gashed by a hair!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual sense swiftly twisted around the livyatan’s figure, and he clearly sensed how dense the beast’s muscle was. His spiritual sense falling onto its skin even caused his brain somewhat of a stabbing pain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck!” He fiercely spat. This fellow’s skin marks… surprisingly formed an innate formation! It was no wonder that its resistance towards divine abilities was so dreadfully high!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In particular… he even sensed an extremely ample layer of blubber under its skin, a thickness that was over several meters! It was like a bomb shelter’s super-thick walls! When a divine ability struck the creature’s body, the skill would first be dispelled by the outer skin and then pass through the layer of blubber underneath. Finally, it was able to arrive in the beast’s internal organs and was then scattered by the colossal body, simply ignored and disregarded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lone strike had yielded no result, and everyone immediately fell back to the tortoise puppets. However, they didn’t pant for air but rather looked back! The maneuver just now was simply the Xingtian Legion’s experimental attack. It was only to provide cover for Gao Wuguo and Mo Yeyu’s true killing move! They didn’t even have time to turn around, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Make way!!!” A shout had already erupted from behind! Without even thinking, Xu Yangyi was the first to lie down on the giant tortoise. In an instant, everyone reflexively crouched down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black radiance infused with blood-red lightning! It resembled a sharpened arrow taking flight from its bow from where they were crouched down, containing a courageously advancing might and attacking the giant whale’s forehead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the attack of their true lance! The great killing move they had covered for! No more than ten seconds had just passed. Everything was for this lance to store power to its maximum state!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Wuguo’s two hands slackened as he stood in place. His face was pale, his head dripped with cold sweat, and his fingers trembled erratically. At his side was an already scrapped puppet, and Mo Yeyu, whose complexion was equally pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">SWOOSH!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wherever this black light passed, the lakewater was completely parted by over two meters of depth! Waves madly threw themselves away at both sides! It was like the Staff of Moses, a single staff put forth and myriad waters fled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless green pearls and jades seemed to rise upwards in the sky. Under the reflection of sunlight, brilliant light flowed and vibrant hues brimmed.</span></p>
