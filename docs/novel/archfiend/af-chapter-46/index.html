I’ve heard that when their ancestor still came out, he was a cultivator at the Great Circle of Foundation Establishment… The Wang Clan’s three talismans. One to save one’s life, one to evade assault, and one to attack… Others could take out a high-grade spirit stone, but not obtain a talisman. I’ve heard that only close acquaintances can get one… and now he’s actually said that they’re all open…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s because they only have this opportunity to act.” At his side, a leader from a small clan sighed. “In comparison to the CSIB, Featherwood Guard, and Bountiful Treasures Pavilion, this is the only chance they have to make a bid. They hope to inflame Fellow Daoist Xu’s heart so that he signs right on the spot. Maybe he won’t sign with anyone here. They’ll make secret contact to get a chance. Ugh, this sure is a mess…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But… how could the Big Three possibly let Fellow Daoist Xu sign right here?” The clan master that had spoken before shook his head and sighed, “Things looks intense. The true buyers are those three powers, huh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You heard the conditions that the CSIB came out with first… A Wealth Repossession Captain, the Nine National Offices… If Fellow Daoist Xu finds any ancient remnants, he can mobilize at once. Mooncrescent Gold, Fireblaze Ruby, and Myriadlight Stone, which one of these isn’t a famous refining material worth a thousand catties of gold? A medium-scale mine… All Fellow Daoist Xu has to do is nod and it could even be said he’ll be able to call wind and rain later on. This treading of waters is the stabilizing force of those three clans.” <span id="footnote-ref-993e"><a href="#footnote-993e">[1]</a></span></span></p>

His qi sea was as empty as the void. Not a speck of qi existed within his entire body. Against Chu Zhaonan’s final strike of two bullets, the glimmer of gold and the still moon submerged in jade, he had defended against one shot with all his strength, but the other one had drilled into his chest like a viper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it wasn’t life threatening, it rendered him unable to use his spiritual force! Even if he absorbed more, the qi he had just tried to assimilate simply wouldn’t stay in his qi sea!</span></p>

All activity outside entered his ears, yet he carried a faint mocking smirk at the crook of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Burning Heavens Revelation… He had never heard of it, but from the hardly undisguised reactions of the people outside and Moonchaser’s meticulous introduction, he knew that this was a supreme arcane effort that led directly to the Grand Dao of Core Formation. Something that was yearned for in dreams!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… am I, Xu Yangyi, worth just this insignificant arcane effort?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

In kind, he held an extreme thirst for it. But...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood in his heart was boiling, and he licked his cracked, bloodstained lips, laughing coldly, “It’s a pity that you all forgot about my original desire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine if I don’t join this kind of immortal sect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If these words were set free to the outside world, it was unknown how many people would beat their chests and stomp their feet, a mystery as to how many would curse him as foolish. Cultivation was the struggle of all living things. Among the ten Core Formation Grand Daos, even Foundation Establishment cultivators would topple over for one that could open a crack in the door, but Xu Yangyi actually said that it was fine not to join?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi still didn’t have any experience walking through the true cultivation world. He was basically clueless… of how heavy this Core Formation arcane effort’s position was when placed outside! It was unpleasant to hear, but it wasn’t an exaggeration that this art would incite a massacre that would overflow the heavens in blood!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only knew that he was looking forward to and fantasizing about the graduation. This because only that way he would be able to track down the murderer that Heavens Law couldn’t find in broad seas and boundless skies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had waited to execute his thirteen-year plan for the shadow that had streaked through his nightmares countless of times! He could laugh and recount of his mother and father’s great enmity, but by no means could he laugh and relinquish it! He could laugh and speak about it to Chief Zheng because it was the brand at the bottom of his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why had he entered Heavens Law? Why had he said those words to Chu Zhaonan, in his sorrow? His heart faintly ached, and he seemed to return to that time in the past when he was eight years old, clearly looking at two faces that already appeared fuzzy yet were crystal clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Arcane efforts are secondary.” He shut his eyes and emotionlessly sensed qi cleansing his flesh. Nonetheless, it was staunch in not filling his qi sea. Qi seemed to choke in his chest where the bullet was located, dissipating with a rumble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spirit stones are secondary. Resources, magik artifacts… these things are all secondary!” His two fists on his knees slightly clenched, yet his voice was flat without disturbance like a cicada wing in the air. “If a cultivator cannot be firm in their own heart, why cultivate? Why oppose the heavens?” His unresolved revenge on his mortal foe had twisted him as a child. “Don’t tell me that none of you can see what I really want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you think I’ll come running over like a rabid dog for an arcane effort? And grovel beneath Daomaster Floatingcloud?” A faint sneer perked up at the crook of his mouth. “Naive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I, Xu Yangyi, am a man of true grit and untamed spirit. I am not so cheap.” He said nothing more. He continued to listen to the conversations outside. Of the various falling flowers, there would inevitably be one that suited him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ruo River was 3,000 miles long, but only a single ladle could be drank from it. Even if this ladle wasn’t the Big Three, but merely a cultivation clan. <span id="footnote-ref-9bcb"><a href="#footnote-9bcb">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the qi walls, Firecloud was currently in a dour mood. As a lone cultivator that had made his way into the world, his legacies couldn’t compare to the generousness of the clans. Right here, right now, the show had already reached a burning-white climax. The clans stood up one by one and took out their hidden aces. Even their conditions made the eyes of several Foundation Establishment cultivators turn green in envy. He had secretly sealed off the qi walls, leaving the two people inside to their actions, but it seemed to have become a joke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What did it matter whether or not they came out?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In any case, it wasn’t his turn. Not even to compare his bargaining piece to the CSIB’s marvelous conditions, his Good Fortune arcane effort didn’t hold any advantage even lined up with the famous cultivation clans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But compared to his expression, Moonchaser’s was even more unsightly. It was far beyond Moonchaser’s calculations that he, who was enthralled by cultivation, had screwed up in his good intentions. The chess piece that Daomaster Floatingcloud had arranged in passing had actually been messed up by his own disciple!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“An A-rank demon core.” At this time, a voice suddenly echoed. “And an additional A-rank Foundation Establishment magik treasure.” At long last, Shadowslay was no longer able to control himself from speaking. How deep did a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s qi have to be to suppress the voices of everyone present just by speaking?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only the demon core of a demon that hasn’t even reached Core Formation. What is it? A-rank? Late-stage Foundation Establishment?” Firecloud gritted his teeth. “You’re truly willing to part with it?! The foundation between you and I has already been set; what use is there in wanting the Burning Heavens Revelation?! Don’t tell me you’ve hardened your heart to wash your meridians and rake your marrow?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re totally capable of asking the branch upstairs to take a look if he has some other interests! It’s not necessary to come down with such an exorbitant sum!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is his down payment.” Shadowslay looked motionlessly at the billowing qi walls. “It’s not for the arcane effort. It’s only for he himself.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m aware my down payment doesn’t even compare to the clans of many Foundation Establishment cultivator. However, this is my approach.” His gaze twinkled. “Fellow Daoist Firecloud, you and I haven’t known each other for no short time. How many people here do you believe are making moves just for that Core Formation arcane effort?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Firecloud was stunned, and Shadowslay said indifferently, “No… Not many. For a famous scholar to be bequeathed with a treasure sword, for a person with not enough comprehension or talent to obtain this arcane effort, it is only a reckless waste.” He looked quietly at the boiling crowd and said lowly, “Are they setting down such capital earned with their blood and sweat just to waste it fruitlessly?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After several seconds of silence, Firecloud waved his hand disappointedly. “Indeed… they dare not to haphazardly cultivate a Core Formation cultivator's arcane effort. Otherwise, it would be nought but a path to ruin… You wish to sow good karma? Even if we’re already unable to accept him as a disciple?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shadowslay faintly nodded, his voice chopping through nails and slicing apart iron. “In a couple decades, as long as this child doesn’t die on the bramble-covered path of cultivation, he’ll surely be included on the list of Foundation Establishment cultivators.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore…” Shadowslay sighed. “the branch’s communication equipment has sparked out. You think I haven’t asked young friend Xu because I have some other interest? The comms upstairs have been cut off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Firecloud sucked in deeply. Very soon, the situation would become increasingly chaotic. Under the circumstances of his own chance ever shrinking, he said clearly, “The Good Fortune art can enhance a bottle of ten-year-refined Spirit Accumulating Elixir.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an item with two variants that when ordinarily taken out would undoubtedly cause Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation cultivators to scramble over it. But now, as each family came out with conditions so generous that the eyes of others went red, it wasn’t much to look at. The sole eye-catching aspect about it was probably that it had come from a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</span></p>

Whether or not it should be said, it’s good to consider it clearly.”</span></p>

According to the present conditions, the bids of the several Foundation Establishment cultivators were on the contrary the lowest! He would have to look on helplessly as these two great seedlings cupped hands to others, while one of them was even attached with an arcane effort that led straight to a Core Formation Grand Dao! How could he wish for such pain in his heart?!</span></p>

Through the instructions of the regional president of the three western provinces, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion is willing to sign Fellow Daoist Xu for a hundred years with a signing bonus of 10 billion USD!
