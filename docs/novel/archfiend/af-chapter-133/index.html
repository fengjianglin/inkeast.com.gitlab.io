 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Zhaonan didn’t say a second word. He got up and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be like this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Sanfeng and Gao Ye were more or less embarrassed. Were they leaving? Or not leaving?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve disappointed me very much.” Chu Zhaonan walked two steps and turned his head to look at Xu Yangyi, simply uncaring of where he was. He gritted his teeth and said, “Xu, if you’re gonna fucking say you ain’t got a thing, speak up earlier! I could’ve figured something out for you! We both crossed through death. Are you returning my embarrassment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi looked at Chu Zhaonan. The gunslinger was so honest that it was cute. He laughed; how was it that he hadn’t discovered that Chu Zhaonan had this side to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you consider me a brother? This isn’t a damn Legion Inauguration Ceremony! If you said the word, my father would’ve asked my grandfather to advocate for you! Those pack of clowns downstairs are stiffs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But you didn’t say a fucking thing! Now…” Chu Zhaonan really did want to curse, but in the end he rigidly clenched his teeth. “Do as you see fit!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other present attendees couldn’t not recognize Chu Zhaonan. He was the young lord of Mingshui Province and moreover a cultivator. With such a reputation, he couldn’t make too much noise. The old man of the Yi Clan laughed wryly, “Even young Chu had a few good words to say. We can only blame ourselves for failing in familiar waters. We chased a wild goose only to get pecked in the eye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vulture and Lilac were silent, smiling bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if they wanted to somehow justify going back, they didn’t throw away the substance of today’s face altogether. To a newly established legion, this was a fatal blow. It was out of norm for Xu Yangyi to be absent-minded. To think of doing something like this… could even be considered folly! As old friends in times past, they could provide aid for a few things, but some matters couldn’t be helped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Zhaonan shook his head, turning around and leaving. At the very least, he was still able to somewhat come to the rescue. He walked away dispiritedly, and his thoughts were a tad discouraged. How? How could the opponent he acknowledged, missing for three years, do such a thing after two years of seclusion?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind, the sound of something opening echoed. Afterwards, a person stood up. Very soon… a second person stood up. And then a third, and a fourth...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the direction he was leaving, Chu Zhaonan could see behind because there were so very few people present. There simply wouldn’t be people sitting in the back, but right now there was still one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thousandedge’s third secretary. Yet at this moment, she also stood up. Not only had she stood up, Chu Zhaonan discovered to his shock that her entire body was shaking. Her mouth was gaping wide as if she’d seen a ghost. The current mood was far too calm. So calm that there was an odd trace to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The light of Chu Zhaonan’s eyes wavered, and his head snapped back without the slightest hesitation! Behind… everyone was already standing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black object was suspended above Xu Yangyi’s palm. As for Xu Yangyi at this very instant, he seemed to be god seizing the Earth! In this place, time ceased. There weren’t many people here, but each one of them had their eyes glued onto the black pellet over yonder, unable to shift away at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This item wasn’t shining or dazzling, but the object of this moment seemed to burn as magnificently as the origin crystal of a thousand-year-old demon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is…” Old Yi’s expression was sluggish. He was close enough that a faintly discernible medicinal aroma clearly wafted into his nostrils. These two words seemed to exhaust his mental and physical strength, and the voice that left his mouth was wavering. The timbre of it was trembling dreadfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daofather above…” The present posture of the Thousand Domains Residence’s young cultivator was rather strange. On his chair, he was half-standing and half-sitting, his entire body weight supported on both his hands that were grasping the armrests. As for his hands propped on the armrests… they were shaking fiercely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vulture and Lilac had also stood up. They looked at the object in Xu Yangyi’s hand in disbelief, their eyes swiftly flushing red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A medicinal pill! This was a medicinal pill! These two words were akin to a thunderclap sparking through everyone’s minds, no longer able to be omitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is impossible… Impossible!!!” It wasn’t known after how long, but a mournful screech rang out from the last row of seats. From head to toe, Thousandedge’s third secretary shook like sifting chaff. She embraced her bosom and cried out pointedly, “H-How is this possible?! How could such a thing exist?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had paid any mind to the auction. Wasn’t the auction of a Qi Condensation cultivator hilarious? And yet… at this moment, they suddenly discovered that the auction of a Qi Condensation cultivator could similarly have an item that defied the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A swoosh rang out amidst the deathly silence. Xu Yangyi made a pinching motion with his hand, and the black medicinal pill vanished without a trace. He laughed, “Thanks to the favor of a good friend, I’ll be auctioning a bottle of Spirit Strengthening Pills in the auction next month. The amount isn’t set, but it won’t be over twenty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, no one said anything, but a layer of clarity had already suffused on the surface of everyone’s eyes. It was as if they’d just awakened from a dream. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to speak, but in this sudden instant, the ability of speech had become lost to them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A medicinal pill… Concerning the time period for quality assurance, from what modern excavation had yielded, a Core Formation pill’s rough preservation period exceeded no more than two centuries. A Qi Condensation medicinal pill didn’t surpass thirty years! That was to say...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thought sent everyone’s hearts into wild palpitations! This… was a recently concocted medicinal pill! The Dao of Pills… had been recreated!!! After a separation of 200 years, the Dao of Pills had revealed itself once more before the world’s people!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The room was filled with a deathly silence, so quiet that one could even hear the sound of pounding hearts. Xu Yangyi’s brows coolly furrowed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s not right… How could you all be so tongue-tied? You guys have to state something. My auction’s still looking forward to your hype. Can’t you say something?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When the time comes, I’ll have to ask everyone…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“OUR BOUNTIFUL TREASURES PAVILION IS IN!!!” Before Xu Yangyi’s voice fell, a voice far surpassing the third secretary’s loud screech jolted the room into tremors. Here and now, Vulture’s eyes were bloodshot. His words in this moment seemed to drive into action some switch. “No one fight me on this! 500 spirit stones… No! A thousand medium-grade spirit stones for a single pill! Who dares to come?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no way Vulture couldn’t be anxious! The Bountiful Treasures Pavilion had no commanding Core Formation ancestor. They were the masters operating the crafts of talismans, pill elixirs, and magik artifacts. The differences of the rest weren’t an issue, and their grand masters were all basically stationed at the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion. But as for Pill Dao...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been extinct for close to 200 years! With its present emergence, there would inevitably be a complete reform of the cultivation world’s pill elixir system in several years! How could Vulture not be worried?! In what way could he not be anxious?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Thousand Domains Residence will sponsor the Xingtian Legion with fifty supreme-grade estates! We won’t take a single cent of expense!!!” Just as Vulture’s voice fell, the Thousand Domains Residence’s youth shouted even louder than him! In passing, he took out a jade card. “Fellow Daoist… No! Commander Xu! This is the Thousand Domains Residence’s Thousand Domains travel pass! With this pass, you can choose whatever fifty supreme-grade estates you fancy within all of China! They’re included with pre-installed high-grade Spirit Focusing Formations!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth’s breathing was labored like an ox, and he only felt numbing waves on his scalp. A medicinal pill… This was the Dao of Pills! He dared to be certain! If the chairman was here right now, he would definitely use every fiber of his being to aid him wrest this medicinal pill, as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These medicinal pills in themselves were only Spirit Strengthening Pills! But what was important… was researching their compositions! They had the possibility of obtaining the pill concoction sequence! The methodology!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Merely this “possibility” warranted the grand die toss of at least 40,000 medium-grade spirit stones! The youth didn’t regret it one bit! This wealth… in comparison to the reappearance of the Dao of Pills after close to two centuries… What was there to consider?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Dao of Pills could be recovered… No! A collaboration! A collaboration in this industry! This pittance of money would be a single hair from nine oxen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not having yet opened his mouth to shout a price, an attendant was no longer able to contain himself from yelling. In this situation, people were still waiting to speak? What a joke!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The CSIB!” Just as Lilac was about to speak, she suddenly drew a blank. This scenario… was very familiar… It was similar to the one five years ago and still the same person. Merely, the buyers weren’t the same and neither was the venue…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, it didn’t matter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The CSIB is willing to pay any price! Fellow Daoist Xu! Speak! As long as you say the word!!! Our specialists and R&amp;D teams at the CSIB are the best in the entire nation! Pill formulas?! Relax! Speak! Just say the word! What do you desire?! We’ll give it! Foundation Establishment pill? Core Formation pill?! Nascent Soul pill?! So long as you speak! Just say it! We’ll immediately open registration rights!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Core Formation pill! Nascent Soul pill! These words, even though they were only pill formulas which were silent for close to two centuries, were likewise unable to be more shocking! None had expected that the CSIB actually held such a precious pill formula in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha!” Vulture’s gaze flashed, and he said without hardly any delay, “Lilac, don’t take out that rubbish to scare people off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Dao of Pills! Do you know what this represents?! If someone requires a pill formula, even a Core Formation ancestor wouldn’t necessarily be able to relax by a finger’s gap!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then are you planning on chatting with our Ancestor Hiddenscent?!” Lilac slapped a table and stood up, revealing no weakness at all. “I dare vow! Fellow Daoist Xu! As long as you speak, the few collection of pill formulas in Ancestor Hiddenscent’s hands are in no way off limits! And I also guarantee! The odds are at least over 70%!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vulture and Lilac glowered at each other, yet both of them were astounded. This situation of mutual undermining… How could it be so familiar…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how could it be only 70%? The only pill master in the End of Days! The world’s pill magiks… were his! Unless… someone still wished to continue using pill elixirs! Or use capsules!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shiver traveled down Old Yi’s body, his mouth opening a few times, yet because of his racing pulse, words didn’t come out. The thoughts of all those present were at the height of chaos. An extremely powerful stimulation had almost brought them to rambling incoherence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was different. The Yi Clan… was based in Beisan Province. They were the clan that cultivated and sold the most spirit vegetation! With a great Foundation Establishment cultivator at helm, no one risked envying and lusting after them! A pill master and a clan specialized in cultivating spirit plants, dual swords in harmony… What would come about?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An aurora of golden light was before his eyes. The Yi Clan’s sudden rise was imminent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Yi Clan… Yi Clan…” he opened his mouth wide to gasp for air. He said these few words, but because he was awfully nervous, nothing was said. Yet as he panted, a wild voice rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Golden Dipper Auction Company is willing to gather our entire hall’s full strength to aid Fellow Daoist! We will assist the Xingtian Legion in holding this auction!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If you don’t give this to us, I’ll let you frickin’ see! Don’t think I won’t risk it! I’ll get so crazy that I’ll even scare myself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone looked at the auctioneer in astonishment. This was because… he’d actually screamed these words. Moreover, he huffed and puffed like an ox as he looked at Xu Yangyi. Not even by a sliver did he think this display to be a disgrace. On the contrary, he thought it to be an honor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this opportunity was missed, and other auction companies took it and ran, how would the Golden Dipper Hall still have the ability to have a foot in the auction industry? One didn’t need to ask to know. Whichever auction house seized this opportunity was bound to occupy the fame of the auction industry’s number one!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thou dares!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Old Yi’s body trembled uncontrollably. His clan was the most capable of intimate cooperation with a pill concoctionist, yet he still hadn’t spoken. As he surveyed those unrelated to his line of work, his features grew ugly!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one whatsoever took note that in the last row, Thousandedge’s third secretary had already become frightened out of her wits, separated in both body and soul as she took out her cell phone. “Sir Branchmaster… You, please, c-come at once and t-take a look… Something major has happened! Something big that will shock the entire cultivation world!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What business.” Thousandedge’s somewhat annoyed voice was heard from the phone. This was a strange, rare occurrence. This was the first time he had to make a judgement himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What item could be taken out in a Qi Condensation cultivator’s Legion Inauguration Ceremony? It was practically a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The secretary clenched her teeth with deathly tightness. “A m-m-medicinal pill, a medicinal pill has appeared… A real… Hello? Branch Master? Your Excellency Branch Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An explosive echo was heard from the phone. From then onwards, it was silent.</span></p>
