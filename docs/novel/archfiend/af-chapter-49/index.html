He finally knew that while Xu Yangyi was aware that he couldn’t do anything against him now, Xu Yangyi could frighten him into a cold sweat! This was Xu Yangyi’s deliberate display of strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, I can’t act now, but that doesn’t mean I won’t be able to later! I may not be able to tally this debt for the time being, but sooner or later, there’ll be a time of my reckoning!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Not even mentioning unfinished business, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion would still sever business dealings! A half a year… The financial loss would be over a hundred million, at the minimum!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could his heart not ache? How could it not drip with blood? He might as well go ahead and spill out everything! At the very least, he could still make a retort. Such hesitation and pause really could kill someone!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, it didn’t need to be said… but if some old berserk monsters caught wind of this matter, never mind him, what about his family members?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Chu Tianyi thought of this, he steeled himself! There were still many fugitives that didn’t fear the pursuit of the Cultivation Court! He clenched his hand even tighter, and his fingernails dug into his flesh. His heart ached numbly in pain, as if it was being bitten over and over again by a legion of ants.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our Featherwood Guard will also investigate this at once! Moreover, we’ll give Fellow Daoist an answer as soon as possible!” Hibiscus cupped her hands and said, “In case it’s discovered, headquarters will stop providing the offender’s registered cultivators with missions!”&nbsp;</span></p>

He knew that these people had roughly guessed who it was. However… how could they care about another’s insignificant matter?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one was mentioned by name, and he himself couldn’t suddenly appear. Right now, these people were clearly playing the fool and making all kinds of promises! Moreover, he was without the least bit doubt that they would truly follow through with their promises!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Damn it… Goddamn it!</span></p>

I will give an answer for everyone tomorrow.” Xu Yangyi finished speaking and said no more. He exhausted all of his strength to press down on the bullet in his chest, but the bullet wouldn’t come out as if it had taken root.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling of no qi in his body was too difficult to bear.&nbsp;</span></p>

Regardless of how unwilling everyone was, they couldn’t not give him this face, this esteem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They couldn't be rude to such a hot commodity. Merely, everyone present knew that tomorrow’s price would surely be much higher than today’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The great gate of Core Formation…” A youth of the talisman-specialized Wang Clan looked up towards the sky and sighed, sitting down in his seat. He appeared fairly despondent because of his steep disappointment. “A million cultivators replacing one another as the first falls and the second follows in this struggle for the Grand Dao, all to steal this shred of an opportunity…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This entrance has opened up by a crack now… It's dangled in front of me, but it still doesn’t belong to us…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A single Xu Yangyi is already tempting, as is the exquisiteness of Daomaster Floatingcloud’s chess move, yet I didn’t expect… that in the end, the matter would still be left undetermined…” A clan master said quietly, “Tomorrow… what price will the other clans take out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonchaser’s complexion was awfully ashen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi’s words… Ultimately, it was Daomaster Floatingcloud who had supplied the arcane effort, but Xu Yangyi had unexpectedly not chosen Daomaster Floatingcloud! He was a Core Formation Dao Master! A figure at the world’s apex!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where was the problem? Moonchaser puzzled over this matter a hundred times but was still left without explanation. He turned around and sighed deeply. His face calm, he said to his assistant, “Did you ask Heavens Law whether or not young friend Xu had any other requests when he was studying at the academy? Or perhaps interests?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Excellency…” Dressed in a well-tailored suit, his assistant was somewhat embarrassed. “I don’t know what’s going on… I wasn’t able contact upstairs just now. It seems there’s some issue with the signal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is understandable.” Firecloud overheard their conversation and laughed. “The arena opens only once every five years, so there are too many troubles with the Unrivaled Beneath the Heavens’s comm-circuit installation. The Fengyi City branch isn’t the Shanghai branch, anyways. Where’s all the maintenance money going to come from? Besides…” He picked up his cell phone and shook it. “I can’t get a connection upstairs, either. What’s the worry?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonchaser snorted but didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Something hasn’t happened upstairs, right?” Shadowslay slightly furrowed his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Firecloud looked at Shadowslay like he was crazy, and eventually nodded. “Should be. For example a big explosion or something, hehe…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They laughed casually, their moods not too stifled. After all, at this kind of time, they had already been obviously knocked out of the running. It went without saying that watching the excitement of the object they were unable to obtain would be better.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides the personnel of the Big Three in the VIP section that were still busying themselves, there were still two people without even the shred of a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t a trace of an emotion on Chu Tianyi’s face until a voice came from his side. “Mr. Chu, you’ve gone and prepared wedding clothes for someone else.” <span id="footnote-ref-12d8"><a href="#footnote-12d8">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qi Mingyang…” Chu Tianyi didn’t look at Deputy Branchmaster Qi at his side and said calmly, “If I hand the Immortal Intoxication to you right now, what would be the result?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I dare not lay my hands on it.” Deputy Branchmaster Qi said with trepidation in his heart. “In any case, this is a Heavens Law branch. Of course, I wouldn’t know about what you do, but the nature of the matter is completely different if I put my hands to it. However…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rather than worry about me, wouldn’t it be better to concern yourself with the Chu Clan?” He laughed grimly and set down his teacup. He watched the wooden-faced Chu Tianyi continue to stare straight ahead at the arena. “This kid’s talent could be rated as fiendish. Now that he has obtained the assistance of a Core Formation arcane effort… Among the 20,000 Foundation Establishment cultivators, I’m afraid that his name will be on that list in a few decades, hehe… Mr. Chu, I don’t think he’s the type of man to take things lying down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Tianyi was silent for a long period of time and said calmly, “A true supreme-grade spirit stone to make him disappear.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not enough…” Qi Mingyang said heavily, “There’s a risk to his price now; it’s insufficient.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“State your demands.” Chu Tianyi held his teacup and pursed his lips. “I don’t want to hear his name again within a decade.”&nbsp;</span></p>

This poem depicts the story of a poor woman that makes wedding clothes for other women, but because she is poor does not have the resources to get her own. This phrase has come to be known as an idea of “Doing all the hard work for someone else’s benefit” <a href="#footnote-ref-12d8"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>5. 岁寒三友 - “Three Friends in Winter” This is kinda hard to get down in English, since this phrase is based on a traditional Chinese story/lesson. These three old friends refer to three types of trees: Pine, Bamboo, and Plum. It is said that these three trees are extremely strong and hearty, so that even in the winter, they still grow. It is said that pine is evergreen, never old, bamboo follows the path of the noble, and plum is clear as ice clean like jade. Because these three trees can grow together and remain healthy in the cold of winter together, they are said to be three “friends”. So there is your story inside a story. I would say the girl uses this story in context in an almost mocking manner. <a href="#footnote-ref-ca78"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
