 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 132: Legion Inauguration Ceremony (3)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third level of the hotel. The inside was an expanse of splendidly glorious jade and gold. Each chair emitted a faint fragrance. The entire room had been decorated with an ancient style and elaborate machine-puppets—products of the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion—were serving cups of spirit tea to the present guests. From the mouths of these teacups, a layer of faint qi-steam twisted and swirled about. The tables were also arranged with the year’s spirit fruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From merely the decorations and furnishings, it could be said that this venue had obviously been invested with hard-earned capital. As today’s protagonist, Lu Gandang wore a smile with a sliver of content to it. Taking small and fine brocaded purses, he respectfully handed them over into the hands of the first row of attendees, laughing. “Today is a day of great exultation for my humble self. This is a minor gift. I hope you seniors don’t mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, of course not,” a plump old man laughed as he extended a hand, seemingly declining it, but as he pulled his hand back the fine brocaded purse had already vanished without a trace. “I’m no more than the Great Circle of Qi Condensation, how could I be called ‘senior’?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need to say that, Senior is already at the Great Circle. You’ll surely achieve Foundation Establishment in five to six years. As Mingshui’s Zhen Clan, an inheritance of over 300 years, this word is proper,” Lu Gandang laughed. He himself believed that his own conduct was far better than&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">some</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;cowardly cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Zhen laughed, no longer declining.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Xu.” Lu Gandang handed over a brocaded purse. “This is our first meeting. In the future, this humble one will be growing in Mingshui Province. I’ll have to request Senior for much advice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lean middle-aged man woodenly received the brocaded purse. Cool and collected as he weighed the purse in hand, he then squeezed out a smile’s trace. “The young will surpass the old in time. Do not mention advice. Let us join hands in party for the truth of the Grand Dao. I will be sure to point the way.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked over to another person’s side. Elder Zhen and Elder Xu quietly exchanged a meaningful glance. Elder Zhen transmitted his voice,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You didn’t go Fellow Daoist Xu’s Legion Inauguration Ceremony, either?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Thousandedge is here,”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xu remarked, making Elder Zhen shut his mouth. “He’s overseeing this himself. We local clans of Panshan City cannot sell this face, even if it must be sold. A Foundation Establishment cultivator’s fury is not something you and I are capable of bearing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several seconds of silence, Elder Zhen laughed, “What do you think about this kid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of ridicule flickered through Elder Xu’s eyes. “He believes himself to be infallible… and thinks himself clever.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Five years ago, he was still in Heavens Law. He’s simply ignorant of how desperate that battle was. To be able to survive from the claws of an old half-step Core Formation demon, can Fellow Daoist Xu’s talent be deceived by this superficial showing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right,” Elder Zhen said praisingly, “This kid’s behavior seems steady, but in fact his heart for merits and benefits is too obvious. But Fellow Daoist Xu’s fleeting of years isn’t any good, either. Senior Thousandedge and him appear to be harmonious, but their spirits are divided. Today makes that crystal clear. Otherwise, how would this kid get his turn to lead…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Zhen!” Elder Xu’s tone became grave. “The rights and wrongs of a Foundation Establishment Senior is not something you or I can discuss!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Lu Gandang had already finished giving out all the brocaded purses. A female assistant walked in and quietly said a few words at the side of his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Coward!” As he finished listening to her words, Lu Gandang’s complexion was already flushed red, fiery anger in his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He actually started in advance!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is he that scared to confront me face to face?!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cultivator’s shame! A no-good bastard! Who fucking knows how he managed to survive five years ago!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immediately report this to Senior Thousandedge!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The assistant departed, and Lu Gandang glared daggers at the ceiling. Suddenly, he began to laugh coldly. “So what you pushed things ahead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like you’re just a coward… All that shifting the time earlier does is force you to toss aside some of your honor… Only I can have the cultivation world’s resources! Only I can strive for them! A single step back, retreat at each pace… From here on, the cultivation world no longer has you, Xu Yangyi. Only I, Lu Gandang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Today, I will trample your honor and respect! What can you do about it?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wealth, scripture, companions, and land. Wealth occupied first place, and regardless of who, wealth was impossible to relinquish. At the same time upstairs, several video recorders and cameras took aim at the master stage like firework cannons. There on top, there was one person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The venue had originally been prepared for over a hundred seats. Presently, not even a fifth were filled! An hour before, many who had already agreed to come had changed plans as the time drew near. Likewise, they’d come to the hotel. In the same vein, they were participating in a ceremony, yet they absolutely hadn’t set foot into Xu Yangyi’s lounge. Even the remaining reporters were downcast and in low spirits. All of them were reporters for small cultivation magazines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Today, I’m very happy to be here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Zhaonan gritted his teeth as he heard the speech on the master stage. He wasn’t sure what drug Xu Yangyi was selling in his bottle gourd. Not only was the man not worried, but even the secretary at his side, the woman named Peony, wasn’t nervous, either! The look on her face was carefree and calm! <span id="footnote-ref-ab7c"><a href="#footnote-ab7c">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you disappoint us…” Inhaling deeply, Chu Zhaonan listened to Xu Yangyi’s speech, steady in his expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi faintly paused. His gaze dangerously swept over the entire audience. Presently, there was only him, a lonely and solitary person on stage, and a room full of vacant seats. He looked at the few pages of script in his hand, and his brow gently raised. Confident and in control, he burned the papers into ash with a fireball.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The aforementioned was all bullshit.” Xu Yangyi undid his necktie and looked at everyone. “Today, I only have single thing to say here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snap!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He snapped his fingers, and a tremendous flag suddenly dropped behind him! Xingtian, done in ink on a black background with a white stripe, jumped out vividly on the banner, grasping two greataxes!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From this point onwards, the Xingtian Legion is established!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below, everyone stared blankly. Chu Zhaonan was at a lost. He hadn’t expected at all that Xu Yangyi would be so unconventional! The man didn’t even want to make a speech! Pulling directly to a banner, Xu Yangyi had declared that the Xingtian Legion was inaugurated!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vulture was expressionless. He moreover hadn’t anticipated this. Was this the juncture of Xu Yangyi throwing down the pot after shattering it into pieces, making things even worse? Lilac was also dumbfounded. Xu Yangyi… didn’t even talk about what the legion’s development goals were? He’d cut to the chase and declared the legion established? Wasn’t this too much of a child’s game? <span id="footnote-ref-d28e"><a href="#footnote-d28e">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No… maybe… this isn’t a child’s game at all!” Below the stage, an old man began to narrow his eyes profoundly. “He omitted this… because he has an even more important matter he wants to announce… He very well understands that these issues are all virtually the same. In no way is it the main point of focus… As for what’s to be said later on,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">that</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;is of the highest importance!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man suddenly felt… interested. For him to realize this, everyone soon caught on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chu, what does Brother Xu want to do?” Gao Ye asked lowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know…” Chu Zhaonan’s heart somewhat relaxed, and he narrowed his eyes at the person on stage. “But… it’s definitely big. Based on how crucial a legion’s first step is, he isn’t the type of person to use business like this to tell a joke.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look over there.” Chu Zhaonan gently raised his chin. “That old man is the majordomo of Mingshui’s Yi Clan. The Yi Clan is a great clan overseered by a Foundation Establishment Senior.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That old lady is the assistant to the regional CEO of Beisan Province’s largest cultivation corporation, Grand Gate Materials. I saw her a few times when me and my father ate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That fatty is the broker for Beisan Province’s largest auction business, Golden Dipper Hall. I remember his last name is Li.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are also those young people that look less than twenty. They’re high-ranking directors for the cultivation world’s largest real estate brokers, the Thousand Domains Residence.” Chu Zhaonan’s gaze brightened the more he spoke, and his hand squeezed down on his armrest. “Gao Ye, in this place, we ourselves are not many. But just these few are the true first-class magnates of Beisan Province!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As long as the item that Brother Xu takes out later on can draw their attention, I fucking guarantee…” He licked his lips excitedly. “They won’t even want to go to the Signing Ceremony downstairs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the stage, Xu Yangyi took a slight pause for a period of time. He understood that the greatest storm of the cultivation world was on verge of beginning here! Even in his eyes, a wisp of hard-tolerated excitement flashed through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How interesting.” The old woman of Grand Gate Materials straightened her figure, engrossed. How could they not see the look now on Xu Yangyi’s face? This Legion Inauguration Ceremony possessed an ace… Xu Yangyi should’ve held a shocking trump that could bring the cultivation world to cast sideways glances!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Ge.” The seemingly young man of the Thousand Domains Residence sat in his chair coolly and unperturbed. He said indifferently to the assistant at his side, “Remember, if his proposal is truly good, immediately suggest that our Thousand Domains Residence contract the ten of them cultivation estates. In addition, make sure all of them genuine estates with spirit veins above the minor scale.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a moment of rareness, the old man of the Yi Clan laughed. Their Yi Clan were well-known in the entire nation for spirit plants. Their clan elder was a great cultivator at late-stage Foundation Establishment. Similarly, in his comparison of new recruits without hardly any battle merits to Xu Ynagyi, he was such a cultivator that further admired the demon slayer for being able to survive from the clutches of an old half-step Core Formation demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Assistant Zhao,” he uttered, “If Fellow Daoist Xu’s proposal is indeed good, remember to immediately quote a price later on. It’s good there’s no one here today. In the absence of competitors, how can bystanders understand the preciousness of the seed I’ve chosen…” They were bidders, but they weren’t the ones who shouted price. They held their own unique statuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi breathed in heavily a few times and calmed his emotions. He looked at everyone below the stage. “At the month’s end, the Xingtian Legion will be organizing our first auction.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the floor under the stage was suddenly dead-silent, not a sound in earshot. Now, the feeling of expectation just constructed had been annihilated into flying ash.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the hell is this?!” Luo Sanfeng stared so blankly that he could even said to have been completely stricken dumb. “An auction? What is he selling? Selling his nudes?! What else does he have to sell besides that? What does a Qi Condensation cultivator have that can attract the cultivation world’s focus?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a troublesome scene…” Cultivator Li from the Golden Dipper Hall, even if he himself managed Beisan Province’s largest auction business, shut his eyes in irritation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What good sell did a Qi Condensation cultivator possess? Based on Xu Yangyi’s expression a moment ago, he even believed that Xu Yangyi had a pretty good proposal! But the born fruit was no more than this! It wasn’t that a Qi Condensation cultivator’s auction couldn’t be held, but only Qi Condensation cultivators self-organized. Why?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And it wasn’t even because a low-level cultivator simply didn’t have the cash! The Qi Condensation realm was cultivation’s most initial stage. Their auctions were fundamentally unable to draw the attention of high-end cultivators. Profit was still incomparable to meagerness; who was willing to manage this endeavor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man of the Yi Clan was dazed for a few seconds until the gentle voice of the assistant at his side reminded him, “Sir… may I ask if you still desire this proposal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was then that the truth dawned on him. A bitter smile across his face, he waved his hand self-mockingly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A slip of the eye…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He’d once believed this cultivator Xu was a good seedling and worthy of investment. Who could’ve imagined that such a joke was actually made?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need,” he made a long sigh. “Let’s call it a day. From now on, cancel all attention on the Xingtian Legion. After we return, I will personally apologize for clemency.”</span></p>
