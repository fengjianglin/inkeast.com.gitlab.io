 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cultivation world was hiding a bomb. Nine people had managed to survive an eternally secret land and brought back information from this forbidden realm. No one spoke of this news. This was because everyone clearly understood that its explosion was only a question of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, none had expected who the first would be to trigger this bomb throughout the cultivation world. It wasn’t Xu Yangyi and it wasn’t Daomaster Ancientpine. On the contrary, it was Chinacultivation.com!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘The super news of a lifetime!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Barely a day after the heavenbound door’s collapse, Chinacultivation was the first to tear open this cover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Click… Click…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A slender hand was shaking over a mouse. An index finger nervously tapped the mouse button.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hand’s owner was a youth with dyed red hair. He was completely dumbfounded, looking at his computer screen. His clan was a small clan, but even if it was smaller, he’d still heard about the awesome and terrible name of Longsu’s Danxia Temple Colonnades. How many cultivators with realms even higher than his own clan elders had fallen inside? Today… someone had actually left?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One who was even in the Qi Condensation realm like him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed… as if the image of a descending god had appeared before his eyes. A tall and lofty deity fallen to the mortal realm. Yet the person who had brought this god’s demise was a Qi Condensation cultivator like him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiao Long.” At this time, the door was gently pushed open. A middle-aged woman wearing a qipao walked in with a cup of pill elixir. “Dye your hair back, okay? We’re cultivators, not mortals. The clan elder didn’t say anything to you, there’s no need for you to get upset and act rashly… He… He’s your father in any case… W-What are you doing?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before her voice even fell, the middle-aged woman was storming with anger! She had come in to check up on her son that she was worried about, but unexpectedly he wasn’t reflecting upon himself at all! Instead, he was on the internet!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know what repentance is!” Anger rose up in the middle-aged woman’s heart. She stepped forward and grabbed the youth’s mouse, preparing to tear it away from his hand. She said angrily, “All day long, you don’t know how to cultivate, all you know how to do is be on the internet! What’s the point of these mortal things…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Long seemed to turn a deaf ear, looking at his computer sluggishly. The middle-aged woman unintentionally brushed an eye over the screen and customarily berated him. “You’re obsessed with this computer! Do you think you’re an ordinary person? You…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She suddenly choked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No… that row of large characters just now… appeared to be…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the strength in her hand disappeared. She simply didn’t have the effort to rebuke her son. Instead, she turned her head, creaking like a robot, and peered at the screen in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed… that for the first time in all eternity… Danxia Temple had been broken through?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, impossible… This was clickbait…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound in the room continued to strangely quiet down. Along with Xiao Long, the middle-aged woman began to read the web page together. Not before long, her complexion became redder and redder, and her hand began to faintly tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, she seized the mouse in her son’s hand and started to read!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was true… It was true… It was actually true! There really were people who had departed from Danxia Temple! Nine people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Row by row, character by character, she read for no less than half an hour. Xiao Long was also at the side, reading the report with his eyes wide and tongue tied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My god…” Half an hour later, the middle-aged woman said shakily, “This… could be the appearance of a second Ancestor Floatingcloud…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At a villa in the Capital, an old man was lying down on a recliner in satisfaction. A woman in a qipao who was approximately in her early twenties was gently massaging his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The villa interior was a tranquil bamboo forest. The old man’s recliner was at the side of an ancient-style table and a Purple Sand teapot was arranged on it. Blue birds chirped in the forest and bamboo leaves fell down occasionally. Things appeared incomparably serene. <span id="footnote-ref-ca00"><a href="#footnote-ca00">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man’s brows smoothed. He was enjoying everything in peace. But all of a sudden, his brows furrowed because a wildly frantic sound was trampling on bamboo leaves and rushing towards him with great speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clan Elder! Clan Elder! No good! Something big has happened! Something big has happened in the cultivation world!!!” A middle-aged man, drenched in sweat, dashed over and pulled away the woman’s hands, placing an iPad in front of the old man. “Clan Elder! Hurry up and look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the matter?” The clan elder knitted his brows in annoyance. He ordinarily told his son many times to calm down; how could his son still be so anxious?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just as his gaze scanned the iPad, he immediately stood up with a swoosh! Both of his eyes saucered and he looked at the iPad in front of him incredulously. He promptly took it, his hands and feet in a fit of confusion, yet he discovered that he wasn’t familiar with how to use it at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the heck are you still staring at!!!” He turned his head and angrily reprimanded the man, “Are you just going to keep watching and not help me?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man’s loss of manners couldn’t be blamed because the five large characters on Chinacultivation.com’s front page caused him to completely lose his cool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Danxia Temple was broken through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Danxia Temple was broken through!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“People have left Danxia Temple alive!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By seven or eight o’clock in the morning, this news had spread to all of China! The terrible names of the Eight Great Deadlands were all written in textbooks, in all literature! The cultivation net mentioned them over and over! They were the red dots marked on every major clan’s map!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hundred years… several centuries… nearly a millennium, never were there records of those who had come out alive! However, on this day, there were now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you saying?!” In Nantong Province, Tianzhu Mountain was a national tourism district famous for its scenery. In the vast landscape, there existed a quiet valley shrouded in thick clouds that mankind could not enter, located in Tianzhu Mountain’s most famous and scenic “Absolute Beauty Ravine”. At this moment in the valley, a middle-aged man suddenly opened his eyes that had been closed for many years. He looked at the floating paper crane in front of him in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clan Elder! Come out of seclusion and take a look! Really! It’s true! Danxia Temple’s been broken through! One of the Eight Great Deadlands has been reported as defeated!!! The cultivation net is blowing up right now!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this voice even fell, the man’s figure was no longer seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this day, all of China’s cultivation world—so long as one was cultivator who was on the internet—had been stirred into a frenzy! As for those not online, they were all notified by their friends on the phone of this major news!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chinacultivation.com’s central headquarters, the technology department was presently crowded with people. The entire tech staff was sweating up a storm, clicking and clacking as they typed. Today, Chinacultivation.com welcomed their highest summit in the past several decades! There had been a couple server restarts! All of China’s old cultivators that didn’t know how to access the cultivation net seemed to come alive! Hundreds of thousands of people were swarming and suffocating their web page! Heaven knows that the cultivation net’s ordinary web hits were at most in the tens of thousands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And this web page was all discussion and question threads. So long as the poster had a little fame, almost each post was followed by at least several hundred to a thousand comments!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Congratulations to my great Chinese cultivation world!!!

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a huge pile of such junk threads. The significance of Danxia Temple’s capture didn’t lay in whether someone could come out alive, but rather someone had finally pried open the door of one of the Eight Great Deadlands that caused the entire cultivation world to pale at their mention! This conqueror, this young cultivator, told everyone that a deadland wasn’t truly a place of certain no-return!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This… would spur a horrific tempest!

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last person to leave a deadland was Ancestor Floatingcloud. However, he couldn’t be said to have captured it and really didn’t kill his way in throughout his journey. Instead, under the coincidence of destiny, he’d entered the heart of the Dragon Hole. Moreover, he held the great fortune and blessing to leave without the slightest hair of an injury. How could such a living legend, a great living destiny, not cause the hearts of all cultivators to gallop and dream!</span></p>
