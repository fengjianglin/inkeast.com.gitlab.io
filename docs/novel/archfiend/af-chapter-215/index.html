 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 215: Danxia Temple (34)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little mongrel… If I don’t pull out your tendons and flay your skin, it will be an injustice to the Nangong Clan’s grace!” Qiao Wu had gone insane. The Nangong’s Sixth Master had died here. After returning, they would surely be buried together with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the wake of his anger and fright intertwining, his voice started to tremble. His body had already started to involuntarily transform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His head of white hair frantically grew, and his face also turned pointed. His clothes began to break apart layer by layer, and his claws grew sharper and sharper. In a state of rage and fright, he’d already started to fully demonize!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fifty-two seconds… Fifty-two seconds…” Quan Liu’s voice was brimming with disbelief. By no means had he foreseen that his young master, a proud son of heaven, would be beheaded within fifty-two seconds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the foe encountered was half-step Foundation Establishment like them, he could still accept it. However, it wasn’t! On the contrary, it was a cultivator with the same late-stage Qi Condensation cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who was he to blame? The young master for being too stupid? It truly wasn’t so! Nangong Xiaoran wasn’t dumb at all. In arcane combat, Nangong Xiaoran had been utterly defeated very few times! Otherwise, it was absolutely impossible for him to enter the clan’s echelon! Or hold such a high ranking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was he to blame this opponent for being too cunning?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps this was how it was… The chain of strategies just now had created slivers of complacency. It was this sliver of ease that allowed Xu Yangyi to kill his opponent in a flash! Were it not because Nangong Xiaoran was the one who was killed, he would practically be applauding Xu Yangyi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He actually… actually killed Nangong Xiaoran…” God Ming Twelve looked at everything before his eyes in amazement and soon trembled coldly from head to toe.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was Nangong Xiaoran… A single-digit ranker… Even Sister Nine wouldn’t go provoking him rashly, not to mention that he even brought two half-step Foundation Establishment with him this time. Now… those two half-step Foundation Establishment ACTUALLY didn’t save him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he recalled that he’d once provoked Xu Yangyi and openly declared his desire to kill the legion commander, he couldn’t help but shiver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yet he was killed anyways…” Sister Nine gently bit her lip. “Fortunately, I blocked him back then, otherwise, the person’s head being displayed here right now wouldn’t be Nangong Xiaoran’s…” She turned towards God Ming Twelve and said coldly, “But yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This kid… definitely isn’t normal…” The Ye Clan’s Old Four pursed his lips. For the first time, he deeply memorized Xu Yangyi’s figure. Without nearly any consideration, he said lowly to his other clansmen, “If we get out alive, I want all his data!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, not a single one of Greenwall’s Three Swords opened their mouths. They knew Nangong Xiaoran. In the same vein, they also knew that he was extremely troublesome. Moreover, he had even come with two half-step Foundation Establishment! He could be considered the power that they were most unwilling to provoke here. Nonetheless… right now, in front of their eyes, he’d been cleaved in two by a single cut!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ling Xiaozi.” His expression grave, Xuan Chengzi spoke out, “I recognized he was strong before… Now, I’ll make a correction. This person isn’t just good in realm… His comprehensive strength is even stronger!” He said with seemingly deep meaning, “You lost to him in nothing more than a bout of spiritual sense. If things can be ignored, it would be best not to bother about this. This person… is not easily provoked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the wake of Nangong Xiaoran’s head falling to the ground, the present scene returned to complete silence. Everyone had confirmed that someone had died, but none had expected that the leader of the Nangong Clan’s team, someone from the Five Great Demon Clans, had been beheaded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gazes converged on Nangong Xiaoran’s head, the hawk-headed demon’s eyes still wide open in death. Fahui softly chanted and shared a glance with Ye Old Four. Appearing to come to an agreement, they happened to respectively collect their rosary beads and gemmed parasol. Sister Nine gently beckoned and her corpse puppet returned to her side. She and Yi Old Five snorted coldly in unison, and her gaze turned to Xu Yangyi with seemingly deep meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huff…” At this time, an exhale was heard from behind. Fang Cheng had regained consciousness. His healing abilities were too astonishing. Presently, the wounds on his body looked to be more or less gone. As he opened his eyes, he took in the landscape in front of him and gasped coldly, “Junior Brother! This…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t finish speaking because Xu Yangyi made a gesture for him to be silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi walked over to his side, helped him up, and said, “In a chaotic battle… just like this, everyone is looking for all opportunities to eliminate an outsider. Nangong Xiaoran’s already died… but Qiao Wu and Quan Liu haven’t! Besides… they’re going crazy against the Xingtian Legion and coming for revenge.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother?” Fang Cheng snapped his head up, believing himself to have heard incorrectly. He’d personally crossed hands with Nangong Xiaoran. He knew how difficult the other was to handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi gently shook his head and said seriously, “So… everyone’s goal right now is me. In the Xingtian Legion and the Nangong Clan’s battle, no one joined in. You see that Quan Ningyue’s hands are shaking… We’re the best elimination target… If there’s an additional strong person here, fine, but the best is a dead strong person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fang Cheng spoke no further. Instead, he mustered his qi with every fiber of his being. Even he could sense the hidden, dense killing intent in those seemingly placid gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Qiao Wu and Quan Liu failed to kill the Xingtian Legion… those in wait could still take advantage of the opportunity to attack. In this place, there was no morality of the Rivers and Lakes, only the law of the jungle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a furious roar echoed throughout the entire region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going to bury you all together!!!” A giant skylark shockingly emerged within Zhao Wuye’s seal. It was approximately thirty meters in size and released a piercing cry towards the sky, madly rushing towards Zhao Wuye and Mao Ba’er! The giant skylark was nearly insane! A raspy screech came from its mouth. The swiftness of its speed even caused the soil on the ground to churn because of its rapid charge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God Ming Twelve’s gaze flashed, and his hand stirred. However, it was immediately pressed down by Sister Nine. She gently shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not time…” Sister Nine said quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Brother?” Behind Fahui, a copper man asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fahui’s expression was unchanging, and he also shook his head. “Wait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiao Wu’s distance from the deathly pale-faced Zhao Wuye and Mao Ba’er was already less than ten meters. Xu Yangyi yelled out at once, “Undo the seal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuye gritted his teeth. Undo to the seal? How could it be undone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A normal seal basically wasn’t able to trap an old half-step Foundation Establishment monster! Already, there was a fair difference of substance between such a character and the Qi Condensation realm! This formation was one that he’d extended and laid down with his essence blood. Even if he wanted to undo it, it absolutely wouldn’t be unraveled in a second!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And to half-step Foundation Establishment… ten meters was truly crossed in a splinter of time! A second wasn’t even needed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck… who would’ve thought that I, Zhao Wuye, would lose my life here…” Zhao Wuye’s complexion was pale. Even now, he could feel the enormous pressure brought by this now-demonized half-step Foundation Establishment bearing down on him. It was a kind… of power that could seemingly force one’s body to collapse!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was absolutely unable to take it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the side, Mao Ba’er had long since fallen into unconsciousness after his neck had been punched through. Even if his neck hadn’t been pierced, he still couldn’t do anything against the sure-kill attack of an old half-step Foundation Establishment monster that had nearly lost all sanity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not a single word left Xu Yangyi’s lips. He lifted up Falling Moon, revolved all his spiritual force, and then rushed towards Zhao Wuye’s seal. Even if he did go in, there wouldn’t be any effect. Nonetheless, he wouldn’t avoid entering just because it appeared it would be fruitless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How others treat me is how I treat them! Even if I have to run through the entire crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi clearly sensed the inside of his body. After the great battle, his meridians were like water pumps, and he drew upon the meager amount of spiritual force still left. At the same time, his spiritual sense was fully unleashed, and Pill Cauldron Builds Spirit was activated and maintained. He understood that as soon as Nangong Xiaoran had died, the surrounding pack of waiting wolves wouldn’t mind casually eliminating him at all. After all, he, who had killed Nangong Xiaoran, was too conspicuous at this moment. So conspicuous that he&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">forced</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;everyone else to take notice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, Qiao Wu was wildly approaching ahead, and Zhao Wuye and Mao Ba’er were faced with the crisis of a fatal blow. Behind, everyone seemed harmonious but held underlying thoughts within their hearts. If the Xingtian Legion then lost their soldiers or commander under Qiao Wu’s and Quan Liu’s hands… they wouldn’t be able to exit Danxia Temple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” At the brink of mortal peril, an aged voice, soon to be buried, suddenly rang out and coughed severely, “Cough, cough… This Throne is still unaware… when could half-step Foundation Establishment call themself ‘This Throne’?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as this voice fell, an ancient palm-sized bronze mirror shockingly appeared in front of Zhao Wuye and Mao Ba’er. As for Qiao Wu’s colossal body, it suddenly charged over. However, in the next second, everyone’s pupils dilated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mirror… seemed bottomless! It surprisingly took Qiao Wu’s entire body and stored it inside! Soon after, in the place Qiao Wu was originally standing, space fluctuated. Once again, Qiao Wu mysteriously appeared in his prior position!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“M-Magik treasure! This is a magik treasure!” Everyone had believed Mao Ba’er, originally soon to be dead, had passed out and died. Who would’ve expected that his ears would twitch and his eyes would quietly narrow into slits? The demonized husky had clearly witnessed everything and scuttled back up afterwards. Furthermore, he viciously barked and roared at the skylark, his body seemingly brimming with enthusiasm. “Come! C’mon! Come at me, I’ll take you on anywhere and anytime, straight up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A good picture of a dog relying on his master’s power to make threats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuye hated that he couldn’t kick this lowly dog to death, yet he simply didn’t have the time to consider this. Opposite from him, Qiao Wu looked at him in shock. Afterwards, crimson eyes darted over to the place from where the aged voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over yonder was a hunched-back old man who was leaning on a walking stick, thin like a monkey. He gently waved his hand, and the ancient mirror produced a glorious radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scram… cough, cough…” The old man coughed twice. “Give thanks that you lot aren’t dead… If this was outside… I would’ve killed you a million times long ago… cough, cough…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bloodblade?” Sister Nine’s gaze faintly rippled. “Why has he suddenly appeared?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He should’ve only come to search for things to prolong his lifespan. He shouldn’t care about the Heavenmend Stone too much…” God Ming Twelve also thought this to be strange. “From the beginning until now, he hasn’t tried to find an ally, but now he’s shown up…” His voice yet to fall, he discovered Sister Nine was looking straight at him. He said with a confused tone, “What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You just said…” Sister Nine gritted her teeth. “He hasn’t found an ally?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">God Ming Twelve nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sister Nine turned her head and fixed her eyes on Xu Yangyi. “You’re wrong… It wasn’t that he wasn’t looking… I understand… He was examining. Examining who had the qualifications to be his ally… but he actually… didn’t choose the Buddhist Monastery or the Dao Sect. He went so far as to…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you saying he chose the Xingtian Legion?! That weak chicken of a legion that has nothing more than middle-stage Qi Condensation besides its commander?!” God Ming Twelve’s eyes snapped wide open, and he looked at Sister Nine incredulously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If not… what do you think he’s doing right now!” Sister Nine gnashed her teeth and said, “Why would he help out that man and dog? Mercy for the heart? Utter nonsense!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In her heart, she thrashed in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Xingtian Legion… or perhaps it could be said that Xu Yangyi was too dazzling. Now was the best opportunity to eliminate them. Unexpectedly… Bloodblade was still alive and had walked into this place! Furthermore, he’d revealed himself in this developing moment and stuck his hand in!</span></p>
