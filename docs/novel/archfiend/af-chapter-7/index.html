 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?” A voice could be heard from within the closed room. “I have no choice but to remind you, but the time allotted for the graduation exam is limited to a week. As of now, five days have already passed. The provincial branch is waiting on the Yuyang City branch’s summary report… I hope I don’t have to tell you again how low the Heavens Law graduation rate is. And about how many people are watching each branch’s exam?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I found the demon.” Xu Yangyi started up his computer and glanced at the web page. Subsequently, he knitted his brows. “...Mao Ba’er… I’ve warned you many times, you’re only my manager. My allowance each month before I’ve graduated is only a thousand…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the problem?” the voice within the room rang out suspiciously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi looked at the open string of Taobao web pages, his eyes narrowing somewhat dangerously. “At 50 bucks per piece, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion’s Purification Talisman has to be circulated for half a month to step into Qi Condensation…The Drifting Snow of Mount Emei’s Nine Hidden Monasteries’ Jade Pools can enhance a smidgen of qi, but the most important aspect is the absolutely great taste… at 500 a piece? A live explanation of the secret to cultivation, a single reward is a hundred bucks, and you gave five rewards, using all of my Alipay… Get the hell out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of a lock fell upon the room, and Mao Ba’er ran off without a second thought. Xu Yangyi picked up his cell phone and looked at it. Just great… Of the 10,000 Chinese dollars that he had deposited, only 800 remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ding dong…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At this moment, a familiar sound rang out from the web page.

A customer service agent named Yan Nanzi. Without delay, he opened the door.</span></p>

Our instructional series is taught by one of China’s ten great Core Formation cultivators, Daomaster Cloudcrane, who goes by the web-handle of ‘Idle Clouds, Feral Crane’. It is through science, rational analysis, and many real-world examples that offer evidence to dissect the environment of the new cultivation age one by one that we can learn how to properly handle the resources of both humans and demons, and understand how cultivation is a massive industry to the entire nation and the entire globe. This includes the formation of cooperative relationships between these mega corporations. While this module won’t let you win straight off the bat, you’ll end up coming straight through the finish line.”</span></p>

If you don’t have the opportunity to listen to the teachings of the cultivation world’s premier educational institution, these lessons alone are capable of dispelling the doubts that muddy the way of the Grand Dao.

It has surpassed the lessons of the other few Core Formation cultivators in business. Daomaster Cloudcrane is also publicly recognized as the foremost Daoist educator.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist, nowadays, scientific methods are employed to analyze cultivation. This isn’t the Ancient Cultivation age anymore, but that of Cultivation Civilization. How does the human body absorb qi? What is the composition division of the essence of qi? Perhaps it is the proton? A quantum? How is it circulated within the human body? How do the ancient circulation techniques promote qi operation? All of this is analyzed in detail to you by Daomaster Cloudcrane… What I’m trying to say is that to miss out on this would be your greatest loss. In understanding of the financial hardship that many initial-stage cultivators face, our shop doesn’t support payment in installments. However, we do support payment with items.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can pay with items?” Xu Yangyi’s eyes shimmered, and he immediately asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The times were different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivation was a thing of the past that dated back hundreds of years, thousands of years, and as far back as over ten thousand years ago. Currently, cultivation had already become a kind of civilization. In comparison to the ancient cultivators of thousands of years ago, there was a substantial difference!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This so-called civilization has strengthened humanity’s adaptation and perception of the objective world in line with human spiritual pursuit. It was the cultural spirit that a staggering amount of people approved and accepted, and the sum of human innovation and spirit in addition to public order and civility. It allowed humans to cast off the assembly of antiquated situations that composed all societal and natural conduct. These ideals coursed through the concept of family, tools, language, script, conviction, religious ideology, law, the ideas of city-states and nations, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Present cultivation was a practice polished so quietly that it was secretly integrated into the lives of every person. It influenced small aspects like clothing, food, home, and work, and then major aspects such as secretive mining reclamations and the contrast of strength between nations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the age of science, Cultivation Civilization, which was incapable of being explained by science, just happened to slowly become the endless expansion of the primordial apex. <span id="footnote-ref-fff9"><a href="#footnote-fff9">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s quite simple. If you hunt a demon, there are auctions undergoing at the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion in every city. Our store holds a close collaborative relationship with the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion and through the appraisal of the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion’s experts, they can send the assessment to our shop. If the object and the price of the treasure are equal, our shop will make the delivery. If the price isn’t the same, we’ll have to ask Fellow Daoist to continue his best efforts. If the value exceeds the price, our shop will reimburse Fellow Daoist with the excess amount. You see?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A contract adhered to prosperity. Xu Yangyi glanced over it for a while and nodded. “No problem. I’ll have prey tomorrow night. My manager will contact the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very well, I wish you good health and merriment. May you eternally remain without heart devils, not chance upon thunderous calamity, and your cultivation soar by leaps and bounds.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shutting the computer off, Xu Yangyi needed a good sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavens Law graduation rate wasn’t high, yet every single graduate was an elite. However, the cultivator community was only so big that they merely made up a million people in China’s preliminary statistics! Did a Dao Master require an intelligent and capable assistant? Did Foundation Establishment seniors want right-hand men to settle their issues without worry and attend to inconvenient matters? Didn’t Qi Condensation cultivators want to join some organization to enlighten themselves? To seek assistance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were job openings everywhere, but… excellent talents were still too few in number!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each year’s graduation exam was everyone’s opportunity to display their abilities. Xu Yangyi had an excellent understanding that even Core Formation masters would be closely following the graduation exam’s list of names. Their think tanks would make evaluations in every aspect, from a student’s potential, inner quality, and strength. A majority of people would enter a branch of Heavens Law, but in case someone was heavily favored by a Dao Master or some super organization, this favor would be absolutely far better than their present circumstances, even if they didn’t know how they would be treated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inhaling deeply, he shut his eyes. Tomorrow’s demon extermination would be his first; he was determined to succeed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed quickly. Through the night, nothing whatsoever occurred. The next day, Xu Yangyi sat down in his seat and drank his tea as always, indifferently observing the chatter of his “subordinates”. He coolly took today’s newspaper and watched all the people in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To step into cultivation, a person had to be born with something called spiritual sense. Simply put, a person could send out countless “feelers”, and through these “feelers”, they could perceive the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, they could see things. Spiritual sense didn’t require him to use his vision at all. On the contrary, perhaps it could be said that this “vision” allowed cultivators see through that which was true and that which was false. For example, he could see things that the ordinary people of Sanshui City were simply unable to. But let alone common citizens, he would still be uncaring, granted that something of such a nature was before him, as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Presently, his newspaper concealed his front, making it seem like he couldn’t see anything. Nonetheless, his spiritual sense swept over the features of everyone present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They chatted and cracked melon seeds between their teeth. No one was paying attention to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was to slay a demon, he would need firepower support. He didn’t hope for this support to be of any use, though. The critical point was… that after he and the demon truly started to fight, both sides would throw caution to the wind and grind themselves down to the last bone. On one side was one of humanity’s superhumans, and on the other was a living fossil that had carried on since ancient times. Xu Yangyi’s most initial fear was that the demon was much, much older than him by ten-somewhat years. If he didn’t exterminate his opponent, the other would flee, and the entire city would become the floor of an unexpected catastrophe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as his firepower support could obstruct the demon… just a little bit, the government and the agents of Heavens Law would be able to totally suppress the event. In China, the power of the government was formidable. Completely different from that of western multiparty nations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The question right now, however… was how was he going to make the people who saw him as an eyesore listen obediently?</span></p>
