 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It… was a bodily sensation of a limb leaving the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“Commander!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“Spud!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many alarmed cries suddenly rang out. Each person saw that after Xu Yangyi retreated from Wei Zhongxian’s mouth, his person was fine. However, his left arm was but empty space!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pant… Pant…” Cool gasps came from between Xu Yangyi’s clenched teeth. Over and over without end in sight, his pale lips shivered. He was already soaked with blood from head to toe. His body had sustained heavy injuries, and his left arm was lost. Still, he didn’t look to his wounds, but rather straight at the corpse puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Zhongxian was motionless. He… had just stiffened in place like so. After five seconds, the four Dharma Wheels on his figure exploded into a radiance that instantly filled the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rustle…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corpse puppet’s eyes, nose, and mouth shot out rays of pure white qi that slowly rose into the sky. It was as if Wei Zhongxian was evaporating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Infinite, limitless, and separated somewhat far away, a skybound pillar of white qi was all that could be seen. It revolved in the vast lotus sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This heart-shaking berserk qi swept across the entire neighboring space! On the ocean surface, a hurricane appeared to have blown through. Tides rose and fell in succession and the surrounding lotuses looked back in harmony!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” Fahui resisted the feeling of his body teetering on collapse. He gritted his teeth and used his kasaya to block his face, looking at the landscape. Only the white spiritual light heading to the sky was seen in the middle. In the vicinity, four spirit lights, black, white, azure, and violet in color, erupted and dyed the sky with rich and varied colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Suc… cess?” His eyes were fairly red. No one was willing to die. Even if his eyes were swimming, he was still begrudging to blink away from this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, every place that his eyes touched was a multicolored domain. He couldn’t make anything out at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Chengzi didn’t speak, merely sheltering his face. Right now… qi hurried and rushed like the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers clashing head-on! Through the seams of his fingers, he observed the multicolored spiritual light. Even though it was piercing to the eyes, he was still unwilling to part his gaze from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many eyes forcibly resisted the multicolored spiritual light that dazzled the pupils. They looked at the space above the lotusless ocean surface. Even if they couldn’t see in this situation, they’d heard their clansmen say that this was a qi leakage after a seal’s destruction. The whereabouts of the mighty figure who had crafted Wei Zhongxian into a corpse puppet were unknown. After several centuries, the elimination of the corpse puppet had actually leaked out qi in this manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this time, the corpse puppet suddenly yelped out in fright. Although its voice wasn’t loud, everyone heard it all too clear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Awakened… She… has awakened… She has awakened!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the final screech of the corpse’s existence in this world. After this voice, the sky flashed with glittering white light. In the end, everyone could endure no more and closed their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as the white light flashed, it died away. When everyone opened their eyes, Wei Zhongxian no longer had a trace of qi. In this instant, he was truly dead. He returned again several hundred years into the past, a ghost returning to the netherworld.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly afterwards, he was like a marionette cut from its strings, plummeting down with a crash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">SPLASH!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In the pond water, a person-tall ocean spray splashed up! Wei Zhongxian had once been dismembered into five parts. This time, his extremities completely separated! There was no further black qi connection among them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amitabha…” Fahui’s face revealed a mournful color. He glanced at all the copper men on the lotus leaves who had already died in battle and then turned to the corpse puppet on the ocean surface. “You ought to descend to the eighteenth layer of hell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daofather above…” Xuan Chengzi was the sole survivor among Greenwall’s Four Swords. His grieved expression carried a sliver of relief, and he sighed deeply. He closed his eyes and meditated, saying no more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rustle rustle rustle!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Endless brilliance continued to spiral in the sky, charging straight to the horizon. It was similar to fluttering spirit butterflies. Everyone felt terribly perplexed, and they watched the unleashed light pillar of qi revolve in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, time and space seemed to halt. Among those still alive, a sensation of escaping mortal danger was spontaneously born.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Victory… Victory! They… had survived from the hands of an old initial-stage Foundation Establishment monster! Baptized via the five Heavenly Opening divine abilities, they survived in the end! From among a thousand, only ten remained! However, they stood staunchly until the end!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We won?” Zhao Wuye sluggishly stood on a lotus leaf, trembling all over as he surveyed the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huff…” In this moment, Mao Ba’er, Zhao Ziqi, Li Zongyuan, Quan Ningyue, and Fang Cheng sighed in relief. They all collapsed on their lotus leaf without the slightest pause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We survived… Great…” Fang Cheng glanced at the oppressively black sky and finally closed his eyes. He could no longer hold on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene was calmly dreadful. After an unknown passage of time, Fahui stood up and bowed deeply towards Xu Yangyi. “Benefactor, Mount Song’s Shaolin Temple will remember this grace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Chengzi’s gaze flashed. Fahui actually came from Mount Song? It was no wonder… that he could endure for such a long time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this thought merely flashed in his mind. The sword-cultivator struggled to stand up and also bowed deeply. “Xuan Chengzi… In place of the deceased Qing Jingzi, Wu Weizi, and Ling Xiaozi, I offer my thanks to Fellow Daoist…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Fellow Daoist… for avenging this poor Daoist’s three apprentice-brothers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sister Nine and Yi Old Five didn’t speak. Their eyes narrowed into slits, and they deeply eyed Xu Yangyi. They took his silhouette and branded it in their hearts. Afterwards, they shut their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were unwilling to have this man as an enemy. Not only did he treat his foes mercilessly, but he was likewise merciless to himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I really don’t know…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time Sister Nine closed her eyes, she noiselessly sighed. She truly did not know… where in the world this monster came from…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, none were aware that underwater, the last chain on a shadowy body—a red chain—loudly crumbled apart! The four other Dharma Wheels on the chains were all eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below the water, it was quiet. Very quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unknown passage of time went by. Countless air bubbles slowly floated up from underwater. Soundless and silent, unknowing and unaware...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the water’s surface, Xu Yangyi lay down on top of the Chasing Skylark. The pain of his severed arm tormented every single one of his nerves. Nonetheless, he didn’t have too much time to wallow in pain. Xuan Chengzi and Fahui bowed to him. He accepted, and to accept was a proper matter. Looking to his heart, there was no shame; a clear conscience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it weren’t for him, not a single person here was capable of surviving! But right now, he had an even more important matter to accomplish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Animus Armament. At this moment, his long-cherished wish had finally come full circle. For it, he hadn’t hesitated to find Daomaster Jadewave and look for an expert archaeologist. In order to solve its mystery, he didn’t hesitate to personally enter Danxia Temple’s underside. At long last, now was the time to unravel all of its secrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the half-box on his chest emitted a golden light that filled the sky. With a swoosh, it flew away from his chest by itself! In the next second, this golden light transformed from a sliver into a domain! In the end, it actually extended as far as the eye could see!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish swish swish…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In the sky’s curtain, violet talismans all around had already become a backdrop. In this instant, boundless golden light sprinkled down. They were cheering and in high spirits, in the throes of extreme joy for reuniting after a thousand years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The screen of golden light slowly rippled in the sky. It was transparent, pure, and holy… but carried an inviolable mighty pressure. It was akin to a god’s descent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From some unknown place, the gentle sound of a wooden fish echoed. Afterwards, the entire sky quietly, but audibly, rang out with a stretch of wooden fish sounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sea, Wei Zhongxian’s corpse was scattered across a hundred meters. However, following the emergence of these musical instruments and their slow beating… the bloody air surprisingly grew weak. The tension of battle was unconsciously brushed away from the heart and replaced with a kind of post-fight tranquility and spiritual purity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the wake of these wooden fish noises, a white character appeared in the sky little by little. It wasn’t large, but it was able to occupy the human eye. It wasn’t magnificent, but it was able to enshroud one's spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This character carried a mysterious charm that anyone, including cultivators, were unable to describe with words. It was like an ink painting unhurriedly spreading open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi’s gaze slightly flashed. He hadn’t expected that the two parts of the Animus Armament united could actually give rise to such a scene. Peering at the already faintly discernible character in the sky, he couldn’t help but read it aloud, “Dao… Dao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, following his recital of this word, the entire world started to tremble! It was different from Wei Zhongxian’s divine abilities a little while ago. This time… there wasn’t any divine ability! This word had caused space to shake! It was as if Danxia Temple was unable to bear this word!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This!” Originally, Fahui looked like he was soon to die. Upon bearing witness to this sight, he sprang up on his feet with a strength of unknown origin! Cold sweat slid down his forehead, drop by drop. His entire kasaya was swelling by itself in the absence of the wind! He watched everything before him incredulously!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huff… This… This is… T-This is impossible… I-It’s only a legend…” At this moment, Xuan Chengzi forcibly braced his heavily wounded body and jumped up. He felt his heart speeding up into wild palpitations!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They came from the three great ancient sects. There were some old secret tales passed down through the successive generations. Time was too long. Never had anyone witnessed them, and they had already become legend!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao Realm…” Xuan Chengzi’s entire body was shivering. Without warning, he devoutly kneeled on his flying magik artifact. His voice was hoarse and his face revealed zealotry. “D-Disciple Xuan Chengzi! I respectfully welcome the Emperor Armament of Daoism coming into the world!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thud thud thud!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;This wasn’t the sound of wooden fish. Instead, Xuan Chengzi was kowtowing on his magik artifact as if his life depended on it. Blood quickly flowed down from his forehead, yet he was totally unaware!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Animus Armament… These two words emerged in Xuan Chengzi’s and Fahui’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This… was the worldly anomaly of an Animus Armament’s true emergence… Fortunately… Fortunately this region was the bottom of Danxia Temple! Otherwise, if this relic harmonized in the outside world, all above Foundation Establishment would be able to see this strange phenomenon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All that filled Xuan Chengzi’s eyes was Xu Yangyi’s figure. All that remained in his heart was a believer’s hot blood. Presently, even if Xu Yangyi wanted him to die, he wouldn’t make a noise! Knocking against his magik artifact, he abruptly recalled something. He quickly spat out a mouthful of blood, and a blood-dyed silver sword-core hummed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already looking at Fahui with an obvious murderous aura. In spite of this, the murderous aura in Fahui’s eyes was no less than his!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moments ago, the two super sects had exerted all power to collaborate. But now that the Animus Armament had come into being, a struggle of orthodoxies came under way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I truly did not expect…” Fahui coughed out a mouthful of blood. “That Fellow Daoist Xu… was actually hiding an Animus Armament on him…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need for more words.” In this instant, Xuan Chengzi and Fahui were burning their lives. Xuan Chengzi waved, and his sword-core droned and flew in front of him. “In the struggle of orthodoxies, there is nothing more but war.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you want to lay hands on Fellow Daoist Xu, you’ll have to step over this poor Daoist’s corpse!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fahui’s expression was gloomy. He never expected this… He absolutely hadn’t! At the bottom of Danxia Temple, Wei Zhongxian’s corpse actually concealed such an item! In his present state, he wasn’t Xu Yangyi’s and Xuan Chengzi’s opponent by any stretch!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Xuan Chengzi, he steeled his heart to protect Xu Yangyi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he had said, he would go on until death put Fahui to an end!</span></p>
