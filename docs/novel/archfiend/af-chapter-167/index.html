 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 167: The Last</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fifth was a rogue cultivator named Gao Wuguo. In all of Xu Yangyi’s battles, he’d used Azure Dragon Seeks Cauldron twice. Once against Quan Ningyue and once against Gao Wuguo. Nevertheless, it was still a single fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sixth… was actually the chief disciple of an unknown third-rate clan, Song Zifu. His battle strength wasn’t all that strong, but his strength laid in his mental power and that he’d already advanced in level in both Daos of Talismancy and Artificing. If it weren’t for the fact that Zhuzhou’s Song Clan was very small, there simply wouldn’t be resources to train the two great money-burning crafts of talismans and artificing. There was no question that such talent was begrudgingly parted with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Song Zifu had been selected, the several old men who’d followed from the Song Clan suddenly took long, deep sighs. However… this battle was one fist as before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last was Yao Xintan of Beijing’s Yao Clan. His name was somewhat womanly, but the name of the Seven Devilslayer Blades was not undeserved. Even if the Yao Clan had gradually declined, they were a meter-deep gorge on the floor path of the forty-nine days, seven nails per each seven days, still able to draw no question from the majority of people. <span id="footnote-ref-7e8b"><a href="#footnote-7e8b">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what caused the gazes of those in the stadium to become increasingly shocked… was that this battle with the Seven Devilslayer Blades was still one punch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi’s strength reigned free, a cool breeze brushing the mountaintop. His willfulness was unyielding, a bright moon illuminating a great river. <span id="footnote-ref-c5f8"><a href="#footnote-c5f8">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All gazes focused on Xu Yangyi’s body. This commander… How powerful was his strength in the end? Counted among the past paragons of Heavens Law with such surpassing strength, perhaps there were no more than five! Which one of them wasn’t awesome and famous today? Hopeful for Core Formation! Included within them was the number one of all past graduations named Sunnihilator! This was a name that all of humanity drew as goal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be… this is the the second Sunnihilator?” A cultivator pursed his lips, bearing a fiery and envious gaze as he looked at Xu Yangyi and murmured, “It seems all the rounds have been ties, but… Commander Xu has only made a single fist the entire time. As for this fist, do each of these chosen legionnaires actually recognize victory and defeat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the final bell tolled… who was leaving who honor? No one was willing to go. Xu Yangyi, this name so dreadfully subdued. This time, after being paid attention to by a great many high-level figures, he’d finally walked into the vast “common masses”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This recruitment was bound to leave an inextinguishable shadow in the hearts of too many people, a target to overtake!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A second-rate clan departed in silence. The recognized seed of their clan turned his head back to glance at Xu Yangyi’s figure and inwardly gritted his teeth. “In twenty years… I’ll be sure to find you again to talk about heroes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just wait…” The Lu Clan quietly left the floor, and a veiled woman from the Lu Clan looked deeply at Xu Yangyi. “Next time, I’ll have you personally choose me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The amount of people in the venue was on a steady decline, yet the atmosphere was becoming hotter and hotter! There were still three places! The final three!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In contrast to those who were stiflingly nervous, the legionnaires who’d taken a position were already deepening their relations together. Zhan Twelve was an exception, though; he was the kind of outsider that didn’t like interaction. The others had all gathered in company. A kind of relaxed mood gave those who remained to be chosen an inferno of heat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Yao. When the time comes, you’ll have to look after this little sister.” Qin Xueluan flashed a charming look of the eyes at Yao Xintan, not masked in the slightest. Yao Xintan’s height was around 1.83 meters, and he had brows like swords and eyes like stars, a model of good lucks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet towards Qin Xueluan’s flirtatious glances, Yao Xintan could only cough dryly, “When the time comes, everyone will naturally be looked after a lot…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a joke. He liked gentle, soft women, not women that could summon a viper with a kiss. And that wasn’t sure to say… if Qin Xueluan had hidden some frightening things inside a certain place… Scared out of his wits by his thought, Yao Xintan firmed his conviction again that he would in no way have thoughts of seeking this woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m pretty curious who’re going to be our last three legionnaires.” Jun Man’s appearance was fierce and rough, but his Mandarin was very much fluent. “Our combat unit in addition with Commander Xu might rank top in strength in the whole nation’s Featherwood Guard. Our scout doesn’t need to be dwelled on. If the Reddust Executioners dared to allow Fellow Daoist Zhan Twelve come, they won’t smash up their own reputations. Fellow Daoist Song is the team’s so-called lubricant, and I’m the team’s shield. There is no one better at assaulting defenses than Fellow Daoist Quan. And for heavy firepower, there’s Fellow Daoist Qin…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah…” Qin Xueluan eyed Yao Xintan discreetly. “I’m curious too… For the last three squadmates, will Commander take precedence over support or offensive cultivators?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Wuguo said indifferently, “Compared with these things, I care more about Commander’s true strength.” His warring gaze locked fixedly on the figure on stage. “I really want to know… what kind of scene there’ll be if a man like that completely explodes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone raised a brow. Even the distant Zhan Twelve cast a gaze, as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The past chosen really weren’t cultivators with elysial divine abilities. Sima Gong and Qiu Hong of Ninghai’s five great clans had a special acuity towards qi, but they’d both been rejected by Xu Yangyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s keep on watching.” Gao Wuguo watched the martial stage with rapt attention. “It’s started… Maybe someone will be able to make Commander Xu completely erupt. Bring out his strongest fist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s starting again…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuye’s heart was like a beating drum. He gritted his teeth as he watched the martial stage. In his mind, there were 120 hesitations. In the end, were they going to go up? Or not go up? The past several cultivators with elysial divine abilities had been rejected. He’d also seen with his own eyes what the strength was of a chosen cultivator. Right now… he didn’t have the slightest confidence in the Netherpierce Eye!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Netherpierce Eye could distinguish life and death and could observe fortune and calamity. However… how much weaker were the prior few clans’ divine abilities in comparison to the Netherpierce Eye?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None whatsoever! But they’d still been rejected!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fifth Uncle…” Zhao Ziqi tapped Zhao Wuye. “Are we still going? If we aren’t, let’s go ahead and leave, alright? I-I’m a little scared of Commander…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“NO WAY!” Zhao Wuye didn’t even think and shouted. Once he finished yelling, he felt regret. Presently… he really didn’t risk it. He’d thought beforehand that this Commander Xu was definitely in a position where he excelled past others to be valued importantly by Ancestor Ancientpine. But… he simply hadn’t expected that the other would be so strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Wuye feared… that even late-stage Qi Condensation, an old late-stage Qi Condensation advanced in years, would defeat Xu Yangyi, but was obliged to say that such a feat was rather difficult! His heart was timid. He looked on blankly at the eruption of qi rays on the martial stage, only daring to grab Zhao Ziqi’s hand, but not daring to go forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An hour passed and the eldest daughter of Shanghai’s second-rate Yang Clan, Yang Xueqing, was selected. She herself was almost without hardly any defensive divine abilities, but none could’ve expected that this unassuming woman didn’t even lose out now to her father in the Yang Clan’s Heaven-Earth Thunder Art! Thunderbolts caged the entire martial arena for twenty minutes! They floor had nearly been annihilated, and Xu Yangyi had almost come to an immediate decision regarding her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fierce… Really fierce!” A cultivator below panted heavily, intoxicated by the battle. “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;is a true genius! A genius among geniuses!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe… before I came, I still believed the juniors in my clan could be rated as heaven-defying in talent… but now I know, there’s always a stronger hand…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah… no matter which one, all of them have the promise for Foundation Establishment… Dragons and phoenixes among men!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demon and ghost, both parties mysterious and netherworldly beings. Lightning was their greatest nemesis! Moreover… everyone was also aware that among divine abilities, lightning arts had the greatest might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, over a hundred had flaunted themselves as geniuses, but now there was only room for ten true geniuses! Only ten could remain</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second hour passed, and Zhao Wuye’s hand was grabbing even tighter. His heartbeat was like a drum… because a seemingly seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth was called up. None objected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mo in the south and the Ming in the north. It was said that a minor branch of the Dao of Artificing had paired with the Dao of Talismancy and given rise to Dao of Mecharune Puppets. The north’s Ming Demon Clan could be said to be an inheritance of the most ancient grand puppeteers. As for the south’s Mo Clan, they likewise didn’t lose out to the Ming Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mo Clan was an inheritance since the Hundred Warring Schools era. It could even be assessed as humanity’s grand master in machine techniques! To the extent that it could be said that they were the founder of humanity’s machine arts! The Mo Clan ranked as one of humanity’s seven great apex clans. <span id="footnote-ref-28e0"><a href="#footnote-28e0">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo, Fang, Chen, Wang, Li, Yi, and Ye. Humanity’s seven great cultivation lineages! Even the top three clans of Mo, Ye, and Yi didn’t lose out too much in comparison to the CSIB, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion, and the Featherwood Guard! They lost no more than to the Core Formation ancestors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of puppets a cultivator of the Mo Clan was able to control was determined by rank. In the Qi Condensation realm, an additional puppet could be controlled in each level. This Mo Yeyu was from one of the Mo Clan’s branches. Their branch wasn’t prosperous at all, but Mo Yeyu was able to control one defensive, two offensive, and one detection puppet with the strength of middle-stage Qi Condensation! He could simply be said to be the best jack of all trades in a team!</span></p>

Countless profound runes were inscribed around it. There wasn’t a whisper whatsoever. Like so, the circle emerged suddenly, roughly three to four meters in radius. Everyone looked at this black array in shock. Even Xu Yangyi was a little dazed. However, realization flashed in his mind, and the corner of his mouth soon began to curve.</span></p>

He was still wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and headphones. In the same vein, based on his vacant eyes, it was quite obvious he’d been delivered again without the slightest notice. Ancestor Ancientpine evidently wouldn’t ask in advance if he was willing or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahem… Junior Apprentice-Brother…” Fang Cheng was dazed for a good while and sighed in resignation. He clasped his hands and coughed dryly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Apprentice-Brother.” Xu Yangyi laughed as he returned a greeting. A wisp of fiery heat sparked through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On that day, with Ancestor Ancientpine in attendance, they’d come to complete blows. A clash of divine abilities had surprisingly yielded a Nirvana Void! Xu Yangyi understood very well that the strength of this endearingly silly youth before him was quite possibly no weaker than his own!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Fang Cheng’s assistance, the position of the Xingtian Legion’s final person had been settled in a flash! The audience simply hadn’t paid attention to the duo’s conversation on stage. Everyone present gasped coldly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Twelve snapped his eyes open and deeply eyed Fang Cheng. Afterwards, he shut them.</span></p>

On the surface, he couldn’t make out any depth at all! Only be moving into action would he know if this new arrival was a ferocious lion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is… a Dao-Master Disciple?!” Yao Xintan’s gaze burned hot. “Commander Xu called him senior apprentice-brother.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A Dao-Master Disciple…” Below the stage, the gazes of an unknown number of clans turned fervent. The number of Dao-Master Disciples who traversed the cultivation world could be counted on one’s fingers! Many people only knew the names of Dao-Master Disciples but not their appearances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, there were two in a single outing!

He wanted to see how great the disparity was between similar Dao-Master Disciples. Perhaps… there wasn’t a gap!</span></p>

  <p>1. The forty-nine days/seven nails per each seven days is a custom originating from Buddhism. In Buddhism, the religion believes that the human soul has forty-nine nails keeping it to the human body, so it can’t escape to the afterlife. Buddhist priests hold a ceremony over forty-nine days, removing seven spiritual nails each seven days to free the spirit.
