 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi suspended the medicinal pill high in the air. He still hadn’t spoke, but all of a sudden, an aged figure abruptly stood up from his seat and snarled, “30,000! 30,000 medium-grade spirit stones! It’s mine! No one fight me on this! Give me this face and respect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s gazes immediately looked over and recognized the old man straightaway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”That’s… Grandmaster Fivetastes of the Pill Masters Guild?” Turning his head back to look, a cultivator saw to his amazement an old man whose face was instantly flushed deep-red. The old man was also clenching his fists. The man’s beard was suddenly roving disorderly because of his own qi, floating upwards. This was the old man, whose bearing was mild and gentle like clouds and winds, that the cultivation media outlets were ordinarily unable to contact?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Pill Masters Guild was the guild without the most battle strength in China’s cultivation world, but it was also one of the most esteemed guilds! A cultivator was inseparable from the three great crafts. Although they were called supplementary schools, not a single person dared to belittle them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In approximately two centuries, there had been a total of over a dozen grand masters. The Dao of Crafts started from disciple, journeyman, master, and then finally grand master. The level of preciousness that these dozen-plus people supplied to the cultivation paths of China’s million cultivators was a small aspect that led to the greater whole!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, among these dozen-plus people, there were a total of three master pill-elixirists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandmaster Fivetastes, Grandmaster Insomnia, and Grandmaster Knowledge.” A cultivator said wistfully, “I really didn’t expect that one of them would actually rush over here in person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandmaster Fivetastes and Grandmaster Insomnia are the founders of the Pill Masters Guild. Why didn’t Grandmaster Insomnia come?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cultivator at his side laughed, “Grandmaster Knowledge is a specially hired professor of Heavens Law. It’s understandable that he didn’t come. But…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them glanced at each other. A grand master had actually stood up now and said with his own mouth that he wanted to buy this medicinal pill? And furthermore named a price of 30,000 medium-grade spirit stones? There was something fishy about this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it’s Grandmaster Fivetastes.” Many people faced towards the long-haired and bearded old man and cupped their hands. These words caused Grandmaster Fivetastes to almost jump up to his feet in anxiety!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you know how precious this medicinal pill is?” A seemingly ordinary cultivator who Grandmaster Fivetastes could be considered fairly familiar with said, his laughter radiant like springtime. “Grandmaster, you didn’t make a move for the last several pills, so why are you suddenly shouting out a massive price?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it be that it’s different from the other pills?” An old unacquainted cultivator smiled as he cupped his hands and said. “I’ve heard that ancient cultivators had a hobby called pill hoarding? Might this be the issue?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Bountiful Treasures Pavilion’s 30,000 spirit stones just now was to plant a seed with the pill master and declare their positions. We’re not at the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion’s level of richness, but Grandmaster Fivetastes, you’ve actually bid a price of 30,000 this time without hesitation?” A cultivator pursed their lips and contemplated. Likewise, there wasn’t anyone that could refute Grandmaster Fivetastes’s honor and respect. Instead, he “tactfully” laughed, “Young friend Xu, why does this medicinal pill have to be auctioned alone?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of you get lost!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At this moment, Grandmaster Fivetastes’s eyes were on the edge of erupting with flame! He too was a cultivator of many years. At this time, he understood quite well that he should’ve silently taken action. With his prestige as Grandmaster Fivetastes, there weren’t too many that could refute him. The capital in his hands was also substantial, but the instant he saw this medicinal pill, he was absolutely unable to contain himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Monarch, Minister, Assistant, and Envoy. He’d read these phrases, which had been left behind in a few ancient alchemy texts, aware of their characteristics. With a mere first glimpse, he promptly recognized the origin of this medicinal pill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Minister pill… It was actually a Minister pill! Three imperceptible pill marks, in his eyes, they were akin to great ocean waves in both elegance and magnificence. At that moment, his head was abuzz, and he bounded up to his feet without hesitation, shouting without almost any consideration!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s nothing. This pill… Hehehe…” Fivetastes laughed wryly and forced himself to school his features, dully heaping a weak smile on his face. “This pill… and I… are fated…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hand stroking his beard was somewhat trembling, and while his voice was as serene as possible, he was betrayed by his fixed gaze. That gaze was poised directly at Xu Yangyi.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t say it… By all that is good, don’t say it…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next second, he seemed to hear a crack. His beautiful dream had been shattered into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a Minister pill.” Right now, Xu Yangyi was ignoring all other gazes. He looked at everyone and laughed sincerely. “As to the specifics I don’t know much. I only know that when my friend entrusted this pill to me, he said that this pill is condensed with all his present attainments in the quintessence of Pill Dao. The price might possibly be a bit more expensive than the other pills.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words caused everyone’s eyes to ignite with fiery light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t known who, but the “all his present attainments” and “quintessence of Pill Dao” in addition to Grandmaster Fivetastes lost of self-control just now, incurred the first price bid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“35,000 spirit stones!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Fivetastes’s hand massaged his forehead. Careless… This carelessness had led to him vying over the final opportunity with the present crowd!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“40,000 spirit stones.” He shouted this figure, gnashing his teeth in fury. To him, Grandmaster Fivetastes, this pill HAD to be won!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the presence of true Pill Dao, he suddenly realized how funny his so-called Pill Masters Guild was. It was fastened with the word “pill”, but in the end, it wasn’t a pill. He also had the self-confidence that even if others weren’t able to analyze it, he certainly could!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“100,000.” This shouted bid simply wasn’t a gradual increase but rather the height of a fierce whirlwind! Moreover, there wasn’t the faintest sign of it dropping!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who?!” Just as he had shouted 43,000, an old cultivator was smashed almost dumb by this hundred thousand! “Is this a random bid?! This is the highest standard auction in China! Which clan here can mobilize a hundred thousand medium-grade spirit stones in liquid capital?!” His voice discharged through the floor like rolling thunder, yet he discovered a cultivator at his side was yanking on his sleeve, giving him a meaningful look with the utmost effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let go!” the old cultivator shouted angrily, “This Throne is is unconvinced! Even the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion isn’t capable of transferring a hundred thousand medium-grade spirit stones in liquid capital at once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clan Elder…” The cultivator at his side was almost on the verge of crying. “J-Just n-now, the person who bidded 100,000 is… is…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old cultivator calmed down and suddenly discovered… something was wrong! Completely wrong! After that bid of a hundred thousand, all noise seemed to recede in a flash. Moreover, the voice from moments ago appeared to be...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chatter, chatter…” His teeth couldn’t help but clack, and cold sweat drenched his body without the slightest control. Resembling a machine, his neck craned upwards to the sky, and he saw the black pavilion above him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Core Formation! A Core Formation ancestor had taken action for the first time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The auction floor was absolutely quiet. From the beginning, this voice had spoke several times. Were it not for the massive skeletal hand that had shockingly emerged before their eyes, no one would know this Core Formation ancestor’s voice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” In the black pavilion, a wizened voice said indifferently, “Is a hundred thousand a lot?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A-Ancestor, forgive my offense…” Presently, the old cultivator was already bowing at a ninety-degree angle, his sweat pouring like rain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Fivetastes’s eyes soon reddened. He was neither standing where he was but nor was he sitting down.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is a three-mark Minister pill! Look at the color and luster of the three marks on its surface from shallowness to depth! It’s a magnificent view! Like it was cast from heaven! THIS is a true grand master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, he suddenly felt that the path he hadn’t traversed was still distant, far too long. Nonetheless, now that a Core Formation ancestor had come to seize his beloved with a blade, how could he take it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Dao Master is just gathering interest, nothing else. Everyone…” the wizened voice said leisurely, “why not continue?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their hearts, everyone dared to be angry, but dared not voice this sentiment. A Core Formation Dao Master without sect, clan, or misgiving could naturally put forth a hundred thousand spirit stones, but them? Did they risk following through?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Fivetastes gritted his teeth, faced the sky above, and bowed. “Senior, Daomaster Skybearer said the first five pills wouldn’t be moved against. Why must you insist on this medicinal pill, sir?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wizened voice seemed to sneer. “I know of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandmaster Fivetastes, and yet…” he paused, “the fact is that you are a grand master of pill elixir!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know…” His voice seemed to sink into his memories. “I have never consumed a pill elixir!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe that none of the other presiding Core Formation ancestors have, either!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Once the Queen Mother of the West’s peach has been tasted, its sweeter honey-water, flesh, and greater formliness does not end.” He laughed cruelly, “Thus, your honor is nothing before me.” <span id="footnote-ref-5163"><a href="#footnote-5163">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although this pill master can only make Qi Condensation medicinal pills, it is right that I grant him this honor. What harm is there in a hundred thousand spirit stones for a single pill?” A wisp of cold and gloomy spiritual sense swept over Grandmaster Fivetastes. The grand master shivered uncontrollably and then heard a voice say nonchalantly, “I forgive your guilelessness. Withdraw.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly, there wasn’t one refute from the other Core Formation ancestors. Ordinarily able to call the wind and summon the rain, Grandmaster Fivetastes tasted the flavor of defeat for the first time after making his name. It was also the first time someone had said in front of a grand craftmaster:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You are unqualified. Step back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, among the present Core Formation ancestors, none had consumed a medicinal elixir! In their years, even if their luck was burdened in the long distant Qi Condensation realm, they were still able to scrounge up a few cheap medicinal pills. As for the even cheaper medicinal pills, pill elixirs were still in no way comparable! There were even some ancestors that had mounted the sovereign throne of Core Formation with the aid of a medicinal pill! This was also the reason they cared so much this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandmaster Fivetastes complexion reddened and paled. He wanted to refute this, yet it was beyond his ability to do so. After an extended period, he took a long sigh and bowed deeply towards the bottle in Xu Yangyi’s hand, sitting down in silence. Upon seeing Grandmaster Fivetastes who they ordinarily beseeched for a bottle of excellent pill elixir from and couldn’t obtain, a trace of determination flashed through countless people’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The heavens will change…” An old woman narrowed her eyes and said, “With the Pill Dao’s emergence, there’s no life anymore for pill elixirs and capsules. We can’t deny they’ve assisted the cultivation world for these two centuries, but times are changing… Like the ancient cultivators, without adapting, there is only elimination in the end…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After fifty years… perhaps these two most profitable industries of pill elixirs and capsules will vanish from history…” a youthful-looking cultivator sighed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This interlude wasn’t merely the pouring of a basin of cold water, but instead the dousing of a gasoline barrel! Akin to mild clouds and gentle winds, the floor below was in fact already blazing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I pay my respects to the Dao Masters.” At this time, Xu Yangyi’s voice echoed and he said, “The Dao Masters need not be worried, there is still another Minister pill.” These brief words caused everyone to sigh in relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several seconds of silence, the voice from the black pavilion said again, “A Minister pill, eh… Truly an old name… The Core Formation pill that I took back in that year was no more than an Assistant pill… Never mind it, continue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At almost the same time, the seemingly beaten Grandmaster Fivetastes immediately stood up with a whoosh! This time, he no longer masked his zealotry, as if the taunting of moments ago was mist passing the eye. His entire body and his white beard that reached his waist flew up and danced in the sky, and he bellowed, “60,000! 60,000 medium-grade spirit stones! And an additional ten late-stage Qi Condensation to late-stage Core Formation pill formulas! Who among you has more pill formulas in their hands than this old man?! I treasure this pill highly! I admit it!”</span></p>
