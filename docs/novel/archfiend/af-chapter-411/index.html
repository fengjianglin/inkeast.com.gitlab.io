 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At almost the same time, a pair of eyes opened in awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened to me?” Moonless stared at his hands, lost in thought. He seemed to experience a great dream, even his mind hazy and indistinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where is this place?” He took a step forward and looked all around in doubt. Over a dozen tall stone buddhas stood in his vicinity, and each one held a person in their palm. However, everyone else was sleeping and only he had awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did a quick scan, but surprisingly discovered that one person was missing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi had vanished!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless, he wasn’t permitted more time to his thoughts. In the next second, he violently clutched at his head. Numerous thoughts rushed into his brain, as if… someone was taking another’s thoughts and life, and stuffing them into his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at the same time… his realm unexpectedly fell with great speed! In less than ten minutes, he had become initial-stage Foundation Establishment! Furthermore, his cultivation was continuing to decline!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“ARGH!!!” He was no longer able to contain himself, rearing his head back and screaming. His mind seemed to be torn apart, and agonizing pain, such pain that originated from the depths of his soul, forced him let out a blood-curdling screech.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fang…” His gaze was somewhat red, and he stiffly went through the different memories in his mind. “Fang… Fang Cheng? Who… Who is this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t see, but at this moment, an incredibly sacred rune was slowly brightening where his heart was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Something… is calling me?” He pressed down on his skull that was threatening to crack open, and stared down. “Down there… underneath… something’s just opened…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, in deep space, everything was nearly warping. There only existed a thick iron chain floating within. The entire space was like a kaleidoscope laid flat, ceaselessly whirling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And in this endless space… a massive figure was forging ahead at lightning speed! Its form resembled a tadpole’s, giant mouths covered its entire body, and it had hundreds of red eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Plumes of black mist curled around its body, and creaking sounds occasionally rang out. The mist hit its skin like lightning, and the sound of metal echoed uninterruptedly. Rippling breadths of blue light were reflected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?!” All of a sudden, the tadpole’s countless eyes stared fixedly above. “Someone’s arrived… It’s Wolfbane… He can actually enter the second level?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I… have to speed up… The Dream Walker… cannot fall into anyone else’s hands!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It can only be mine… This Throne… All of it belongs to me, Horseplague! Because… we, ourselves, are one body in the same!” <span id="footnote-ref-3fd4"><a href="#footnote-3fd4">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In kind, in another identical space, yet it was vertical, a three-eyed spirit ape-puppet was plummeting down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its speed was fast. Due to high-speed friction, endless fire was generated, and along with these flames… rays of golden light were released from the puppet’s entire body! Oddly though, the single golden hair on its head began to gradually petrify in the wake of this golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really didn’t expect it…” the Realm Spirit’s voice was rueful, “Only a carrier medium can take me in… I only needed him to bring me… I didn’t expect that he would actually obtain Enihilus’s recognition…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The second door’s been open… How many years has it been? No one can enter the second level… even I don't know what's there… Where is the Dream Walker’s body…? This time, two Foundation Establishment cultivators surprisingly made it in…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” The puppet’s eyes saucered wide, and it said doubtfully, “I still feel… another Foundation Establishment… His mass… is around 200 meters in size?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am I mistaken? He’s actually in the second level, too? How did he get in? This is impossible, who else knows the way to enter the second level besides me? Fellow Daoist Wolfbane gained Enihilus’s approval… so what about him?! How did he get in?! Who is he?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After ages, the puppet took a deep breath as if it was human and closed it eyes. “There’s something else… something ominous… something very old… that somehow managed to get mixed in…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a following haze, Xu Yangyi appeared in nothingness. Even though his protective qi cover promptly activated, he took in everything in front of him vigilantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This space was warping…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black hole appeared to be in the middle. From his position, he could see a vast number of stone fragments slowly drifting around. Although they moved slowly, their course was unswerving, and they migrated towards the center in a curve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blackness. Deep darkness. However, there was nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the endless dark, an infinitely long and coarse chain was fluttering through space. It had no beginning and no end, as if it had no origin or conclusion, like it was established in this space for eternity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t see this limitless chain. Instead, he cast his senses, and a flash of ecstasy quickly bubbled up on his face!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Clearcloud Realm’s rules… had been broken!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now’s the time…” He didn’t hesitate for a second, and closed his eyes shut. A sensation he hadn’t felt for a long time, the feeling of the body and qi uniting as one, spontaneously arose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the top of his head, a pillar of golden light surged up, as if it was bridge linking heaven and man. All of his long-silent spiritual force came to a loud boil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh… Swoosh…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Azure qi swelled in his meridians, qi that he had restrained for ten years. The lid had been opened, and the billowing feeling caused him to feel some apprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At once, his spiritual sense dove into his qi sea. In the past, his spiritual sense was shaped like a misty human, but only now did it coalesce into a human-shaped figure of sparkling golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the instant his spiritual sense gathered, he felt a few different things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual force within him was suddenly empty. Afterwards, his entire qi sea began to surge. In front of him, a transparent but incredibly simple-feeling barrier formed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… is the Foundation Establishment bodily limiter.” Xu Yangyi gazed at the barrier facing him. After Qi Condensation, the Foundation Establishment limiter became harder and harder to break through. Using his eyes, he could see that the wall lacked any fanciness. Once he used his spiritual sense to observe it, though, he immediately discovered there were runes scrawled over it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a wall of invisible runes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll just have to see if the Foundation Establishment limiter can stop me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Rocjourney came, he saw that Xu Yangyi was sitting cross-legged in the void, and that the demon slayer’s body was glimmering with vast azure light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… is a breakthrough?” Rocjourney fell into a sudden daze. Previously, he’d felt that Xu Yangyi wasn’t too far from middle Foundation Establishment, but he’d never expected that the other would actually break through here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the next moment, fury rushed out from his stomach in a breath. He stomped forward a couple steps with rounded eyes, but came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He actually dares break through?! He actually dares break through here?! Who gave him the courage? Is breaking through the bodily limiter so easy?! Advancing a minor boundary now… If this idiot takes more than a day… How could I keep him company here for a day!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It takes me a full five days to advance! Even if his talents are greater, it’ll still take that long! Unless he can break the limiter in one attack! A day… Each second is extremely precious right now!!! He might want to die, but I don’t!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His anger had come so intensely, to the extent that his eyes were somewhat reddened. With life and death in the balance, Xu Yangyi had actually still chosen to break through! Regardless, it would be good if Xu Yangyi could swiftly break through. It would be another fraction of a card against the terrible monster that was coming, but… while Qi Condensation could break the bodily limiter very quickly, Foundation Establishment… He practically wanted to grab Xu Yangyi by the throat and shake him awake!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, he didn’t dare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power of Xu Yangyi’s move before was absolute. Disturbing Xu Yangyi as he broke through was equal to seeding mortal hatred. He could only glare daggers at the other with red eyes. His knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You better pray you can break through in a day… or else…” he gnashed his teeth and said, “Even if there’s mortal hatred between us, I’ll definitely block you! You don’t consider the time or place… If the Dream Walker wakes up, I’ll rip you to shreds even if I have to risk my several centuries of cultivation, you idiot! I’ll use your skull to offer sacrifices to my banner!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before his voice even fell, a sharp crack suddenly came from Xu Yangyi’s body. It was like glass had been crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, spiritual light exploded out from his body like a tsunami, quickly sprinkling through the neighboring air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whish!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Rocjourney looked over straightaway, and his eyes snapped wide open. He quickly changed from a seated posture to a standing position, looking at Xu Yangyi in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“ONE hit to break the limiter!!!” After three seconds of silence, Rocjourney’s voice, so intense that it warbled somewhat, instantly resounded through space!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He broke the middle-stage Foundation Establishment limiter in one hit?!” He looked on in amazement at the glass shard-like motes of spiritual light that erupted all around Xu Yangyi. At this moment, within the vast dark space, a rain of spiritual light appeared to sprinkle in front of Xu Yangyi, shining upon Rocjourney’s wide eyes and ajar mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His head seemed to become a machine, stiffly looking at the floating dots of light in the vicinity. Tentatively, he extended his hand. “This… How is this possible… How is this possible?!?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A day?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only a minute!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dots of spiritual lights that his fingertips touched quickly dissipated in his hand. At the same time, a powerful spiritual pressure far stronger than before rumbled out of Xu Yangyi’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rocjourney foolishly looked at the figure seated in the air. Without the slightest omen, admiration, jealousy, disbelief, ecstasy, and various complex feelings rushed up to his heart with a bang. In the shroud of spiritual light dots that spread several dozen meters through the air, he didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside, Xu Yangyi also looked at the shattered limiter with a little shock. His surprise wasn’t that he had broken the limiter in one strike, since that was how he always acted, all the way back initial Qi Condensation. Although the Foundation Establishment bodily limiter was difficult, perhaps the reason was because he practiced A Thousand Li Invincible. Still, he hadn’t reached the stage that could block him yet, and even bring him to use a pill for limiter breaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His surprise stemmed from the fact that after he broke the limiter… all the qi in his qi sea wildly spun and turned into a giant azure funnel!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The funnel reached for the sky and touched the earth. Winds and clouds were stirred, and like a man in the wilderness, he saw a cyclone holding up the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This azure cyclone gradually ascended. Followingly, all the mist above his head began to slowly revolve, as if something was gathering in the middle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little by little, the originally white mist turned azure in color until a ripple and an azure man-sized water drop emerged in the central cloud cave. The droplet swayed in the air for a few seconds and then dripped into his body in the wake of a sweet-sounding jingle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without warning, an expanse of gentle azure light brightened from down below. Even the misty qi all around trembled, and afterwards… it surprisingly began to slowly liquefy!</span></p>
