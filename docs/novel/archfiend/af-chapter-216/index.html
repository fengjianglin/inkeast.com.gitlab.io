 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 216: Danxia Temple (35)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senior Bloodblade had arrived in his true body! Even though he’d suppressed his realm, Foundation Establishment was Foundation Establishment. Even if his spiritual force could only be used at a Qi Condensation level, his spiritual sense and the divine abilities equipped with his magik treasures could all be used! As for this ancient mirror, it obviously wasn’t an ordinary treasure. Senior Bloodblade was initial-stage Foundation Establishment. A magik treasure that could be used at the initial stage was an absolute rarity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could be said that if they had to fight a single Bloodblade, there was no question that half of them would die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking advantage of the opportunity, Zhao Wuye immediately formed a seal. Ten seconds later, the formation vanished without a trace, and the skylark glared daggers at Zhao Wuye and Mao Ba’er. Qiao Wu was unwilling to leave because he clearly understood that once he left… all that remained was death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he returned, the Nangong Clan wouldn’t let him off in any respect! However, if he stayed, death was still present! He had no thoughts about exchanging moves with a Foundation Establishment expert at all, even if the other was suppressed to the same realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You lot…” A terrible glint flashed through Bloodblade’s eyes. “Could it be that you think me to be already old in years, unable to kill a chicken or slaughter a dog?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s…” Qiao Wu retook his human form. His teeth clenched so hard that a grinding noise echoed. In his heart, there were endless thoughts about extracting the Xingtian Legion’s tendons and pulling out their bones. Regardless, he dared not expressed this sentiment one bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go…” Quan Liu rigidly gritted his teeth. Nangong Xiaoran had already died. The Nangong Clan didn’t have a central pillar. If they stayed here, and since Bloodblade had already interfered, they would only lose their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You two!” A man heard what was said, his expression like earth. He clenched his teeth and said, “Sixth Young Master has died here. When we return…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I said…” Quan Liu enunciated each word through his teeth, “go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No buts!” Qiao Wu clenched his fists so hard that his palms drew blood, and his eyes were dreadfully reddened. “If you want to fight a true realm-suppressed Foundation Establishment Senior, you’re looking to die. I won’t be accompanying you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go…” Quan Liu gnashed his teeth and said lowly, “After we leave… everyone scatter far apart. Never see each other again. The Nangong Clan cannot be returned to any longer. Only like this can we escape with our lives from the ancestor’s hand.” He turned his head and looked at the group. “The earlier we leave, the more advantageous it’ll be for us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one dared to say anything further. Nangong Xiaoran had already died. Returning to the clan and being buried with him was the only road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several hours after entering Danxia Temple’s underside, the sixth young master had been beheaded. The Nangong Clan, one of Five Great Demon Clans, had been the first to be eliminated out of the running.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene was awfully silent. Everyone’s vigilant gazes hovered over Bloodblade’s body. After ages, Bloodblade laughed and looked at Xu Yangyi in satisfaction. “Young friend… I have a couple words to say to you… cough, cough…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi cupped his hands. “Please speak, Senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have come to Danxia Temple in order to find one thing. A spirit medicine recorded in legend that is able to prolong one’s life by a century. I once heard through the grapevine that this item is suspected to exist within Danxia Temple. You and I will take it together. What do you think of this deal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His mouth spoke of business, yet his mirror quietly shined over Zhao Wuye’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi laughed and clasped his hands. “Whatever Senior instructs, I will naturally follow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I like logical people.” Bloodblade coughed twice and beckoned. Immediately, Nangong Xiaoran’s storage ring flew into Xu Yangyi’s hand. His thin face covered in wrinkles, he smirked. “This item… I present it to you as a greeting gift… cough, cough…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi didn’t take a look to see what was inside the storage ring. His face was respectful, yet he sneered in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mao Ba’er had said that Bloodblade was in no way a good samaritan. This present business further illustrated that he wasn’t the virtuous kind at all! He was making Xu Yangyi help him find an item, and while he evidently fancied the Xingtian Legion, the group was merely assisting him and nothing more. He wouldn’t help the Xingtian Legion take anything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the “down payment”, it was the storage ring of Nangong Xiaoran who Xu Yangyi had slain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other’s approach was very clear. Help had to be rendered. No help, then I’ll have to ask you to eternally rest here. And as for whether the Xingtian Legion was willing or not?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A jest. A Foundation Establishment cultivator compared to a Qi Condensation cultivator was a difference of heaven and earth, old tigers contrasted to rabbits. The tiger ate the rabbit. What need was there to consider the rabbit’s thoughts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone else was unaware of the thoughts within Xu Yangyi’s heart, but the complexion of each person in the vicinity turned a few shades gloomy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a kind of acknowledgment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This old ghost…” Ye Old Four snorted. “So it turned out he was looking for an ally, eh… And here I thought that he truly feared nothing in the world. He came to Danxia Temple without even needing an ally.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amitabha,” Fahui chanted and reined his gaze from Xu Yangyi’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They basically didn’t care about how tyrannical Bloodblade was. They only knew that his current attitude was equal to recognizing that the Xingtian Legion had the qualifications to work together with him. Or perhaps it should be said that they had the qualifications to “help” him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the others—the Ming Clan, the Ye Clan, and the Yi Clan—Bloodblade surprisingly hadn’t taken fancy to them. In the same vein, even the Dao Sect and the Buddhist Monastery weren’t selected. Instead, Bloodblade felt that this Xingtian Legion, which had the lowest strength on paper, was even more of a winning chip!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To those of heaven’s pride who were present, this was a silent but resounding slap to the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior.” Xu Yangyi cupped his hands and said, “But this Heavenmend Stone…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, everyone’s gazes tightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This item…” Bloodblade said indifferently. “Is of no great use to me. At the moment, I am only seeking things to prolong life.” He paused and laughed, “However, leaving it in your care here isn’t bad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This old goon!” The anger in Zhao Wuye’s eyes was jetting out flames. “That’s if he finds a longevity-extending item… He still wants to make off with the Heavenmend Stone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amitabha…” These words gave rise to a chorus of cold snorts. Fahui’s expression was devoid of sorrow or joy, and he said deeply, “What place does Senior put us cultivators who struggled bitterly here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloodblade laughed grimly, “If you’re willing to face me and this Fellow Daoist, don’t hesitate to come try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Sister Nine also stood out. She could permit other things, but such an item like the Heavenmend Stone was something she absolutely couldn’t! Even a few great clans would take this legendary marvel as a divine clan-protector artifact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloodblade might not care for the Heavenmend Stone, only seeking longevity-extending items, but it was impossible for them to disregard this matter whatsoever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She brushed an eye over Xu Yangyi. “Fellow Daoist, are you certain you want to face all the other cultivators with Senior Bloodblade?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi’s gaze flickered. He declined to comment. Furthermore, he had yet to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloodblade’s pupils quietly needled. His mind suddenly flashed, and he promptly realized that he’d made an error.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This little cultivator’s strength was rather good. If Xu Yangyi wasn’t standing at his side later on… and was confronted with so many geniuses by himself…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he’d made absolute preparations for this Danxia Temple excursion, he was set high and lofty in the past. Regarding Qi Condensation cultivators, had he ever once considered them in his eyes? At this moment, his words and conduct were unable to be changed from habit. He had involuntarily made the choice of himself as a “Foundation Establishment cultivator”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Either work for me or die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for what he desired, was it this current group of Qi Condensation cultivators’ turn to voice an opinion?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, he was presently a “Qi Condensation cultivator”. He could only use Qi Condensation qi. If he truly provoked the crowd’s anger, once all these chosen really did join together from each power, they certainly wouldn’t be scared of him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cough, cough…” The idea in his heart suddenly veered. He coughed dryly, sighing deeply in his mind. Were it not for his lifespan already being exhausted, he would do his utmost to seize the Heavenmend Stone. But now, he only wanted to extend his life! All other items were illusory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since that’s how it is…” Stiffly changing directions, he faintly smiled. “I don’t really care for this Heavenmend Stone, but if a longevity-extending item appears…” He paused, and his voice became dark. “If anyone obstructs me, I will be sure to grant that person a death of a thousand cuts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one was in opposition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these grounds, apart from himself, no one cared much about longevity-extending items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case.” Bloodblade glanced at Xu Yangyi. “I’ll tell everyone how to take this treasure… It can also be considered my down payment to everyone for abiding by their promises…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior knows about how to take this treasure?” In a flash, everyone’s eyes brightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps…” Bloodblade grasped his pale beard with his fingers and laughed, “After all, I am a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Although young friends all belong to a great clan, your realms are lacking. There are too many things that your clans wouldn’t tell all of you. As it turns out, I’ve read about how to take the Heavenmend Stone from an ancient tome. I didn’t act just now to also validate whether this treasure confirms or denies my speculation. The fact was verified, as expected.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please clear the confusion, Senior,” Sister Nine laughed. “If Junior finds a longevity-extending item, I will certainly hand it over to Senior.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloodblade laughed, declining to comment. “I like logical people… Everyone, please look around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He pointed towards the surrounding night and said, “Even if it’s night in this place, brightness exists. Everyone’s divine abilities from just now could be said to be a display of vibrant fireworks. But all of you… did you carefully observe the stone’s silhouette?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not waiting for the crowd to answer, he casually beckoned and produced a fireball, approaching the Heavenmend Stone. Xu Yangyi’s gaze shone. Not only him, everyone saw that no matter how the fireball pulsed… the Heavenmend Stone’s shadow didn’t move by a hair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is called a Mirror Formation.” Both of Bloodblade’s hands were tucked in his sleeves, and he said, “From the aforementioned, this Heavenmend Stone essentially cannot be attained because it’s merely…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A shadow cast by a physical object.” Xu Yangyi inhaled deeply. “So that’s to say the shadow underneath is the item itself. The Heavenmend Stone on top is just a shadow? No wonder I couldn’t grab it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bloodblade nodded in admiration. “I chose you, Fellow Daoist Xu. I also believe in my own foresight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He neared the Heavenmend Stone little by little and wordlessly extended his hand. It was a thin and withered arm, and almost all that remained were bony joints. He took a deep breath, and his hand suddenly filled with qi. He fiercely stuck his hand towards the Heavenmend Stone’s shadow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, a bizarre scene occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unexpectedly, his hand pierced straight into the shadow. His expression as usual, he felt around. After a few seconds, he raised a brow and growled, “Rise!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The present scene was dead-quiet. Bloodblade’s hand gradually extended into the shadow. As it extended in by roughly a third, a prismatic light flashed in the shadow without warning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;This light was like an aurora. Pure and clear, not a shred of an impurity was visible! This dot in the night dyed this expanse of heaven and earth with five colors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So light can actually be this bright…” Mao Ba’er greedily sucked in a mouthful of kaleidoscopic radiance. In an instant, his entire body shivered uncontrollably, and he released a kind of lewd faint breathing that a dog couldn’t possibly make. “Ahhh~ Hubby~ So good~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one paid him any attention. Right now, no one had the effort to cast their gaze on him. Their gazes like fire, everyone was watching Bloodblade’s arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the wake of Bloodblade’s arm gradually returning to its original length, the prismatic light below was cut apart from the shadow’s darkness sliver by sliver. It almost took the shape of a five-colored, palm-sized fountain!</span></p>
