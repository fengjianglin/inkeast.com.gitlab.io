 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“AAAHHH!!!” A mournful wail rang out. In normal circumstances, it would’ve terrified one so much that they wouldn’t be able to peacefully sleep at night. But now, not a single billow was roused. This was because wretched cries rose and fell over and over in the vicinity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each person… was without bones. Even Yi Old Five wasn’t an exception. He fell to the ground and rolled. Only the two great sects of Buddhism and Daoism protected their bodies. At this moment, the lotus sea was filled with cultivators screaming and shrieking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You better hurry up and think of something.” Suddenly, a woman’s voice rang out. “Otherwise, all of us will will die here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi raised his head and looked. Somewhat unexpectedly, the woman in front of him hadn’t been affected. However, understanding dawned on him in a wink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quan Ningyue had an innate Nine Yins Extreme bloodline. In order to save her, Grand Artificer Gao Muya had transformed half of her into a mecharune puppet. Devour Bone didn’t have the slightest effect on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He nodded towards Quan Ningyue, and his gaze tightly locked onto Wei Zhongxian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst curling black qi, Wei Zhongxian seemed like a demon-god of hell. However, what caused Xu Yangyi to take special note was Wei Zhongxian’s soaring black qi… It didn’t weaken by a sliver!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenly…” At this time, a voice like the Nine Nethers rang out again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gasp…” Fahui suddenly lifted up his head and looked several thousand meters away in shock. Already in the air, Wei Zhongxian, whose five limbs were separated by no less than tens of meters, was floating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was more… There was actually still more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heart was a frigid expanse. Yes… just now had been the First Erosion. There was also a second… perhaps a third… or even… nine! Ten! Was he… capable of enduring?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Buddha bless and protect me…” For the first time, his voice was shaky. He closed his eyes and the speed of his sutra chanting became faster and faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The faces of Greenwall’s Three Swords were like earth. Xuan Chengzi didn’t utter a second word, and a sword slashed open the artery of his left hand. Immediately, blood rushed forth like a fountain! Blood droplets entered the oil lamp, and the lantern fire became a shade brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Opening…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi took a deep breath and quickly yelled, “Fellow Daoists! What are you still waiting for?! Are you sitting here and waiting for death?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only the four of us can move here! Can you pull through?” With the gaze of a wolf, he turned his head and glared at the devil-god-like Wei Zhongxian who was floating in the air. He fiercely licked his lips. “Initial-stage Foundation Establishment… It’s only initial-stage Foundation Establishment! It’s not even really a living person! He’s the same as a machine! Just a real zombie! What the hell is there to be scared of?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“C’mon, maybe we can still gamble on a path of survival…” His hand beckoned, and Falling Moon welcomed the wind and came forth. In a flash, the sky was filled with black flame. Xu Yangyi said lowly, “If we don’t go… death will be the only road!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone.” He clasped his hands. “I’m going!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation presented by Wei Zhongxian’s divine ability was clear in a flash. If he wanted to obtain the Animus Armament, not taking down the corpse was simply impossible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the might of this foe’s divine ability… greatly transcended everyone’s imaginations! It was unlike a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s divine ability at all! Now… wasn’t the time to desire the Animus Armament. Instead, there was a chance that all of them would meet their demise here if they didn’t kill a bloody path out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!!!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Xu Yangyi’s figure drew an afterimage. Shouldering boundless valor, he slashed directly at Wei Zhongxian’s skull!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You’ve been dead already for several hundred years. I’ll send you back again today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Second…” The third word had already been spat out. But in this instant, it was completely different from the prior move! The surroundings started to become chillingly cold! The air temperature was so low that it left one in disbelief!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Amitabha…” Xu Yangyi’s swiftly darting silhouette was reflected in Fahui’s eyes. The young monk closed his eyes, and as he opened them, his battle spirit was ignited again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes… so it was. What kind of geniuses were they?! If they didn’t fight and kill for a future, how could this path of cultivation be walked?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This poor monk came to Danxia Temple fully aware. I know very well that you’re a Foundation Establishment cultivator—an old ghost from centuries ago—how can I not slay you?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t expected that Xu Yangyi would attack with full power. Besides, surviving would further justify his heart tribulation. In this place, in Danxia Temple, his heart devil had to be resolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In case he slayed this corpse puppet of Wei Zhongxian, the only person who could help him succeed… was Xu Yangyi alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice yet to fall, Fahui had already disappeared. In the next second, he was holding onto the lotus lantern in his mouth, but his left hand took out a finger bone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This finger bone emitted a Buddhist light that filled the sky. Golden talismans floated around its surroundings. Evidently, this was an almighty magik treasure that the Shaolin Temple had given to Fahui!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well said… Well said!” Ling Xiaozi’s eyes burst with vigor. “How can we sword-cultivators lack a sword-cultivator’s drive?! Evil devils are to be slain. Fiends are to be slain. Heart tribulations are also to be slain!” He slapped the crown of his head, and a golden sword-core suddenly emerged. Body and sword united, transforming into a resplendent streak. It closely followed Xu Yangyi and raced forth like electricity!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To this day, I have thought myself to be Xiang Yu. I will NOT cross over to Jiangdong! If we can’t hold on against this divine ability, what meaning is there in even struggling at death’s door?!” <span id="footnote-ref-c076"><a href="#footnote-c076">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, six glorious sword-lights streaked across this world’s black clouds and charged straight at Wei Zhongxian who was several thousand meters away. Xu Yangyi took the lead. Behind was Fahui, Ling Xiaozi, Xuan Chengzi, and Qing Jingzi. Last was the middle-stage Qi Condensation Quan Ningyue!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing an old Foundation Establishment monster who was able to flip his hand and exterminate a hundred Qi Condensation, five late-stage Qi Condensation and one middle-stage Qi Condensation, the two super sects’ disciples and an A-rank Legion issued a direct challenge!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six rays of spirit light carried a relentless momentum. Arrows fired from a bow didn’t need to turn back. They burned away their paths of retreat, sinking boats and breaking cauldrons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ten Cardinals Red Lotus… Azure Dragons Seeks Cauldron!” Xu Yangyi glared daggers at the demonic Wei Zhongxian who was in the air. Falling Moon in his right hand, an expanse of black flame was born. His left hand was saturated by the all-penetrating glow of red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fahui bit into his lantern, and a holy golden-white color appeared on his lone arm’s middle finger. Four vague and solemn words were gravely uttered from his mouth. “Finger Snap Divine Might!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three sword-cores of Greenwall’s Three Swords converged into a golden ray. Voices brimming with murderous aura, the trio furiously roared in unison! “Origin Returns To Genesis!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Quan Ningyue’s hands spread open again. Two heart-chilling blue glints brightened, and she snarled, “Spirit Extermination Cannon!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Action had been taken without the slightest reservation. All of them killing moves! These were all their killing aces! A task accomplished in a single stroke! If they weren’t successful, they would die valiantly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They weren’t fools that shouted out when they attacked. Instead… this time, there was only blood and heat in their hearts! This rallying cry was for their own proper names! To boost their own morale! Or perhaps… it was the battle cry that they left in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These few people were even more understanding of Foundation Establishment’s might than the bystanders!
