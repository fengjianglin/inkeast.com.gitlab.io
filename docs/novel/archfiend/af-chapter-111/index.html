 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can be mad later. The higher-ups said to follow strictly according to question and answer, not one sentence more.” Zheng’s manager sighed, “Zheng, these words were passed down from Deputy Provincial Governor Zhao’s secretary this time. I don’t know why our show’s attracted a high official’s attention, but all I know is that if you don’t talk this way, we’re going to have to head back, pack our things, and beat it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Song was taciturn. Eventually, he coldly snorted, “Manager Zhang, haven’t you checked out what’s his background? His reputation is too frickin’ green, not to mention which moneybag’s brat he is.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I haven’t.” Manager Zhang pushed on his glasses and said in confusion, “I just wonder… This Xu Yangyi, from his looks to his height to his build, he really is a good talent taken into the entertainment circle. But it’s just that his background can’t be found…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can’t be found? He doesn’t have a management company? A performing arts background? At the very least, he should have someone who recommended him into this social circle, right?!” Zheng Song’s temper wasn’t minor. Upon hearing these words, his anger suddenly became greater, and he slammed a table and yelled, “There’s never been anyone who’s entered the entertainment circle that HASN’T been advertised! He’s gotta have a manager, right? The company he’s part of can’t be investigated?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No… I didn’t say that…” Manager Zhang seemed a bit scared. Walking over in front of the door and twisting the handle, he said softly, “I said… that even this person’s birth, birthday, and any background he had before showbiz can’t be found… It’s a blank space… It’s just like, just like…” he pursed his lips, his voice low, “this guy came outta nowhere.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zheng Song’s temper was big, he was no fool. Not only was it confined to Manager Zhang, but when even he heard these words, he was quelled from amidst hot rage in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Someone’s protecting him?” Zheng Song stood up, pacing left and right. After a while, he furrowed his brows and said, “Does he have a special identity? No, no, no, Manager Zhang, aren’t we thinking too much? With this kind of status, what’s this guy even come to our cast and crew to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course there’s something up.” A voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who is it?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The door that was just shut opened, soundless and without warning. Around 1.9 meters tall with a head of choppy locks, a man in a suit was followed in by four young men and women, directly opening the door and walking in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he wore a suit, he had no necktie, and his buttons were casually left wide open. Zheng Song couldn’t see what was the suit’s brand, and the shirt brand moreover couldn’t be made out. It appeared as if the other had thrown on his clothes just as he pleased and walked out like so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But on the contrary, the hair of the men and women behind him were styled in exceptional closeness to their own temperaments, the brands on their suits at worst valued at tens of thousands of Chinese dollars per article of clothing. At a glance, Zheng Song, who was part of the entertainment circle, could see that a girl’s brooch was the latest model that had just been recently released last month from a famous designer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Zhao.” Manager Zhang’s eyes shone, immediately recognizing a man among them. The movie shoot in Mingshui Province this time had borrowed the Four Great Joint Pools’s surroundings and also Zhao Yuanjing’s many contacts. Prompt, he bowed and laughed, “Sir, why have you come?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nonetheless, Zhao Yuanjing didn’t even glance at him. He laughed towards a tall youth at the lead and said, “It’s for them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For us? What did we do wrong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Manager Zhang’s heart suddenly grew nervous. Among youths, entertainment companies were mighty on the surface, but in reality he knew of his own business. If some province wanted to stop them, the province could call out as they pleased, enough to cause them no end in headaches. Especially Zhao Yuanjing, a true heir of political prestige.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If something really did happen, he wouldn’t be able to take responsibility for it at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Zhao, how is it that you have time?” Thinking of this, Manager Zhang immediately spurred his mind to maximum overdrive, abruptly sending a few good meaningful looks to Zheng Song. Heaping a sincere smile across his entire face, he promptly stood up and beckoned everyone to sit. “Everyone, please sit. You’re all honored guests. All of you are noble visitors. Wait a moment, I’ll brew some coffee right away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No need.” The tall man sat down on the sofa, crossing one leg over the other as if he was the host. His hand was on the sofa as he looked at the ceiling. “I was afraid you wouldn’t recognize me, so I specifically called over a few people that you would.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was besides the point! However, none dared to say no! Without the desire to introduce himself, this young man waltzed in as if he was the master. The silk-pants aura that laid on his body simply didn’t need to be seen—it could be smelled. Moreover, this man held no intention of responding to Manager Zhang and Zheng Song, posing question and taking answer himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Manager Zhang was wet with cold sweat. What was the spin on this? His eyes unconsciously sized up the person who had come. He was all too understanding of the unique personalities that flowed in society. As for the people who had come, regardless of their temperaments, clothes, and seeming mildness of clouds and gentleness of winds, Manager Zhang immediately knew that each person sitting here was either a prince or princess of Mingshui Province.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Especially this one…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;His gaze involuntarily fell on the young man who was sitting by himself on a three-person-wide sofa. No one dared to sit together with him! Not even Zhao Yuanjing dared! His palm was slick with cold sweat. Zhao Yuanjing was the son of Deputy Governor Zhao… This...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of his eyes twitched, and he saw Zheng Song’s gaze. Zheng Song was full of questions; he didn’t recognize a single one of these people. Manager Zhang promptly made an effort to signal with his eyes a few time. Among these sitting people… a mere Zhao Yuanjing could cause their movie team to hover between the lines of life and death. Even if a famous director was overseeing production, what of it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Chu was afraid you wouldn’t learn of this matter, so he came here specifically to make a trip.” Zhao Yuanjing laughed, “Mr. Zhang, originally, you came to my approach to make an inquiry concerning a scenic area, so you could shoot a picture. I’m here to give you a word. You must remember at all costs not to say one wrong word tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If said, your crew and cast will be taken away.” Chu Zhaonan waved his hand indifferently. It was nothing more than a production and filming crew. A famous director? What was that? Not to mention his grandfather, his own father was still governing Mingshui Province.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;If this matter is done well, I’ll allow you to continue shooting. If not, the hell you still here for? Isn’t that an eyesore? Over a hundred million invested? How is that damn business my concern?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Manager Zhang’s sweat quickly dripped down. Who the heck was this person? How was he so tyrannical? This was a film that Huayi Broadcasting Corp had invested over a hundred million into! Close to 200 million in Chinese dollars! His crews would be taken away just because of this young man’s word?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze landed on Zhao Yuanjing. He didn’t expect only to see the other unhurriedly light a cigarette and laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Didn’t you hear clearly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I got it…” Manager Zhang immediately answered. Zheng Song who was at the side had long since become dumbstruck, his eyes wide and his mouth foolish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What the fuck was going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell your actor to control his mouth. Otherwise, he won’t be getting out of Mingshui Province.” Chu Zhaonan glanced at the stunned Zheng Song, furrowing his brows in dislike. How sharp was a cultivator’s five senses? Long before he entered, he had heard Zheng Song’s rambling. For him to converse properly with the other could already be considered an achievement of Heavens Law’s teachings. On the airplane, he had sent everyone that he didn’t favor on their ways with a kick. Him not directly kicking Zheng Song was honestly because the other couldn’t rouse his interest.&nbsp;</span></p>

I understand!” Manager Zhang replied in haste, simply uncaring for the sudden reddening and blackening of Zheng Song’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was this? Wasn’t this too much of a silk pants? Ordinary silk pants absolutely wouldn’t be able to speak of such blunt threat. Everyone would bear smiles and pass the knife in secrecy, however, Chu Zhaonan was different. The thoughts of cultivators and ordinary people didn’t exist on parallel lines. And regarding he himself…&nbsp;</span></p>

They didn’t have this qualification.&nbsp;</span></p>

Tomorrow, the boss’s arranged task truly couldn’t run into a mishap.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yuanjing was stunned. “I forgot. I’ll mail it to him.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Manager Zhang, who the heck are they?!?!?!” A moment later, Zheng Song’s furious voice rang out, “How awesome is he!? Who does he think he is?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not who…” Manager Zhang complicatedly looked towards the entrance and gritted his teeth. “One of them was the son of Deputy Provincial Governor Zhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...” Zheng Song immediately went mute. Even if he was more popular, in comparison to the children of such political noblesse, he still didn’t have the courage to provoke them. The duo didn’t speak, but in their hearts, they oddly pondered something together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was it at the lead?</span></p>

No… This wasn’t important. So many people had been moved to action, and it appeared he hadn’t even said two remarks, but as long as a man of such status made an appearance, standing in front of them was the best warning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention them, even their chairman would also have to keep a smile as he listened here! Chu Zhaonan hadn’t elected to make a call but rather chose to personally go on a trip. Although his words were few, his bearing was very much evident!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that case… a problem had arrived. Were they to escort tomorrow’s person like an emperor or a naval guard? What was the status… of the person they were unable to investigate any risings and fallings of?</span></p>

The appointed interview was to be conducted here.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hello, you guys are?” Xu Yangyi shook hands and asked.</span></p>

This feeling… The other didn’t even remember who they were?</span></p>

He’s the actor Zheng Song, and I’m his manager. This lowly one is surnamed Zhang.” Manager Zhang dared not to expose a trace of a discontent smile and quickly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi nodded and made an inviting gesture. The three people sat down on the sofa. This was Mingshui Province’s video-recording studio. Many interview programs had been carried out here. Less than five minutes later, a woman entered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the hostess of Mingshui Province’s currently popular program ‘Performing Arts Collective’, Liu Yurao. This is specifically for our interview. She was once the anchor of a special program for the supernatural, ‘Solving Secrets’.” Peony’s gentle voice rang out at the side of Xu Yangyi’s ear. “In addition… your interview video will be released to the Cultivation Eye Video Network. They bid a broadcast cost of three medium-grade spirit stones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why didn’t you tell me in advance?” Xu Yangyi smiled as he slightly tilted his head and said quietly.</span></p>

Sir, your clicks should be pretty high. There’s also the benefit of promoting your image.” Peony laughed as she answered, “Commander, there’s a great difference in building a contacts network in the cultivation world than in the past. In an era where the internet is prompt in delivery and acquisition, even China Cloud’s and the CSIB’s rankings rely on the internet. Web visualization surpasses all other mediums.”</span></p>
