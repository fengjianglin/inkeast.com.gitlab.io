Afterwards, at the end of last year, the four major powers: Heavens Law, the CSIB, the Featherwood Guard, and the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion, formally took charge of full responsibility for the incident together.</span></p>

In total, 12,342 people participated. Among them was Nantong Province’s 130 cultivation families, in total 342 people. In addition, there were 12,000 guests. The number of Heavens Law graduates numbered 62. Each city’s champion totaled thirteen people. After the end of the Qualifier, Vermilion Snow suddenly killed her way in. This has led to an unprecedented, overwhelming incident in China’s past five decades.&nbsp;</span></p>

They did so without qualm as true cultivators. Through the Chinese government’s Deputy Energy Minister, Mr. Chu Tianyi’s, suggestion, they were posthumously recognized as martyrs, and the families of these eight cultivators were arranged for by the government. Those who had families were automatically upgraded a level. Their children and younger generations will get to enjoy a tuition-free education at Heavens Law and will moreover have the privilege to select an occupation among the Big Three. Fengyi City’s Heavens Law branch has already erected a heroes monument.</span></p>

Strength, only strength was number one. Even now, a burning expectation had arose in his heart regarding the Eternal Alchemy Canon.&nbsp;</span></p>

As one of their authorities, Vermilion Snow had ranked early on as one of the Myriad Demons Palace’s elders. Moreover, Old Demon Blackmount specially declared during a news conference last year on New Year’s Day: he wouldn’t cover up this event by any means, and they would even search for her. Daomaster Mountainruler revealed himself for the first time in two centuries and furthermore expressed his own attitude: ‘the Age of Cultivation Civilization is absolutely not the olden days of imperial autocracy. A civilized system is unable to tolerate such a provocation, and even further, the modern civilized system cannot be allowed to collapse’. At the same time he stated that If he discovered Vermilion Snow’s hiding place, even if she was separated by a distance of 5,000 kilometers, he would definitely put her to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Daomaster Droughtbringer didn’t make an appearance, but he entrusted his Majordomo Senior Farcloud to pass on: the era of ancient cultivation when the strongest fist reigned supreme is already a thing of the past. If anyone dares to provoke modern-day Earth’s sphere of culture, in my capacity as one of the Myriad Demons Palace’s three forebearers, she must comply with the decisions of the greater tide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To date, there has been no word of Vermilion Snow. The Yixue Clan and the Zhou Clan have calculated the divination three times, but are unable to find her whereabouts. Mr. Tao Hongzhi, an expert on the study of Demon Society and Modern Civilization has suggested that if Vermilion Snow hid in her own private secret realm that she discovered among Earth’s numerous secret ancient cultivation realms, almost nothing could be hardly accomplished within the next several decades. However, a majority of human cultivators suspect the Myriad Demons Palace of deliberate asylum. This Spring Festival, Nantong Province’s 4,000 surviving cultivators will stage a sit-in at Shennong Forestry, Daomaster Blackmount’s Dao sanctum, drawing widespread attention. Several of the Chinese government’s high officials have appeared to temporarily settle this matter.</span></p>

Still, it will become the target of everyone’s attention. This incident in itself cannot be considered a change in peace and security of what things in the future will be like, as brought by the path between humanity and demons. We’ll have to request everyone to wait and see.</span></p>

It’s hard to say the next time will be a second Vermilion Snow! To transgress against my human race, even though I am inadequate, she must be put to death!

Is that era of small clans and powers still alive and well? Aren’t there even mortals around? There’s no reason to be worried every day that you’ll be killed off by someone with an unseen blade! You know that’s just a novel, too! Even in the ancient cultivation era, things weren’t like that! Even the State of Qin still needed to pay attention for a good reason to send out troops! Any time period has a civilized ground work! These days, a guided missile can threaten a Foundation Establishment cultivator and a nuclear warhead can pose a threat to a Core Formation cultivator. This is society’s balance of standards. You’re not taking into account that ordinary people have invented all kinds of things; things that you can’t use!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;- ID: My Name is MT.</span></p>

If you’re not going to make a web call, are you going to use a paper crane? A call takes a second! It’s not the quarter-hour of a paper crane! A quarter of an hour is enough time for a Foundation Establishment senior to kill you ten times! Moreover, unless you’re a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the cars and airplanes of ordinary people are convenient! Don’t tell me it’s like the ancient cultivation era, and I’d still be required to ask my senior to sit on his flying sword if I left the sect?

It was because their emperors, of the Li lineage, all had a weakness among all of China’s emperors, and that was to demonstrate the legitimacy of their throne by using the relationships they’d obtained with celestial immortals. This was to prove they had received the Mandate of Heaven, and their lives would be eternal and prosperous. The immortal that the Tang won over was the Old Master, Lao Er.” <span id="footnote-ref-4f11"><a href="#footnote-4f11">[1]</a></span></span></p>

In case you are unaware, the Book of Changes is considered one of THE Daoist text. I thought about using the title “The Trinity” but as you may know, this is a term used in Christianity. The three components of the unities can be considered: the Dao, cosmology, and alchemy. <a href="#footnote-ref-8e0d"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></p>
