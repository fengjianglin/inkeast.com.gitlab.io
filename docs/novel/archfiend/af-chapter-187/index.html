 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 187: Danxia Temple (6)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone understood this meaning. One after another, they began to sit down in meditation. Like so, the group of people and the prehistoric livyatan surprisingly formed a strange peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In such a manner, the first day passed. On the second day no one moved. Merely… all of them had adjusted their conditions to peak capacity! At night, the bright moon was up in the sky. Without warning, the giant tortoise puppet that everyone was meditating on started to shake all over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi calmly opened his eyes. In a place pleasing to the eye and under moonlight, the water’s surface that floated with gleaming crystalline reflections resembled a shattered mirror. The livyatan that he’d faced two days ago… stirred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the water, the creature roved impatiently and uneasily. A tremendous shadow appeared like a picture underwater. As a nearly 20-meter-long tail raised upwards, it brought a boundless lake spray and heavily slammed down again! It caused the lake surface to slightly tremble like an earthquake!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi gently sighed. At the same time, a strange aroma pervaded the entire mountain cave!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s ripened! It’s ripened!” Mao Ba’er woofed and shouted hurriedly, “The fruit can’t touch the soil! Otherwise it’ll die in case it gets in! Also, if it isn’t collected within fifteen minutes, it’ll wilt! Spud! What are we still waiting for?! Hurry up! Hurry!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up.” Xu Yangyi pinched the dog’s mouth closed, despite how the other whined and shouted rowdily. His gaze was already looking overhead. Over yonder… the originally colorless and scentless Rootless Nine Bends Aqua had completely blossomed at this moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At first, it was unseen and unreachable, but now it was like a blood-red star at the cave top, radiating an intoxicating brilliance! The moonlight reflected on it, and red rays of light passed through, causing one to be dazzled and stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hooouuu…” A gloomy roar rang out. The livyatan also felt bursts of palpitations. Its scant intelligence was telling it… that the map had already been discarded and the dagger was in sight, a plot was afoot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sound was a warning, a warning to Xu Yangyi and the rest. If they dipped a finger on the Rootless Nine Bends Aqua, then it would be a battle to the death, ceaseless until eternal rest! As the overlord in the water here, only one side could stand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one spoke. Everyone was waiting for the instant of ripening. It was a mystery as to how long it had been. Ten minutes or twenty minutes. Maybe an hour… As the moonlight was covered by a black cloud, a bloodthirsty curve drew at the corner of Xu Yangyi’s mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this shout, Mo Yeyu’s pupils suddenly contracted. Both his sleeves shook, and two brocaded pouches followed the wind and carried into the night sky. Shortly afterwards, a crash echoed. Several hundred hawk puppets assumed the shape of a staircase within the cavern! Beneath moonlight, this scene was vividly lifelike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;was their staircase leading to the cave top! At the same time, the hawks also served as a stepping board for cultivators to move in the air! In these several days, while it appeared that they were meditating, they had already used each of their advantages to plot every step!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pretty!” Quan Ningyue giggled loudly. In the next instant, her giant hammer suddenly separated and reassembled at lightning speed. In a wink, it transformed into a huge machete!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dragon Slayer Style!” Following her bellow, her petite body fiercely erupted with myriad flames! In the sky, the huge blade drew a blazing afterimage that was over a dozen meters long! Even the sharp cry of a dragon could be heard. With a tiger’s leap, her foot landed on a hawk in the air, and she chopped down towards the livyatan’s head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">SWOOSH!!!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The water’s surface completely boiled over following this move! Tens of soaring water columns exploded forth with a rumble! This momentum seemed to want to split this giant whale in two!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Five Thunders Law… Immortal Sword Request!” Yang Xueqing growled, and endless thunderbolts converged in her hand. In a twinkling, an ancient sword hilt appeared, and she took it, brandishing it along the wind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom boom boom!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Infinite lightning directly sparkled and formed the sword blade! She herself… had likewise become a thunderbolt. Woman and sword united as one, charging towards the massive whale!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A huge fiery blade slashed the giant whale’s body. Immediately, a white scar appeared. Without pause, Quan Ningyue’s hand and foot promptly split open, and countless magik treasures flew out from her body! In an instant, they actually entered the creature’s flesh inch by inch! She used herself to sink deeply into the livyatan’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tiny person and a colossal whale. A total eruption only existed in the span of these fifteen minutes! No one was left with further reservation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“ROAAR!!!” At this moment, each second was extremely precious! The livyatan roared angrily and countless blue rays of light quickly condensed within its body from all around! In the next second, a giant fish phantom appeared behind it. The entire lake surged up by several tens of meters! The whale-demon simply disregarded Quan Ningyue who was hanging on its body, a discontinuous hum coming from its immense mouth for the first time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hidden… Dragon… Goes To Sea!” The voice stammered, but it was indeed a human voice! Already, this tremendous demon was truly on the cusp of Form Transformation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">CRASH!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This second of tranquility had been exchanged with unrecognizable changes in the next moment! Giant waves screamed with destructive power that crushed things as easily as rotten wood, bursting forth from the livyatan as the nexus! It was a world of water. A giant tens-of-meters-tall wave produced a heart-shaking roar, crashing towards everyone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck!” Xu Yangyi bounded up on his feet and revolved his spiritual force with maximum power! Not only his, but each person’s face was terribly grave right now. A few of the Zhao Clan’s cultivators who hadn’t experienced arcane combat were already so frightened that they were ashen-faced!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">FWAP!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In mere moments, the terrible, giant wave had arrived in front of them! It even formed a giant shadow! Pitifully small in contrast to this giant wave, each person would be engulfed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The wave hadn’t entered the lakewaters, but very soon countless waves relentlessly advanced from behind! It was as if the entire lake was going to be emptied! These giant waves were like a 10,000-catty sledgehammer, smashing everyone to the lakebed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Good strength…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Under the water, Xu Yangyi held in his breath. He likewise even came to appreciate a demonbeast’s valiance. Hard outer skin transformed the beast into a mobile fortress. That moreover wasn’t to speak of the elysial divine ability originating from the inheritance of its millions-of-years-old bloodline. On the ground, this move was absolutely capable of causing a small tsunami! It could even compare to an initial-stage Foundation Establishment’s might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However… he just didn’t have a moment to rest. This was because his chest seemed to have been struck by a heavy mallet moments ago. Even he couldn’t withstand the feeling of a giant wave slamming down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lines of blood spilled out from the side of Xu Yangyi’s mouth. As his blood drifted on the waves, he shockingly discovered… that there were things in the water! They were a kind of extremely bizarre organism like a flea. They were the size of a palm and had six legs equipped with barbed claws. In the boundless water, these creatures swam towards them at lightning speed!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;His pupils needled, and he swiftly covered his nostrils. In disbelief, he looked at the giant whale. He clearly saw… that these insects had all come from the enemy’s entire body! Like cruisers released from an aircraft carrier, they formed an unimaginable killing formation in the water!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whale lice!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi immediately knew what these things were. On each whale’s body, these things were certain to dwell. On an ordinary whale’s body, they were only cleaners. On a whale-demon’s body, they were also cleaners! However, what they cleansed was his life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thump! Thump!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The massive torrenting wave slammed everyone into the water. At his side was a Zhao Clan disciple, but the disciple had already become shaped like a ball! The countless whale lice had mobbed the cultivator’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the water, there was no miserable wail. All Xu Yangyi could see was the other’s still-spasming hand… and the endless blood that floated upwards! In the present waters, over a dozen figures were crawling with whale lice all over. All of them bloodily sunk to the lake’s deepest depth. Looking below the quiet green waters was wretchedly horrid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ten Cardinals Red Lotus!” He sucked in deeply. There were around a hundred thousand whale lice on a blue whale’s body. At the very least… there were several hundred thousand whale lice on the livyatan’s body! Enough to gnaw everyone down so that not even their bones remained!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In the water, a blazing conflagration exploded and scattered! By these raging flames, the surrounding whale lice all transformed into flying ash! Peering down from above, a burning inferno suddenly appeared underwater and formed an immense maelstrom of interweaving water and fire. It was incredibly strange!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, tens of thunderbolts sparked. In the entire lake, these two places were the most distinct. Nevertheless, Xu Yangyi quickly felt something was wrong! This was because… the water beside him had changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a kind of distinct sensation, akin to the water being stirred by a giant hand. The water flow was changing, so… his own figure was simply unable to keep steady in the water! In the wake of this immense force, almost incapable of being resisted, his figure wavered. He realized what was happening at once!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Son of a bitch…” Xu Yangyi fiercely gritted his teeth. The underwater movement was too obvious. Regarding a demonbeast, whose majority of actions presently stemmed from instinct, he was certain to be attacked. Similarly, because of the instinctual bloodline fear that demons held towards lightning and the deterrence of the lightning in the water, the livyatan had actually taken him as a soft persimmon, an easy target!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below the murky water, he already saw a tremendous shadow cutting a graceful and heart-shaking arc. With extreme speed, the beast rushed straight at him! Even now, the change in water flow caused his veins to nearly leave his body. He made out… the livyatan’s tail! A tail no less than over a dozen meters wide!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shadowlumen Armor!” There was no hesitation whatsoever. Such a tremendous bulk, the sweeping power of this tail… Even he would end up with a massive whole-body fracture to say the least!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Punishment!” In a flash, black armor enwrapped his body, and he formed seals with both hands. The people floating on the water’s surface were all instantly dazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under moonlight, there were countless shadows in the sky. In the air, they converged to form weapons surging with black spiritual force. As for the the target of these weapons, all of them were aimed towards the livyatan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“ROOOAAR…” a thunderous howl rang out. This time, it carried a sliver of instinctual fear! For the first time, the beast had revealed its own fright! These weapons… were dangerous, very dangerous! While its meager intelligence reminded it that these weapons in themselves couldn’t be considered quite strong, why was it so scared?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s the Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Punishment!” Fang Cheng popped his head out from the water and watched the thousands of weapons in the sky, flabbergasted. “He’s borrowing Master-Ancestor’s armor from back then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish swish swish!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rain fell with a pitter-patter! With the sound of light wind, all the weapons frantically stabbed at the giant tail, not waiting for the livyatan to react!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rather strange. The shadow weapons didn’t make so much as noise as they entered the water, seemingly transforming into ink as they went in. Yet in the next second, a lung-splitting roar followed! After the horde of weapons silently dove into the water, a giant black tail swung up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood, akin to cinnabar in ink, dyed the water red in short time. But soon, a black figure shot out of the water like a struck marble! In the air, it still even bore a trace of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Xu Yangyi’s flying body was stopped, and he turned his head to look back. Fang Cheng was looking at him in worry. “Nothing wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m good…” Xu Yangyi said and a mouthful of blood rushed out of his mouth like a fountain. The Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Punishment wasn’t a divine ability that could be prompted and used. It had a rough formation time of several seconds. In a Core Formation ancestor’s hand, this time could possibly be completed under the concealment of other divine abilities, but in such a critical moment, these few seconds had been swapped with him being directly slapped away by the livyatan! Like a bullet fired from a gun, he had been swatted from the water into a straight line!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t speak!” Fang Cheng was startled. Xu Yangyi sensed his own body. His left shoulder was almost completely crushed. If it weren’t for Fang Cheng catching him, the consequences would be too terrible to imagine if he slammed right into the rock wall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve underestimated this guy a little…” Xu Yangyi took a few deep breaths. His internal organs ached with a scorching heat. He was still fine, however. Right now, only his left shoulder had lost battle strength. It wasn’t a mortal wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And this was even after donning a Core Formation ancestor’s armor. If he hadn’t made the fast decision to wear it and if the Ten Thousand Shadows Heavenly Punishment had come a few seconds later… Thinking back to that nearly irresistible impact force in the water, he clearly understood that the aftermath was practically unimaginable!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“ROAARR!!!” a wail, shouting itself hoarse, suddenly came from under the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth. “I broke an arm, but it can’t be feeling any better!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lake surface surged again with raging and swelling waves! Yet this time, it wasn’t a divine ability. That was because the small tsunami this time was mingled with the livyatan’s continuous screams and snarls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its eyes had already flushed red in pain. It absolutely hadn’t expected this. It held a fear of lightning, so it instinctively chose the fire sea and used its tail to whip forwards. Unexpectedly, it had whipped an iron plate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other hadn’t died… The beast could feel it! It, however, had broken its tail! In the lake, the enormous body spun about incessantly. Waves followed in the wake of its body that frenzied in pain, pervading the air all around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi looked at his watch again. Ten minutes had passed! These were the last five minutes! If the flower wasn’t plucked in five minutes, this opportunity would scatter into ash and smoke!</span></p>
