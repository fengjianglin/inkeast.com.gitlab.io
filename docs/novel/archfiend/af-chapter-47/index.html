He had finally found a flower petal belonging to him. Among the endless flowers that passed, not a single one had touched him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since that day his ten-odd years of training concluded, he had never cared for status and wealth. Finally, his footsteps had stopped before a not-too-appealing autumn chrysanthemum.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is the Featherwood Guard’s promise something that Fellow Daoist Hibiscus can undertake?” As everyone boiled over, a man’s serene voice emerged from behind the qi walls. It was only a strand of spiritual force, so one found it difficult to perceive. To hear it clearly cost a bit strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as this voice arose, everyone’s mouths froze. Not only was it the clans, even a few great Foundation Establishment cultivators were the same. This was Xu Yangyi’s voice! Presently, his spiritual force had been scattered apart by that strange bullet. This was the spiritual force he had barely managed to store.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Hibiscus had bellowed, her heart had long since hit rock-bottom. The Featherwood Guard was a special organization. To be frank, it was a tremendous guild. Any cultivator’s time was comparable to gold, and while a hundred years seemed very long, it was in fact not as endless as in the imaginations of cultivation-crazy cultivators. But what if he needed some item, yet it wasn’t in someone else’s hands? Or perhaps he didn’t have the item to be exchanged and only had spirit stones. What would he do?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, he could go the Featherwood Guard to post a mission, and the Featherwood Guard would take a fifth of the commission from the issued mission. In comparison to the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion that dominated most supplementary ventures, and the government agency CSIB that held an intimate relationship with the Chinese government, they were the poorest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She could do nothing more than shout, but it was beyond her expectations that Xu Yangyi would respond! Their conditions couldn’t be considered generous in the slightest, yet she hadn’t expected to hear the sound of a heavenly lyre, in the next second!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“T-This…” The clan master of a great clan was flabbergasted. He didn’t dare believe everything he had just heard. “Did I hear that right?” He asked and looked at his assistant by his side in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No…” The assistant pursed his lips. He felt it unimaginable as well. What was happening? The Featherwood Guard was a major power, but their conditions couldn’t be considered the best in any respect! Instead of asking Moonchaser, the CSIB, or the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion, why had Xu Yangyi instead questioned the Featherwood Guard?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is this guy crazy, or is there something wrong with his mind?!” A clan master obtained a definite answer, and suddenly slapped the stone beneath him, nearly spitting out a mouthful of blood in rage. “Are our Lu Clan’s stated conditions worse than the Featherwood Guard’s?! Their organization is limited to their structured methods. Coming out with those kinds of conditions is already their limit! Not to even speak for ourselves, but which of the items put forward just now by either the alchemy-specialized Chen Clan or the talisman-specialized Wang Clan are lacking in comparison with the Featherwood Guard?! Is he mentally ill?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In a time like this where everyone wants a piece of him, he didn’t pick the best conditions, but the mediocre Featherwood Guard?!” His eyes flaring with anger, an old man with a full head of white hair rapped the cane in his hand on the ground with a thud.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they lost out to the CSIB’s and Bountiful Treasure Pavilion’s extravagant conditions, they could only sigh deeply that their target couldn’t be had. However, the Featherwood Guard was far from comparable to these two organizations. Their conditions weren’t much different from a great clan’s, yet Xu Yangyi had called out to them first. How the hell did that happen?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The seeds appointed to his selection within the Featherwood Guard will be extremely generous! But what about the signing bonus?! The favor of resources?! His future pledge?!” A middle-aged woman direly fanned herself and said hotly, “They don’t hold an advantage in a single aspect! Not a single one!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He actually answered the Featherwood Guard?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hibiscus was dazed for but a second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She nearly used all of her spiritual force in the next second and yelled, “I can guarantee it! I guarantee I can do it! The Featherwood Guard’s Deputy Hallmaster Tang is rushing here! He’s a middle-stage Foundation Establishment Senior! Deputy Hallmaster Tang can also promise to immediately handle your sign-on bonus at the same time! The Featherwood Guard doesn’t have many precious treasures, but our number of readily available spirit stones is by no means few! The Featherwood Guard will reimburse all the spirit stones and resources that Fellow Daoist Xu will need later on, even a high-grade Spirit Focusing Formation! Among the few grand artificers that exist, one of them is in the Featherwood Guard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Xu!’ Her voice had been stirred to hoarseness, and she excitedly took a step forward. “As long as you join our organization, all conditions may be discussed!” She hadn’t anticipated whatsoever that the first time Xu Yangyi would raise his voice it would actually be directed to the Featherwood Guard!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brilliant fireworks suddenly exploded all around her, and she took out the next condition with barely any consideration! This was the Featherwood Guard’s bottom line!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surroundings were quiet as the Featherwood Guard declared their conditions. The other clans could denounce it, but when this major player in the cultivation world spoke there was no room for interruption. Everyone’s gazes were nailed to the billowing qi walls, waiting on Xu Yangyi’s response, on the edge of their seats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi mumbled to himself. In his silence, Vulture nearly smashed his cell phone!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Fenyi City’s Heavens Law branch be so poor?! Why couldn’t they change their communication equipment?! At such an important juncture, when he’d been planning to ask if Xu Yangyi had other hobbies or interests, he actually couldn’t make a call?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t wait any longer… He sucked in deeply and said clearly, “Fellow Daoist Xu! Are you not planning on considering? The Bountiful Treasures Pavilion isn’t wanting in any way. Be it rare treasures, precious items, or spirit stones, we have it all! Whatever the Featherwood Guard can give to you, our Bountiful Treasures Pavilion can bestow as well! Moreover, we’ll give double!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While it was a major power, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion’s lack of a Core Formation cultivator had forever been it’s pain! On both accounts of a genius second only to Sunnihilator and a Core Formation-grade arcane effort, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion had neither! With these two points added together, there was a sliver of a possibility “equal” to a Core Formation master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Give up? He wasn’t resigned to do so at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no time to ask the branch again… Now was the time put forth a heavy fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you promise…” He gritted his teeth and opened his wrist watch. “I’ll immediately open dispatch to the branch. You can discuss it here with the branch chief! No matter any condition you want!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Xu… do you know why Heavens Law is unable to find the murderer you want to find?” Within the qi walls, there was no answer, so Vulture cut straight to the heart of the matter and asked lowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was silent again. After the passage of a few seconds, Xu Yangyi’s voice finally echoed out, “I’d like to hear the details.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hook, line, and sinker!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture’s eyes twinkled. This was it… The crux of the matter laid here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While perhaps the cultivations of the special envoys from the Big Three weren’t the highest, they were undeniably the ones who knew the most about the world’s ways! In the instant he heard that the Featherwood Guard, who didn’t hold a superior position in a single aspect, was able to obtain Xu Yangyi’s favor, he realized it was only because they had added on one more condition!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To assist Xu Yangyi in finding the murderer of his parents!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s because of the scope of authority!” He immediately said without a moment’s hesitation, “Fellow Daoist Xu, you couldn’t possibly be aware unless you were one of Heavens Law’s half-step Core Formation cultivators or true Core Formation authorities… but on China’s wanted list, besides the A-rank listing… there’s also the S-rank listing above!

  <p>2. 一目五 - Mr. Yimu Wu. This is a pretty interesting Chinese folk monster. It is actually a group of ghost considered one entity. There are five ghosts and only one of them has an eye. They other four are blind. The blind ghosts depend on the ghost with the eye to find food. It is said his arrival brings plague, which has do with how he selects his victims. He comes at night while people are sleeping and smells their breath. From what I read, each successive victim’s breath he smells will fall sicker and sicker until the last one dies, and then everyone is done for. <a href="#footnote-ref-b75e"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
