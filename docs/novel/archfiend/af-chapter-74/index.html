However, Zhou Tingting didn’t have a frightened expression at all. She only looked at Xu Yangyi with a shining gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After leaving Bai County, I gave you one final chance.” Xu Yangyi gently puffed out smoke, watching the vapor drift away in the wind. He said indifferently, “Now, you can chose on your own to leave right away. But at that time, you’ll have to let me leave an imprint in your spiritual senses. The same as Li Zongyuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, you can choose to walk together with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right now…” He inhaled deeply and stamped out his cigarette butt, looking coldly at the duo. “you know where I’m staying, and you know that I’m being hunted. You’re aware of the opposition’s background. There no longer exists even a shred of retreat for you. Follow me or die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m willing to follow you, sir!” Before his voice fell, Zhou Tingting immediately bowed. “Since I saw you the first time, I knew I could only follow you, and only you were able to guide me! In the past several days, I’ve truly seen how fierce you are, sir! I have faith in my choice!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi smiled and leaned his head. Zhou Tingting pursed her lips as she walked over to the side. He didn’t speak, only calmly looking at the wolf-demon. “I still don’t know your name.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“C-Cheng Jianfeng…” The wolf-demon simply dared not look straight at the other, lowering his head. After a while he said, “W-Why are you telling us this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only to let you know that I’m not actually a person that enjoys killing.” Xu Yangyi said a tad bit ruefully and sighed, “Sometimes, some people choose the worst place at the worst time to appear in front of someone that they should show up to the least. That’s why the person has a reason to kill.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you don’t choose, I’m sorry. If you have some final testament, you can tell me now. I’ll deliver you to eternal rest without suffering. I’ll also agree to help you complete your desires.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wolf-demon’s lips shivered. He was still young. He hadn’t left the city, and he simply didn’t think of what a true cultivator was like. Now, in this year of 2019, he would remember this day for the rest of his life. He had broadened his horizons on a true cultivator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merciless, yet sentimental. Only oneself as god, with no clear belief and respect to the deities. Forever, they held the greatest confidence in themselves. Any and all affairs that influenced their cultivation, so long as they didn’t violate their principles, would be cleanly handled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quite understood the kind of situation he was in right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Friendship? No, he had only seen one side, nothing more than a one-time cooperation. However, he knew of the other’s secret and the identities of the people hunting him down! Xu Yangyi had 101 reasons to kill him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If his cultivation was swapped with Xu Yangyi’s, then perhaps he would’ve already made a move while inside the toad’s stomach.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… am willing to swear allegiance…” Cheng Jianfeng gritted his teeth, white mist continuously exuding from his seven apertures. In a flash, an elaborate little wolf appeared before Xu Yangyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi silently bit his finger and a drop of blood fell into the surface of the little wolf. Cheng Jianfeng shivered all over, and a kind of indescribable sensation suddenly emerged within his spiritual sense. It seemed… like there were two thoughts in his spiritual sense. He could vaguely feel Xu Yangyi, and Xu Yangyi also existed within his spiritual sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi closed his eyes. All was prepared, and he only had to wait several days to begin cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four days later, within the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the basement of a two-story cottage near a fish pond, Xu Yangyi looked at a lump of silver dust in his palm, muttering to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Placing the dust under his nose and sniffing it, a fresh aroma battered his senses. It was like a fragrance after a rainy spring day in a bamboo forest that could cause someone to stop in intoxication. However, this scent was even more simple and elegant, still ancient.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Using his forefinger to touch it, he placed it in his mouth for a taste. It entered his mouth and then transformed, raindrops seemingly coming together as water. Yet in his mouth, it left behind a flavor even more refreshing than any chewing gum. It was as if all his taste buds had opened in a flash.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The basement didn’t allow for wind to pass through. In barely three days, Li Zongyuan had bought it. This house had been used for a pickled-vegetable business. Because of Li Zongyuan, they had a sizeable basement as a result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The space was 700 square feet in size and four meters high. Originally, it should’ve been a dusky space permeated with a strange odor, but now, a kind of fresh fragrance, that of a spring valley, pervaded the air. The ground was no longer the cheap slate of a peasant family, but rather installed with a layer of true wood flooring. On top, a layer of soft scarlet carpet was spread out. At first, the overhead was lit by fluorescent light, but had been exchanged earlier with four or five crystal chandeliers. A few calligraphy pieces and paintings of unknown origin hung on the wall, appearing refined and tasteful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Zongyuan nervously stood at the side. He had done all the decorating here and expended much thought into it. However, he further understood that it was the Dew Congealing Grass that allowed his survival. If these things couldn’t please the fiend in front of him, then when the time came…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was the possibility that in a long time from now, someone would discover a tremendous toad corpse around twenty to thirty meters in size, in this basement...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“High grade.” Xu Yangyi took a box containing the powder and placed it at the side in satisfaction, nodding. “Dew Congealing Grass sprouts at midnight. As the first rays of the sun rise, the qi vanishes. In case it comes across a human body, it will immediately wither. It can only be grown in an extremely acidic place…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi glanced at Li Zongyuan. “I won’t ask about your secret art. However, how did you establish this dimensional space within your stomach?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master is resplendently brilliant.” Li Zongyuan’s heart pounded and he swallowed his saliva, laughing wryly, “I’ve been picking this Dew Congealing Grass that I’ve cultivated for more than a decade. Canaries must be used to pick them, and then they are placed in a cold ice container… This is a delicate work…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The implication from the toad to the human was clear. You want to cultivate? Only I can do these things. I’m still quite useful! Don’t kill me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi smiled. From the beginning, he never had the thought of killing the other. Compared with the Eternal Alchemy Canon, the life of the insignificant Li Zongyuan was not even worth a scrap of value.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ve proven your worth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when these words were said that Li Zongyuan felt his whole body relax. He nearly sat down on the ground, paralyzed. Throughout the whole journey, only his heart was truly hanging! He had always strove with his best efforts to strike up relations. Only now did he feel his life had returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Next… was to see if the pact could be removed. Although the hope for it was quite uncertain, was the time still not long?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And the others?” Xu Yangyi asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’ve contacted a school…” Li Zongyuan watched Xu Yangyi’s expression and replied, “Mr. Xu, they’re still at the age of a junior in high school… without a great teacher to guide cultivation, and since you’re also going to enter seclusion now, their best choice is but to rely on a cultivation university to seek advancement and wait for you to come out seclusion.”</span></p>

He hadn’t paid it any mind, but now that he was reading it, drawing a connection to the Dew Congealing Grass, a cold sweat exuded from his entire body in fright!&nbsp;</span></p>

The drug was somewhat poisonous, and although cultivation seemed quick, excessive pill elixir usage would lead the medicinality in the pill elixir to choke up the meridians. Ultimately, the heavy accumulations were difficult to pull back from, and one’s cultivation stopped at some boundary.</span></p>

Before, his heart was filled with grievance and thoughts of escape, yet in a flash, they dissipated like smoke. For the first time, he called out ‘master’ with honest sincerity, his voice shaky. “Y-You’re an alchemist?”&nbsp;</span></p>

Clenching his teeth, he said. “Alchemists are required to go to the Alchemy Association’s ‘Pill Cauldron Corporation’ subsidiary to enroll. Did you go? Also, I’ve heard that aptitude is still going to be tested. Master… y-your neurons have opened?”</span></p>

What was this? This was the thought of trying out whether or not one could refine pills from seeing the majestic status of an alchemist! Every year, if there weren’t ten thousand such cultivators, there was sure to be eight thousand! These colonies of penguins were everywhere! There couldn’t be too many of these kinds of dimwitted ninnies!&nbsp;</span></p>
