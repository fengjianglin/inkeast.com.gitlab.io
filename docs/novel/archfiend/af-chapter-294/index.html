The fall of Mo Yeyu’s wall was like a crab stripped of its shell, exposing the soft tender flesh within!</span></p>

The Spirit Accumulation Cannons in the hands of Xu Yangyi’s forces were already shaking so much that they couldn’t be held. In a war of mortals, the charge of a thousand-strong cavalry could break the minds of infantry. It was the kind of suffocating feeling and dread that brought the earth to quake and tides to churn, enough to to make any cultivator on the battlefield for the first time to flee on mere contact. Although there were only a hundred riders… their weaponry, momentum, and battle formation far transcended mortals’ by a hundred fold!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“KILL!!!” The armored rider of pure white hefted up his longspear from his waist at an angle! His left hand waved a two-meter-long banner with a white tiger drawn on it. The flag fluttered in the wind, like a sailing reaper in the glow of the moon, causing both heart and soul to tremble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“KILL!!!” Following his mad howl, the hundred riders behind him shook the heavens together with their cry for murder, jolting the four reaches!</span></p>

Their objective was the bottom of the crescent! To drill through it! Tear it apart! Encircle and kill! In several rounds, everyone here would be exterminated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior Brother!” “Brother Xu!” Chu Zhaonan and Fang Cheng shouted in unison.

The faces of the black tigers and riders were almost clear enough to be discerned, like black reapers under moonlight. All of a sudden, a cultivator in formation, his lips quivering and sweat pouring like rain, madly cried out and threw down his cannon, turning back and making a run for it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The barrier protecting him had shattered… he had to run! This was too awful! Such a battle formation! The reaper’s sickle was already poised at his neck! In his heart, oppressive terror almost drove him insane!</span></p>

Reflected upon the eyes of over a dozen cultivators who were preparing to flee, it was incomparably striking!</span></p>

Towards a cultivator who he normally considered important and had now been the first to flee, he didn’t have one shred of tolerance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“On a narrow path with rivals and enemies alike, the brave find victory!!!

To retreat was to die… to die in absolute despair. To not retreat… was to still die, yet the opponent wouldn’t feel despair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tiger Screams In The Mountain Forest!” The leading rider roared to the heavens, like he was breathing out the hot blood of his thoughts. The longspear in his hand fired a scarlet-red edge and traveled twenty meters to directly take the Xingtian Legion’s battle formation, who were already gritting their teeth to brace themselves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Following his spear thrust, the red beams of a hundred riders behind him erupted at the same time! This place… had become an asura ground of interweaving red light! The ground was torn asunder by countless cracks! And yet… they still didn’t slow down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Skewer the Xingtian Legion!</span></p>

In the next second, the protective artifacts of the first line of cultivators all raised up! A brilliant wall of prismatic light took shape in front of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stand firm in formation!” The old man roared as his voice broke. His eyes had become completely scarlet, and his heart was an icy expanse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he dared come, he wasn’t ill-prepared whatsoever. On the contrary, his preparations were rather sufficient. However, he didn’t understand why one of his disciples—ordinarily more arrogant than any other—was now dumbstruck like a wooden chicken. The disciple’s first reaction wasn’t to stay in the formation he had long practiced, but rather take out a defensive treasure. What would be the aftermath of each protective treasure against the impact force of several thousand meters and late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators fully armed with supreme artifacts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first echelon… will break…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Now, this thought arose in his mind, yet both his hands were shaking. He couldn’t shout for them to come down and moreover yell for reinforcements!</span></p>

Many people trembled, their hands immediately forming seals. Nonetheless, the earth’s trembling progressively intensified. The first echelon of cultivators continued to stagger a few times! As a shadow rushed like arcing electricity before a cultivator, the cultivator raised his head in despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last image in his eyes was snow-white armor, pure white like the soul. It seemed as pure and holy as a snow lotus. In the next instant, countless snowflakes gushed out of this snow-white armor, dyeing the armor a monstrous blood-red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body was torn apart by an explosion, a splatter of blood in an instant.</span></p>

Red and all kinds of colors exploded in the air, forming a horrific vortex of qi! It was so fast that there was no more time to form seals! As a ringing noise echoed, the first defensive line of camouflaged cultivators fell entirely apart! All their protective artifacts crumbled away! Blood-red spiritual light devastated them as if it wanted to tear the first echelon into smithereens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Puh!” “ARGH!!!” Blood-curdling screams rose and fell! There was no exception among the first line, a total of twenty-somewhat cultivators. They all spat out mouthfuls of blood and flew into the air, decapitated and torn to pieces. The magik artifacts that they had placed all their hopes in had shattered apart with a rumble. The pupils of the second echelon of cultivators suddenly dilated because they saw… a terrible scene that would live with them forever!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden chains in between the riders now followed the raging charge, like sickles harvesting wheat! Even if they dodged the central forces of Screaming Wind Legion, they would be immediately split in two as long as they touched the chain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Puh!” A cultivator screeched, both of his hands placed in front of him in defense. Less than half a second later, two black whirlwinds stormed past his body! To his shock… he soon opened his eyes and saw the lower half of his not-too-distant body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lower half of his body astonishingly hung on the chain, being dragged away!</span></p>

In an instant, the third camouflaged rampart disappeared! But the final line was ten meters away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Screaming Wind Legion!” First blood had been drawn! A spear ripped apart a cultivator in front, ruining the cultivator’s body! Blood sprayed over the leading rider’s snow-white armor, yet the he wasn’t put off in the slightest. Instead, he raised his hand and waved, his white tiger banner suddenly pulled out behind him! Following his high-speed impact, the flag flew up in the air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Onwards to victory!!!” Soon after he said these words, an overwhelming howl followed! The eyes of all the riders revealed mad zealotry, the black flood emotionlessly reaping lives. An untold number of cultivators had been hit squarely and torn in two!

There were no set defensive formations around him! The first cultivator fled in terror and then… there was a second… a third!</span></p>

The enemy… hadn’t even lost a hair. From all around, the black flood surrounded and destroyed them, like an awl plunged into the bottom. The blood of his own kin was on his hand. He had already killed five of his own clan’s disciples, but he now didn’t wish to kill.</span></p>

A war of cultivators and a one-versus-one fight were two different concepts! In similar raids, he no longer knew how many clans he had broken. Among the clans the Screaming Wind Legion had exterminated, not a single one had believed that they wouldn’t be able to resist. However, it was merely a belief.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <div id="footnote-3536">
  <p>1. This is a poem by a major Tang poet named Wang Changling (698-756 CE). The gist of the entire poem depicts the scene of a border fortress, and an anti-war sentiment. <a href="#footnote-ref-3536"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-eb8f">
  <p>2. Zhao Yun. Died 229 CE. This is a reference to the great hero of the Three Kingdoms era. The story goes as follows. Zhao Yun was loyal to the warlord Liu Bei. Liu Bei had a son named Liu Shan, who got captured. So Zhao Yun slaughtered his way in and out of a “million-strong army” to rescue Liu Shan, and killed many enemy soldiers. <a href="#footnote-ref-eb8f"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
 </div> 
 <div id="footnote-f405">
  <p>3. Another reference from the Three Kingdoms era. Zhang Fei was known for his strength and brutality. During the Battle of Changban, he stood alone at Dangyang Bridge against Cao Cao’s forces to trick them into not attacking (because they thought Zhang Fei’s forces would ambush them. In truth, Zhang Fei only had twenty riders with him). <a href="#footnote-ref-f405"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
