 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi was unaware of everything that had occurred back in the office. Nonetheless, even if he knew, he still wouldn’t care the least bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The present him was strolling towards Sanshui City’s Security Department, where Bureau Chief Zheng’s office was located.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he pushed open the door to the chief’s office, the air conditioning that blew on his body was a great immediate relief. Across from him, there was a middle-aged man speaking seriously with his secretary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man wasn’t tall, at most around 1.73 meters. His hair was sparse and his face was square. His face was filled with great changes due to how long he’d held his high station, carrying a prestige that wasn’t angry but still held power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing the door hadn’t been knocked on but rather pushed open, Chief Zheng’s gaze lightly swept over, yet he didn’t say a word. Instead, he gently opened a folding fan in his hand and rocked it neither slowly nor swiftly. “A country has laws and a family has rules. Without regulations, there are no boundaries. The ancestors spoke well...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s…” The assistant listened to these words that seemed to hold a second meaning. Immediately, his mental aptitude automatically filled in the blanks, and he glanced at Xu Yangyi. Without a sudden move or indication, the secretary smiled at Chief Zheng and said, “However, the military police have transferred someone in now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everything has a system and regulations.” Chief Zheng gently held his teacup and blew on it. “He wanted to be transferred in. It’s not like I didn’t try to reason with him. But to come directly to me, the question is… Is it to find Lieutenant Colonel Li or is it to find me, Chief Zheng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good tea.” He pursed his lips in satisfaction. “Despite urgent business, systems, and codes… can anyone just overstep authority to transfer someone over and make the bureau chief act instead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For an emergency, sure. We go through procedures, so that everyone is fine. The time it takes is a bit long but no careless mistakes come up.” Chief Zheng shut his folding fan with a snap, and his gaze calmly fell on Xu Yangyi, who was standing besides a bookcase. He said to his secretary in an authoritative manner, “You leave first. Tell him that whatever the matter may be, everything has rules and regulations. Aren’t the people from the Public Security Bureau nervous? Our men aren’t enough on their own to investigate the major murder case that was just sent over. Go, alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The secretary left, and Chief Zheng coughed, seeing that Xu Yangyi hadn’t responded. Standing up, he wrung the door handle a few times, and his expression immediately changed into a smile. The folding fan in his palm softly flapped twice, and he grinned as he walked over. “Young Xu… come, come. Sit, what would you like to drink? This old man hasn’t embarrassed you, right? Work is still going smoothly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His smile was like the blooming of a Persian Chrysanthemum, completely different from moments ago. It was without the might of a superior looking upon a subordinate but rather like he’d seen an old friend. A smile of matchless sincerity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“None. It’s going without a hitch.” Xu Yangyi took out a cigarette. “May I?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course… Really, Young Xu, how many times have I said it? My office is your office. You don’t have to be so polite with me, Uncle Zheng. Come, come, sit. Let’s sit down and chat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a conversation like this, there were only two possibilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One: Xu Yangyi was Chief Zheng’s long-separated younger brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two: Xu Yangyi truly was a gilded paratrooper sent down. His background was so great that Chief Zheng couldn’t afford to offend him, didn’t risk committing an offense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Xu, you see…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Xu Yangyi had sat down, Chief Zheng hesitated to speak several times and smiled. But just as he opened his mouth, Xu Yangyi, who was sitting across from him and looking at the faint flickering of his cigarette butt, said calmly, “Duck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“???” Chief Zheng found Xu Yangyi’s words somewhat baffling, but in the next second the window behind him shattered explosively!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crash!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Like a gigantic fist had made its way in from the outside, not only did the window break apart, but even the aluminum frame had completely flown away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sliver of sparkling, translucent glass came flying past the side of Chief Zheng’s ear. Time seemed to freeze as he saw the side window that seemed to rain like flowers from the corner of his eye. Every shard reflected the side of his terrified face. Already, the blue window curtains had blown open in the wind, yet his mind hadn’t fully responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;In his fright, he became slow, like he was in a world of silence. His body was flung back with great force, knocking into the bookcase despite his best efforts. Xu Yangyi had kicked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if time had taken flow once more, the crash of countless bullet-like glass shards riddled the entire room! The body of the mangled window frame laid at the center! Chief Zheng trembled from head to toe, wanting to stand up, yet he found his feet was without the slightest strength. Even his hands supported on the table were trembling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What… What happened…?” Against his will, his voice shuddered fiercely. If he’d been standing by the window a moment ago, he would’ve been ushered away to the hospital by now! He quickly reacted, however!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Impossible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a bulletproof window! It couldn’t be seen from outside, but the window was actually a centimeter thick! What kind of bullet could shatter the entire window? A sniper bullet would only be able to cause a spider’s web of an impact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was evident that something had punched in from the outside, though! Yet this was even more of an impossibility! This was the twentieth floor! City Hall was the tallest building in the entire city! You could overlook all of Sanshui from here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His forehead slick with sweat, Chief Zheng could hear the echo of his beating heart at the side of his ear. He wanted to fidget, but he discovered his body had become terribly soft. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Y-Young Xu…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hush…” It was unknown when, but Xu Yangyi had already stood up. His expression was abnormally solemn, and he raised his finger. “There’s something here…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words were like a switch. Chief Zheng’s Adam’s apple jumped in his throat; he dared not speak anymore. In his field of vision, he looked around in fright to suddenly discover…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The window curtains!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The window curtains should’ve been hanging down at the sides of the window, yet they were now eerily suspended in midair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the top and bottom of the window... they were floating. Such a feeling seemed as if an invisible man had charged into the window and shattered the bulletproof glass and aluminum window frame! Afterwards, the window curtains just happened to cover his body without falling over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the curtain, a shape had appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light of day was still out, yet such a strange matter had occurred. Chief Zheng rigidly clenched his teeth to prevent himself from voicing his alarm. His cold sweat dripped desperately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a moment ago… there was something he couldn’t see. From an extremely distant place, it had crashed into his office with maximum speed, shredding through City Hall’s defensive measures. Until now, there had never been such a grand entry before his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thing… could shatter bulletproof glass… As for the strength of its impact… He didn’t dare imagine what the result would’ve been if Xu Yangyi hadn’t just pushed him away! Afterwards… Chief Zheng’s heart soon began to palpitate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t any changes to Xu Yangyi’s expression, yet the direction that his eyes followed had changed. Since the beginning,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;had pressed up closely against the wall, looking at the floor. But now…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;slowly lifted&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">neck, going from the side of the window and then arriving at the carpet, and then again…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of Chief Zheng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clack… Clack…” Chief Zheng’s teeth chattered softly. With&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;fixed onto him like this,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;gaze was incorporeal yet tangible. A little while ago, his connection with&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;seemed to tell him:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something’s come in. It’s entirely capable of using its mind to make out its environment</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was something… right in front of him, staring at him unblinkingly. Behind the intruder… Xu Yangyi was storing his power and waiting to strike, unknown and greatly terrifying. Just as Chief Zheng’s hand was about to slowly press the bell on the table, Xu Yangyi whispered extremely quietly at the side of his ear again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like he was a robot, Chief Zheng accepted this command. He wouldn’t dare move even once, but his entire body kept on trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Slowly, slowly lie down…” Xu Yangyi murmured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng’s heart was already filled with terror. He hadn’t seen&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, but Xu Yangyi, who was in front of him, had his hand pressed against his own left eye. The other eye was a furious blood-red, yet the pupil was white!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within Xu Yangyi’s eye, there was another image!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The color of nightfall filled Xu Yangyi’s eye with a jet-black expanse. In front of him… was a tremendous serpent that was a meter thick in diameter. Its body was outside the window, but its head had already neared Chief Zheng’s face! The distance between the two was less than 50 centimeters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its jet-black scales glittered in the setting sun’s twilight. It had a bloody maw wide enough to swallow a grown man whole that dripped light-yellow-colored saliva.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the window, on a distant building, there was a toad idly basking in the sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The toad wasn’t strange, but… it was no less than a dozen meters tall and over 30 meters long in its enormous stature! If said that the toad was a whale, then maybe someone would believe it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The creature was lazing about like so, lying deathly still atop the building. There was a three-meter-long horn on the top of its head and it had long feelers hanging down its face, like it was an illusory stone statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath the center of Sanshui City’s stadium, there was a multicolored centipede, curling its body and resting on the lawn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A centipede wasn’t odd either, but it was also over twenty meters long! A centipede that was over half a meter tall! Such that each and every section of it was armored on both sides with a golden ornamental pattern that was similar to a pair of human eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, at the far reaches of the river bank, there was a tremendous salamander. Under the water, its enormous silhouette neared no less than twenty-five meters in length. On the surface of the water, it cast a black shadow. Yet within that shadow, there was a freighter that just happened to be sailing by at top speed. It appeared to be completely unaware that there was some sort of monstrosity lying beneath the water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was by the red of Xu Yangyi’s eye that all which stopped beyond the line of human sight was revealed. Every scene was reflected upon his retina. As if it existed in another dimension, there was simply no one capable of breaking through this barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A city of demons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red in color and isolated from men, as if it was an ephemeral scene that could cause fear upon contact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sizzle…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At this time, Chief Zheng fearfully looked… at the carpet in front of him, which beyond all sense or reason, had a hole corroded through it. His pupils began to shrink back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;had come...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those things had come…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It truly was them!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;were right in front of him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more he was left to only look at Xu Yangyi, the more frightened he became! He didn’t know what was in front of him! It was as if someone had opened an elevator in the middle of the night, and the person inside said, “Sorry, it’s too crowded!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A nameless terror frantically spread through his chest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this moment, Xu Yangyi moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng didn’t see how Xu Yangyi moved. He seemed only to have seen an afterimage. In the next second, a loud crash rang out! A kind of noise like a fist striking armor suddenly echoed throughout the room! Moreover, the sound was almost within his reach!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hissssss…” Extremely gentle, a strange roar resonated in the room. Followingly, the unnaturally floating window curtains finally fell down! The room became deathly silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi retracted his fist. In that fleeting moment, he’d felt as if he had struck armor. He hadn’t exerted all of his strength. His strike was nothing more than a warning, but the serpent’s hardness exceeded his imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it… Is it gone?” Chief Zheng finally shivered with all of his might. Moments ago, fear had pressed down upon his heart. Now, he could finally vent his feelings like a surging oil well. There was no need for words but rather actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s gone.” Xu Yangyi sat down in Chief Zheng’s seat. His eyes were already back to normal. Chief Zheng trembled as he supported himself on the table top. His fingers trembling chaotically on the table, he silently and slowly stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sliding on his foot, he propped himself on the table in a panic. He didn’t dare stand too far away, staying at Xu Yangyi’s side. Presently, Xu Yangyi was sitting in his chair, but he simply didn’t care to take a seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi popped the collar of his shirt, and Chief Zheng discovered there was a transceiver underneath. “Mao Ba’er, I reckon that thing just now hasn’t left. Why would a demon want to attack me? Aren’t they scared of death?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Late-stage Qi Condensation, but it’s really weird. The qi fluctuations are pretty irregular. The highest value doesn’t surpass the peak of the initial stage. For the most part, the target maintained a normal level at the initial stage. It was no lower or greater than yours.”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A male voice could be heard from the transceiver.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To speculate the root cause, this demon’s mind must be extremely messed up due to some unknown situation. We, as demon hunters, have to lose a normal way of thinking and depend on the subconscious mind to act. It’s quite likely that it’s taken you as its target. Have you heard of the Lighthouse Theory? The two of you are like two lighthouses. You can see it, and it can smell you. As for why, that’s beyond my ability to speculate. However, there are already two sure facts. You wanna hear?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi nodded. As if the other side had seen the same, Mao Ba’er subsequently said,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One: from an examination of the victims’ wounds and the degree of the target’s strength just now, the demon form confirms it as the true culprit of Sanshui City’s serial killer case.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two: in the event that it’s the objective of the graduation exam, you’ll have more than ten points added on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief Zheng hadn’t heard the conversation. Instead, an expression of tired relief stretched over his face as he looked at Xu Yangyi. He constrained himself for a while but ultimately said, “Young… Captain Xu, this business… you… sir…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Relax.” Xu Yangyi hung up the transceiver, looking at Chief Zheng who had terror stretching over his entire face. He raised his brows. “I said so. I’m a ‘professional’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Otherwise, how could you invite me to come from so far away, while criticizing me with your heads down to lead this unit?”</span></p>
