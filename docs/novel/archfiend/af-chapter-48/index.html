Fortunately, there weren’t any cultivation reporters present, since the Heavens Law graduation ceremony’s talent selection didn’t allow such a thing. Nonetheless, the people below had already witnessed the roughness of the recruiters’ breathing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The audience now clearly recognized what the Big Three was. They didn’t need money to recruit someone. Their resources, information, methods, and connections, these were all their conditions! These conditions… were something that the other cultivation clans didn’t possess by any stretch of the imagination!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they had finally understood something! It wasn’t because the Featherwood Guard was special did Xu Yangyi make an inquiry to them, but rather they put forth that they would help him find his assailant!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had forgotten… What was the death of Xu Yangyi’s parents in concerns to their own trifling matters? At this instant, the expression in a few people’s eyes finally cooled down from a mad heat and changed into a kind of distant… perseverance!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a Core Formation arcane effort in his grasp, his own fiendish aptitude, and tempting conditions, Xu Yangyi surprisingly didn’t care for his future status or resources, but the blood hatred of his mother and father?</span></p>

Hehe… Lilac, you should know that the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion has the ‘Clairvoyance-1’ microsatellite outside of China’s atmosphere. It can’t monitor all of China, but as long as Fellow Daoist Xu’s enemy shows sign of either hide or hair, headquarters will be able to lock down on it for Fellow Daoist Xu in a day!” Vulture sneered.&nbsp;</span></p>

A real massive manhunt! Fellow Daoist Xu, all you have to do is agree, and once our signing is completed, the guild master’s command will be immediately issued!” Hibiscus continued to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion and the Featherwood Guard’s plan to throw her off rhythm?</span></p>

Just as he stood up, a fierce tsunami-like spiritual pressure abruptly swept overhead in the sky!&nbsp;</span></p>

His mood fluctuations were already under control, but this person’s name was somewhat familiar. He seemed to have heard it from somewhere before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why would I dare not to?” Wang Buzhi laughed grimly, “105 years ago, old me chanced upon the world-shaking Hinayana Pill formula. If it weren’t for all the Foundation Establishment cultivators coming to rob me, I wouldn’t have had to live in secrecy for the past century.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi recalled who he was!</span></p>

This art declined terribly, and any ancient pill formula was a priceless treasure. The branch had vaguely explained that within the past century, there was an extremely famous pill formula known as the Core Formation Pill, the world-shaking Hinayana Pill formula. An initial-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator named Wang Buzhi, the Featherwood Guard, and a few other registered agents had searched together and discovered an ancient remnant. However, they had attracted all kinds of pursuers from the light and dark afterwards. From this ancient remnant to civilized regions, no less than 300 Foundation Establishment cultivators had died along this path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t until the very end did the law enforcement of Nantong Province’s Cultivation Court act to settle this matter. Nonetheless, the item in question that could increase the success rate of a cultivator making pills by an additional 10% had disappeared without a trace, Wang Buzhi nowhere to be found as well. The only result that had come out of this was the registration of the “world-shaking Hinayana Pill” in the cultivation property rights protection court.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Originally, I wasn’t planning on accepting a disciple. In the past century, I’ve seen that human nature is cold and indifferent…” Wang Buzhi glanced at Firecloud and Shadowslay with an incomparably derisive expression. “But even under the circumstances of this child’s bright future, he has surprisingly put the vengeance of his mother and father first. I feel it would be better to accept him as a disciple than some of the gathered wild dogs.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, join my sect, and I, Wang Buzhi, will assist you in crafting pills so long as you can take this step! In the entire world, only I possess this pill formula!”</span></p>

I’m not sure who it was that year who said to split things evenly, but in the end robbed us and ran off. Fellow Daoist Xu, this old fox’s words cannot be trusted. Besides…” Firecloud glanced scornfully at the old man. “Aren’t you unable to produce pills at the Great Circle of Foundation Establishment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Fellow Daoist Xu enters my Cloudwind Valley, I swear to use my full strength to search for his parents’ enemy!”&nbsp;</span></p>

They knew their opportunity wasn’t great, but didn’t they have one even though their chances weren’t substantial?&nbsp;</span></p>

At that time, everyone would be face-to-face, holding a candle and conversing at night. The only things they were investing were their good faith and time. Their gains might be a future “possible” Core Formation master!</span></p>

The path of cultivation was such that the price of a single misstep could possibly be one’s own life!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was regardless of whether or not you were a genius, normal person, or had some kind of treasure in hand.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was the only existing path.&nbsp;</span></p>

In fact, the boy could come out whenever, but wouldn’t it be a slap to himself if he let Xu Yangyi out ahead of time when he had said an hour?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone quieted down. In their minds, these words were clearly directed towards the Big Three, but several hundred voices echoed on the spot. “Fellow Daoist, please speak!”</span></p>

This request would be no easy matter… Not one bit!</span></p>

Searching for the unfound killer of Xu Yangyi’s parents would be no simple task for anyone!</span></p>

He wanted revenge for this slight. However, this goal couldn’t be given voice. At the very least, he couldn’t say it so frankly right now.&nbsp;</span></p>

He still didn’t have the strength of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and as for the people in the VIP section…&nbsp;</span></p>

To clarify his own status, he wasn’t a Foundation Establishment senior, and he still didn’t exactly understand how great the power was of each special envoy’s organization. In addition, the few people who had remained silent were mortals. Nonetheless, their statuses to sit in the VIP section already demonstrated that their identities were by no means ordinary!</span></p>

The only possibility was that his failure had come from someone in the VIP section because there just wasn’t anyone else that had the qualifications to access the arena’s qi-severing mechanism. He had a premonition that this person couldn’t be questioned.&nbsp;</span></p>

If that’s how matters would stand, his convictions would be unrealized! In the future, he would remember the cruel fact that as he had once stood before that door, someone had ruthlessly pulled him away!&nbsp;</span></p>

The area beyond the qi walls was quiet for a period of time, as well. After a long moment, Xu Yangyi’s voice, full of hidden meaning, finally echoed, “I failed to break through, yesterday. Originally, I should’ve advanced to the middle stage of Qi Condensation, but someone severed the worldly qi at the most critical moment.”&nbsp;</span></p>

There were definitely others. No, not to even mention Foundation Establishment cultivators, if even the thousands of Qi Condensation cultivators presented a petition with the name of a Foundation Establishment cultivator attached, perhaps even he, the deputy minister, would really have to chug down a pot of tea!</span></p>

He was terribly shaken. He truly was in a dreadfully panicked state. Right now, even fear had taken his heart. If this Xu wanted to get to the bottom of this matter, what would he do?!</span></p>

After ages, Vulture gritted his teeth. “Although the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion doesn’t know who caused Fellow Daoist Xu to fail his advancement, we shall investigate with no stone left unturned. In case it’s discovered, the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion will cease services with that person for half a year!”&nbsp;</span></p>

Perhaps Qi Condensation cultivators wouldn’t be able to guess who was able to do such a thing, but Foundation Establishment cultivators like them could guess through a process of elimination! How many people in a Heavens Law branch were capable of such action? What kind of position did these few people have?</span></p>
