 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hallmaster Vulture!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture waved his hands, gritting his teeth and standing up. From the beginning he saw Xu Yangyi, he knew that the Featherwood Guard was going to bleed out an exorbitant sum of money. Yet he hadn’t expected whatsoever that Xu Yangyi had also unleashed his neurons! On the airplane, he, Lilac, and Hibiscus had been embroiled in conflict. It was stated back then that a signing bonus of several fold would be given if one had activated their neurons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Nonetheless, confronted with the Featherwood Guard’s great financial showing, Vulture didn’t think of this. He’d only anticipated that Xu Yangyi’s involvement in the Vermilion Snow Incident and the slaying of a God Ming successor would certainly raise his worth a bit. Who knew… that Xu Yangyi had also activated his neurons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wasn’t it you that fucking asked us in any case?! Why would you go and stay in a backwater place like the Featherwood Guard?! You think big bro ain’t got the cash? You think I won’t lift up forty tons of spirit stones and smash you to death?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The upper bound of spirit stones that he could mobilize as a hall master was thirty tons. He didn’t believe that he couldn’t apply for ten more tons for the paragon of that year who had survived Vermilion Snow’s hand, slain a God Ming successor, and held a Core Formation arcane effort in his hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jingle…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A telephone suddenly rang out. Vulture was terribly unwilling to take the call at first, but once he glanced at the number he picked up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old Vulture, he’s still alive.” Lilac’s voice floated over, “About that poor ghost of a Featherwood Guard, they’ve really dished out a hefty sum.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where are you guys going to easily get the cash, anyways? How many project professors are there with our support?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Vulture curled his lip. He held in his belly of hot anger and said, “It’s no problem… I’m not fuckin’ convinced that the Featherwood Guard’s contract will be continued for the greater part of thirty years. I don’t believe… I won’t be able to sign that kid down for the next thirty-year cycle!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know that Xu Yangyi simply hadn’t considered the other two organizations. In his heart, there existed an insane plot. And so with this scheme, he didn’t want to defraud the other factions. He only wanted to scam Floatingcloud! To merely swindle the Mingshui Province Featherwood Guard that held intimate relations with Floatingcloud!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Vulture and Lilac’s end, along with everyone else in front of their computers, they would be astonished by this information. A cultivator who unleashed their neurons was an existence that maybe wouldn’t even be among a thousand people. And those who activated their neurons to S-rank… numbered few in all of China! Although almost everyone at the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion and CSIB weren’t master pill-elixirist, they had some instruction. As for the Featherwood Guard?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huehue… the projects of other master pill-elixirist, for example the conversion of some ancient medicinal pill, were projects which consumed a calculated portion that demanded tens of thousands of spirit stones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And those were middle-grade spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Featherwood Guard was a large-scale mercenary corps and illegal military force that took a percentage of earnings. If they wanted to support the projects of ten-odd professors or masters, while it wasn’t out of the question, it would surely put a strain on their liquid funds. Moreover… who said that an alchemy recovery project would succeed in one trial?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after throwing in several times to over a dozen times of tens of thousands of spirit stones would there be success and the birth of a registered brand. Only a peak moneybags like the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion and a government-backed power like the CSIB could shoulder this. Right now, the Featherwood Guard had purchased horse bones for a thousand pounds of gold. Thinking of this, the minds of many, many people eased in relief. <span id="footnote-ref-4be3"><a href="#footnote-4be3">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s how it is… that’s how it actually is. Then I can accept it.” A cultivator in front of a computer sighed deeply. There was nothing to be done. Talent was unequal among men. It couldn’t be incurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think everybody has no further doubts, yes?” Thousandedge laughed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone all shook their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, because the Featherwood Guard hasn’t developed a pill elixir facility, young friend Xu will get to choose to apply to the CSIB’s newcomer support project within the approaching three years…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Vulture’s end of the phone, Lilac immediately hung up. Vulture felt himself to have suffered double the blow!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why? You didn’t even ask me! I was frickin’ ready to go, just itching to go! Although the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion doesn’t have that program, we can draw up a new one again! We can talk it over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a ten-odd minute speech, Xu Yangyi took a thick resource folder in his hand. It was different from a mortal paper folder, rather a folder of jade slips. He let a drop of fresh blood fall on it and used his spiritual sense to engrave a brand on the red liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mission success. Henceforth, he would no longer be the uncertain wanderer Xu Yangyi. Instead, he would be a legion commander of Mingshui Province’s Featherwood Guard! An A-rank legion commander!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I still need to request Commander Xu to christen his legion and determine an enlistment date.” The middle-aged man finally calmed down, solemnly put away the bamboo slip, and laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi mused to himself and laughed towards a camera. “My legion shall be named Xingtian.” <span id="footnote-ref-27f6"><a href="#footnote-27f6">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How cool! How domineering!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A billion is waiting for you! Fellow Daoist Xu! Speak! I will forever strive my hardest towards your objective!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chinacultivation.com was already in a mass of chaos. Love-smitten female cultivators and jealous male cultivators began to post countless messages. They esteemed Foundation Establishment seniors and admired Core Formation masters even more, however… how could these figures find common ground compared to Qi Condensation cultivators? It had to be known that at least 70% of the cultivation world were Qi Condensation cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi mumbled for a brief moment, “There are no conditions. All that’s required is to undergo my test and then one can join the Xingtian Legion. The evaluation time is not presently set, but will be extremely short. In a few years, I hope everyone will still be paying attention.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, we’ll be following closely! So many hidden treasures are waiting for us to divvy up. How could we possibly not be interested?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unknown how many people made a resolution in silence. Starting tomorrow, they would take note of each scrap of information regarding the Xingtian Legion on Chinacultivation.com. By no means would they relinquish a single bit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, Thousandedge laughed as he walked over to Xu Yangyi’s side and shook hands. “The signing is a great success. Young friend Xu, from this day onwards you’re an agent of Mingshui Province’s Featherwood Guard. The legion commander of the A-rank Xingtian Legion. I hope that you’ll be able to formally complete legion registration within a month and hand over your legion insignia to the Featherwood Guard’s statistics department, so that people can make assignments and appointments.”</span></p>

In the wake of each of his steps, the temperature became fractionally colder. Ultimately, all that existed beneath his feet was chilling ice. “Your nerve sure is big enough…” He inhaled deeply, and his hand stroked a door to a room. “In these two or three years… I’ll have to let you run rampant for the time being…”</span></p>

A faint smile played at the corner of his mouth. Who was it that said one had to live in hiding to evade a manhunt? Different times had different ways of handling things. He stood in front of the person who wanted to kill him and made off with all his rewards from three years ago. Moreover, he even specifically announced that he’d unshackled his neurons, causing this reward to become even more significant. That was because…</span></p>

A Core Formation cultivator’s Black Kill Order was like a hanging blade above his head. So long as he stayed here and didn’t make a move, absolutely no one would be able to take action against him. However, once he left the city and began taking missions or entering vast desolaces, swamplands, barrens, and secret realms…&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p>1. Spent a thousand pounds of gold on horse bones. Old Chinese tale. Gist of this is that one spends a lot of money on something to display sincerity. An emperor wanted to buy a horse that could travel a thousand li in a single day, but couldn’t find one. His attendant hatched a plan and used the emperor’s gold to buy the skeleton of a horse. The emperor was upset, but was happy when people started bringing horses because of how sincere they thought he was. <a href="#footnote-ref-4be3"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>2. Xingtian = 刑天. Haha, we’ve finally reached this part. Probably one of the reasons I chose to translate this novel is because Xu Yangyi names his legion the Xingtian Legion. The XT part of my web handle is Xing Tian. Xingtian is god in Chinese myth that had his head chopped off, but his nipples turned into eyes and his belly button into a mouth, so he could fight on. Xingtian Legion can also be translated directly as “Opposing Heaven”. <a href="#footnote-ref-27f6"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
