 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mao Ba’er stood up like a human with a swish and pulled the door open. “Look! No one’s even here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi raised a brow as well. Indeed, there wasn’t even one person. Then… the question was, what had he just heard moments ago?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had clearly heard someone named Manager Su at the door talking loudly. Manager Su and Mao Ba’er had spoken quite clearly on a cooperative arrangement, price, and share, however… there really wasn’t anyone at the entrance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t there someone at the left? Someone that wanted the doctor to change their medication?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dog scouted out and returned. “Nobody at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Was it your imagination?” Mao Ba’er looked at Xu Yangyi suspiciously. “In fact… even if you brag, we’ll still be good friends… if you’re willing to give me a clear explanation about how you learned of my deal with the Bountiful Treasures Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi narrowed his eyes and didn’t answer the other. Instead, he released his spiritual sense. A thought sprang into his mind. Perhaps… it wasn’t a trick of the ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he unleashed his spiritual sense, he immediately felt it was different, a totally clear difference from before! In the past, his spiritual sense had also been clear, but in comparison to now it seemed to have once been covered with a film of mist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flower was red. Yet in his eyes, he sensed even more layers of red that were more vibrant, like he could clearly see its color composition. To the extent that he could see the honeybee on the flower vibrating its wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Or perhaps it could be said in such a way that the world had become even more realistic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in a sickroom on the tenth floor, but the flower garden was on a lower level outside the hospital, nearly 150 meters at the side of the national highway! Even if he was a Qi Condensation cultivator, he shouldn’t have been able to see something 150 meters away to the most minute detail! A hundred meters was the max!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But more importantly was sound. Every sound, the buzzing of the honeybee’s wings, the discussion of the patients on the floor below, and the hailing of a car 200 meters away… seemed to be at the side of his ear. He could even hear the middle-aged driver slightly cough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes slightly narrowed. He hadn’t heard incorrectly… Instead, his spiritual sense had unexpectedly strengthened! Moreover, it had suddenly expanded by roughly a third!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi forcibly suppressed the throbbing of his heart. To a cultivator, spiritual sense could be said to be on the same level of importance as their qi sea. It was the eyes, ears, and tongue of how cultivators perceived the world, equivalent to a human’s five senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It also comprised the perception and absorption strength of qi! In other words, his perception and absorption rate of qi was over a third stronger than a same-stage cultivator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An art or treasure that could upgrade spiritual sense wouldn’t exist these days by any stretch of the imagination! This era of Cultivation Civilization was also known as Saddharmavipralopa, or the End of Days. Qi had already become incomparably thin, and matters such as cultivating to Foundation Establishment in a hundred days, like in novels, could no longer appear. Presently, to achieve Foundation Establishment in a hundred years was considered top-notch. Spiritual sense would only advance following a cultivator’s elevation in realms. Never had there been a precedent for such a sudden advancement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pretty boy… you alright?” Like a dried well, Xu Yangyi’s complexion was without a single ripple. Mao Ba’er asked nervously, “Is it… because you didn’t rest well enough that you’re suddenly hearing things?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maybe.” Xu Yangyi shut his eyes and leaned against the sickbed. “Pack things up. In several days, we’re going to leave Sanshui City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knock knock knock…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;At the same time, a knocking sound rang out. As he called out for the knocker to enter, Xu Yangyi saw a large bouquet of flowers with over a dozen people following behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all officers from the Disciplinary and Investigations Unit. This time, all of them were present! They followed the lead of Vice Captain Chen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain Xu, has your health improved?” Vice Captain Chen respectfully set the large bouquet of flowers on a table and stood sincerely at Xu Yangyi’s bedside. “I heard you’ve been unconscious for over ten days. We’re really sorry; we didn’t think that scumbag would’ve set up explosives. If it weren’t for you, Captain Xu… We don’t even know if we’d be able to see our children again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vice Captain Chen’s words revealed heartfelt admiration, deference, and respect. His aggression from the past several days when Xu Yangyi had just taken up post had long since disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just doing my job.” Xu Yangyi looked at the big bouquet of sword lilies—symbols of good health—and laughed, “Thank you for the flowers, everyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“T-There’s no need for thanks… No, I want to say that Captain Xu doesn’t need to give thanks!” Old Zhu took a step forward and sighed deeply, “Some people said you were a paratrooper before. They said you were sent down to fill the numbers, and I actually believed it, too… Captain Xu, we… we…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We declined the commendations of the Provincial Public Security Department.” Vice Captain Chen revealed a shameful look. “Captain Xu… we were all waiting on you, but they didn’t want to hold off any longer. The case has been dragging on for too long. You might not know, but Sanshui City has been so worried for the past month that even night classes were canceled. There was no one on the street… They wanted to announce this information at once, I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need to apologize.” Xu Yangyi didn’t care at all. Calming the people’s hearts was the first order of business after a strange incident. “This is what you should’ve done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mood inside the hospital room had become a bit awkward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, none of them were used to looking at Xu Yangyi. For a paratrooper to drop down all of a sudden and then take charge over a major case was akin to a sheep leading a pride of lions. Above all else though, they had nearly flown into a seething rage when Xu Yangyi had stated that he was personally handling the case. <span id="footnote-ref-4869"><a href="#footnote-4869">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t until they regained consciousness that they became aware that Xu Yangyi had saved their lives at the key moment. According to the report, their close proximity to the explosives the criminal had planted had led to partial memory lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking back to their display in the past, they drummed up enough courage to get together and come visit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was embarrassing… how could they set face aside? They were all in their thirties and forties, but they had judged Xu Yangyi by his appearance. In the end, he had saved all of their lives and single-handedly apprehended the criminal. When Chief Zheng had announced this information, the entire police force had been left without words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief period of shock, their guilt had swelled forth like a tide, and yet… they were embarrassed. After stewing around for a good while, it wasn’t until these feelings had reached their boiling point that they carefully selected a large bouquet of flowers, and came together to the sickroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there anything else?” Xu Yangyi had roughly grasped their intentions. “I have to get re-examined soon, and I’ll be transferred afterwards. How about all of you wait for me to leave the hospital, and then we’ll chat again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Transferred?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their feelings of embarrassment weakened in a flash and were replaced with a bubbling reluctance to part ways. Everyone looked at each other in surprise. They seemed to recall that Xu Yangyi had indeed said that he would be transferred after the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, they had been overwhelmingly in support for such a thing! But now…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they had been quite willing in the past, they were just as reluctant now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was this a joke?! Which department wouldn’t be willing to have such a friggin’ awesome captain? Not to mention a mortal achieving the Dao, even chickens and dogs would ascend to the heavens and reap an abundant harvest by staying under another’s tutelage! <span id="footnote-ref-ab80"><a href="#footnote-ab80">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain Xu!” Vice Captain Chen pursed his lips, suddenly stood up, and bowed seriously. “I apologize!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Together with him at the head, everyone behind him bowed at the waist and said in chorus, “Our apologies!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine.” Xu Yangyi shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was about to speak, Vice Captain Chen immediately followed up. “No! There’s something else! If I don’t say this, I’m afraid I won’t be able to sleep peacefully later on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the beginning, we judged you by your cover. Captain Xu… I truly didn’t expect… that you would be s-so…” Old Zhu pursed his lips, reflected over his words for two seconds, and then said wholeheartedly, “Awesome, frickin’ awesome! Nobody dared to accept this case in Nantong Province, but you busted it in three days flat! I, Old Zhu, accepted the last-sitting captain, Captain Gong. Now, I accept you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain Xu, please accept our apologies.” Officer Qin said as well. “We didn’t bring a present, but these are our heartfelt feelings. If it’s because of our past attitudes that have drawn your misunderstanding…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I guarantee it absolutely won’t happen again!” Vice Captain Chen stood up straight and patted his chest. “Say no more. I accept this captain. Based on qualifications, it originally should’ve been my turn. However, only those who are capable may take this seat! If you tell us to go south later on, we sure as hell won’t go north!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi understood. They didn’t want him to leave…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Concerning Vice Captain Chen’s apology, he really didn’t put it to mind. Even though things had been difficult before, he hadn’t even taken it to heart. This was because he wasn’t a person walking parallel with them. This wasn’t belittling them, but rather that which angered him was different from the root of ordinary people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of their superiors making things hard for them, annoying colleagues, and increases in prices, ordinary people would swear up a storm in public, but he wouldn’t. He was only anxious if his cultivation was unable to make progress, simply worried he wouldn’t see the end of the Grand Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry.” He stood up and was supported up by his colleagues of barely several days. “This is a command from the top of the chain. My coming here was only to handle this case. I’ve finished, so I have to return.” His words were clear and to the point. Anyone could hear that this was a matter that couldn’t be disobeyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t… Can’t the rules be bent?” Vice Captain Chen gritted his teeth, irreconcilably. With such a capable captain, he truly didn’t wish for someone else to transfer Xu Yangyi out!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi shook his head and laughed, “There’s a chance we’ll meet again.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even when all officers left the sickroom, their hearts were still at odds with Xu Yangyi’s coming departure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, Old Chen, do you even remember what happened that night?” Old Zhu furrowed his brows and asked, “I can’t remember anything at all… I only remember… it seemed that something incredibly serious happened… We owe Captain Xu a pretty big favor…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t remember, either…” Vice Captain Chen smiled wryly and shook his head. “However, I’m in the same boat as you. I keep getting a nudge at the back of my mind that if it weren’t for him that night, we all would’ve died there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me too!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s weird… It’s the same for me as well.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I keep on thinking that I owe him a big favor, but I can’t even recall anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the line of people descended downstairs, Vice Captain Chen was the last to raise his head and look back towards the sickroom on the tenth floor. He kept on having a kind of feeling. That perhaps this would be the last time he would see Xu Yangyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected…” He shook his head and followed after the crowd. “How could a talented person possibly be willing to stay in such a backwater place like Sanshui City…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The blinds lowered, and Xu Yangyi gently raised a slat, his gaze wavering a tad bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Are you a little sad you don’t have any mortal friends?” Mao Ba’er stood beside him, using his paw in the same manner to brush the blinds aside. “Pretty boy… we haven’t been normal people for a long time… This society is at peace from the outside but beneath it lies a maelstrom of living fossils that have crawled along since ancient times… Besides, existences like ours is beyond ordinary people. Who said it? For the paths we have chosen, we must press on to completion even if we are brought to our knees.” <span id="footnote-ref-3c20"><a href="#footnote-3c20">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clack…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The blinds softly lowered, and Xu Yangyi laughed, “It’s rare for you to speak like a human. Help me get in touch with Sanshui City’s Bountiful Treasures Pavilion. I need to get an appraisal right away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi tapped his wristwatch. “Of course, I have to submit my exam grade now.”</span></p>

  <p>1. 兵熊熊一个，将熊熊一窝. Kinda hard to translate this into english. I used the example I found to demonstrate what it means. Essentially, it illustrates that if you’re team is good, but leader sucks, you will suck. But if your leader is amazing and the team is amazing, then you guys will be awesome. <a href="#footnote-ref-4869"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>

 <div id="footnote-ab80">
  <p>2. Chickens and dogs can rise to the heavens. I was originally going to localize this, but I love the imagery LOL. I played around with the sentence to make it fit. If it isn’t obvious, it means that anyone can do anything (given a situation in context). Also, “Achieving the Dao” is a term you’ll often find for someone ascending to immortality/becoming an immortal. <a href="#footnote-ref-ab80"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>

  <p>3. 自己选的路，跪着也要走完 - I translated this kinda loosely and bit poetic, but the meaning from what I have ascertained is “the paths we choose in life hold all kinds of hardship. Despite this, we have to continue on bravely even in the face of danger.” <a href="#footnote-ref-3c20"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>
