 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Branch Master.” The slightest trace of respect was absent from a young cultivator’s face. There was only unrestrainable anxiety. “Connections are already finished! What are we going to do next! Your immediate command!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could no longer manage respect. His heart was now as restless as an inferno! One late step might spell their deaths here!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet waiting for Xu Yangyi here were the resignation letters of all the legions under command! After waiting so long, the branch master hadn’t arrived or replied. None of them could wait, composing orderly and clear-cut missives. All of them were applications to quit being a legion commander!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From A-rank above to C-rank below, there was no exception! A position that left one envious in the eyes of ordinary cultivators was now incomparable with the preciousness of life. Apart from a thick stack of resignation letters and a warehouse of medium-grade spirit stones, there was nothing else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Return to your posts.” Xu Yangyi’s expression was motionless, and he gently waved his hand. All the resignation letters transformed into flying ash. “Get ready… to commence total war with the four great clans!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Xu!” Just as Xu Yangyi’s voice fell, a cultivator couldn’t help but cry out. “H-How is this alright?! We’re not the opponents of the four clans in any way! All they have to do is is extend a finger, and we’ll be crushed to death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi coolly furrowed his brows, and the look in his eyes transformed from chilling-iciness to danger. He uttered, “I said… return to your post.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fellow Daoist Xu.” Before he even finished speaking, another fat cultivator gritted their teeth and said, “This is a death wish! We stayed to make contact! Not to follow you staking your life away! And not to get killed with you, either! I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you or do you not belong to the Longsu Province Featherwood Guard?” Chu Zhaonan laughed grimly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fat cultivator swallowed his next words all into his stomach, yet he raised his head and glared daggers at Xu Yangyi several seconds later. “I want to resign! I resign!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys are courting death!” His expression was somewhat malevolent. This day was the longest day he had ever spent. When Longsu Province received notice that a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator had been promoted to branch master, the Featherwood Guard broke into an uproar! And then, news immediately arrived that Nanzhou was to be demarcated for war! They had been made to stay behind and make contact, fearing that Xu Yangyi would come fight. So as terror consumed them, they waited for the new branch master, while in the grip of fear. Originally, they had even wanted to feel out whether the new branch master would immediately raise a white flag and protect lives. In that case, they could continue following along with the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the beginning of yesterday, the fat cultivator’s heart strings had been stretched taut, and he had waited anxiously for the branch master to come. He hadn’t expected that Xu Yangyi’s first command upon just arriving would be to prepare total battle commencement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is he insane?!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His nerves, strained tightly until now, finally snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look outside!” His expression was emotional as he pointed outside the window. “The Bluedawn Winding Corridor! The White Tiger Hall! The Kindling Mulberry Wall! Which one isn’t the name of a palace that shakes the cultivator world? And us?!” His voice was somewhat hoarse as his finger cut in front of the people before him in a circle. “Just over sixty people?! The others have a thousand ready armies! At one mouthful of spit per person, aren’t they able to drown us to death?! And you’re planning to use the branch to ram into their palaces?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Already, Xu Yangyi’s eyes were a blizzard of icy-coldness. He stood up and walked in front of the complaining cultivator. “I’ll give you one last chance. Return to your station,” he paused. “This is the Branch Master’s command.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“NO!!!” The cultivator’s voice became even louder, and he roared at Xu Yangyi. “I refuse to accept orders! I don’t want to go die with you! I want to resign! I’ve going to appeal to Ancestor Ancientpine! I’m going…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice yet to abate, he was unable to continue speaking. In shock, he looked at his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hand had already run through his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eyes wide and mouth dumb, he looked at the cool-faced Xu Yangyi in front of him. The branch master didn’t even have the faintest ripple on his face from killing him face to face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those who disturb the army’s heart, kill.” Xu Yangyi was bereft of the slightest mote of pity. In a time like this, to lose any one of the army’s heart, morale, and battle intent was enough to consign them to eternal damnation, nothing less than ten thousand calamities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Squelch.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;As his hand pulled out, an arrow of blow shot out. The fat cultivator’s eyes were round, yet he looked at Xu Yangyi with fixed eyes as before. He dared not accept it… The new branch master had actually killed him just like that…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You didn’t leave before, so now you want to act like an indecisive rat for me?” Xu Yangyi took a silk handkerchief that Li Zongyuan offered and casually wiped his hands. He looked at the twenty-something people in front of him. “Last time. Return to your stations.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s an order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silence. Three seconds later, a cultivator’s legs went soft, and he tumbled to the ground with a thud. Soon afterwards, his hands sprung up to clasp in greeting. His lips quivered, wanting to say something, yet nothing left his mouth. He got up, turned around, and left towards the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those who flee before battle, kill.” Xu Yangyi said calmly, lighting a cigarette and taking a deep drag. “Those who fear battle and do not advance, kill. Since you’ve followed me here, I’ll be the first to charge. I’m not retreating, and whoever wants to flee…” His gaze swept across everyone, and his voice was icy-cold like a blade. “Don’t blame me for being merciless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There could not be a shred of kindness at such a time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Understood!” Everyone yelled in response and hammered their chests in unison, shock overtaking them. Even Chu Zhaonan and Lord Zhao cupped their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yangyi’s hand stroked the top of his storage ring but ultimately released it. Right now still wasn’t the time to activate the Taiyi Everlasting Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over twenty people departed with ashen faces. Merely, two people shared a glance with each other and gritted their teeth as they stood in the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“W-We’re the contact crew in charge of the master hall.” The duo didn’t wait for Xu Yangyi to speak and stammered out, not daring to look at him. “W-We’ve come to handover the master hall’s arrangements to Fellow Dao… Branch Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their hearts, they were already as silent like a cicada in winter. As expected… no one able to reach the branch master’s seat was easy to get along with. In the same vein, this branch master was no good samaritan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Speak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The two cultivators stood at both sides and weaved seals. Suddenly, a screen of light floated into view before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>

On its surface, even their surroundings were gathered with several hundred little red dots. Lord Zhao furrowed his brows. “In that case, what’s this big red dot?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the position his finger pointed to, tens of little red dots, subordinate to a giant red dot, suddenly broke free of ranks and rushed towards their location.</span></p>

In the instant they saw the large red dot, they were stunned for two seconds and then screeched at the top of their lungs. “Enemy attack! ENEMY ATTACK!!!”</span></p>

The thuds of heavy footsteps immediately followed! Each noise seemed to tread on one’s heart. Furthermore… they were getting increasingly near! Louder and louder!</span></p>

In a twinkling, all cultivators hurried straight to the other two palaces! Based on the norms of a stronghold, the central region was the master hall, and the two branch pavilions were the armories.</span></p>

To come to this warzone, he had made blood-soaked preparations long ago. However, anything could happen on the battlefield. Any mishap would follow on the heels and come. Yet he hadn’t foreseen that a mishap would come so fast! His soldiers basically had no time to familiarize themselves with the stronghold, yet the first attack wave was already before their eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any wasted words, the group hastily left the main hall. Outside, the entire stronghold was already glimmering with golden light, like a hedgehog with raised quills. It was a warning to all attacking invaders. However, at the end of the horizon was a titanic shadow, the Bluedawn Winding Corridor that had a beam of spiritual light directly penetrating the sky. The beam was snow-white and linked to the crown of the structure. Thundering through the air, the stronghold wildly stormed towards them!</span></p>

Each arm wielded a magik artifact that was several tens of meters long! The rise of a hand seemed capable of ripping apart the clouds, and the lift of a foot was like ten thousand stampeding horses! Runes were inscribed all over its body from top to bottom. Looking at it far away in the dust and smoke all around, the behemoth was akin to a rushing fiend, seizing control of the hearts and souls of men!</span></p>

His hand gripped a longspear, exposing the meager sleeve of his robe that was rippling loudly in his mad dash. His objective was pointed straight to Featherwood Guard.</span></p>

The hundred-strong assault unit were all the true elites. Yet it wasn’t like this anymore, over a dozen of them bringing tens of ready soldiers. In the place where the Xingtian Legion had crushed the Screaming Wind Legion’s elities, it was unknown what shameful method the Xingtian Legion had used. Nevertheless, their squad of ten-odd true elites couldn’t mount a clash of blows again. After all, death was no longer avail to the Linghu Clan!</span></p>

  <p>1. “Nice way to shift trouble on someone else = 祸水东引”. Another specific Chinese adage. Originates from the ancient kingdom of Chu (770-223 BCE). Duke Huan of Qi attacks the state of Chu. The king of Chu says, “Why?” The scholar Guan Zhong (645~ BCE) points out that the state of Chu did not pay tribute on time and that some guy had failed to comeback from a river. Thus, the state of Chu took the blame. Unfortunately, this one was too Chinese for me to do it literally. <a href="#footnote-ref-17ad"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></p>
