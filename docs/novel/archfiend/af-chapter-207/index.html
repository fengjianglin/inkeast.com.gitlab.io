 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 207: Danxia Temple (26)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go, Commander!” Quan Ningyue abruptly thumped the hammer in her hand. “Secret realm… This is Danxia Temple’s actual secret realm! The things from before… were nothing more than just its appetizers!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others didn’t say much, but their expressions already betrayed their inner hearts. Their faces were eager and restless, jumping to give this secret realm a try. No one could mask this, yet none of them simply wanted to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they looked over in doubt, and Xu Yangyi seriously turned around. On his serene face, his gaze was like lightning, sweeping over their faces one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s something that I haven’t told everyone.” Xu Yangyi lit a cigarette, leaned against the side of the cavern, and said insipidly, “All of you have to decide whether or not to walk the following path.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Zhao Wuye looked at him in confusion. Before he even finished speaking, he was interrupted by Xu Yangyi’s raised hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This here.” Xu Yangyi used his foot to stomp the ground. “Is Danxia Temple’s true door.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silence, but after three seconds, it was broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you saying!? B-B-Behind this is… is…” Peony covered her mouth in astonishment and fell back three steps. “D-D-D-Danxia Temple’s central region?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was stupefied. No one knew what Danxia Temple looked like and furthermore didn’t know where Danxia Temple’s outer temple and inner temple were located. Traveling throughout this journey was terribly dangerous, but from the beginning to the end, they still believed the distance from Danxia Temple was quite far. Nonetheless, Xu Yangyi was now telling them:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You all thought wrong. Just now was only the appetizer. We’re already standing in front of Danxia Temple’s door!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… Fellow Daoist, how do you know?” Zhao Fenglai asked incredulously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s my business.” Xu Yangyi stomped out the cigarette butt. “I’ll only tell you of this fact. After this Transference Formation is the true Danxia Temple. As for myself, I’m going in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one followed up with a word. None of them dared to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ominous name of the Eight Great Deadlands was too terrible and mighty. As the personnel of the Xingtian Legion pondered this, they realized this was the place where their commander had resolved to test his blade since the very beginning. He’d long since taken aim at Danxia Temple’s central region! Talking about exploring the surroundings was nothing more than a pretense!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi said nothing either. From the start, he’d indeed planned on exploring the surroundings. However… as he truly walked before the honeycomb wall, he discovered that he couldn’t do so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Animus Armament’s summons, a path of countless secrets, the curiosity in his heart, and the blood in his veins were all screaming:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Go down and look! Even if hell is below!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He chose to follow the heart. The Zhao Clan’s people were also dumbstruck. Danxia Temple… This name could even make cultivators change color upon hearing it! They never thought that they had actually excavated Danxia Temple’s front door! They moreover hadn’t thought that behind this honeycomb wall… was the true Danxia Temple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… back side, is Fellow Daoist certain that it’s Danxia Temple?” Zhao Wuye even felt this to be too much of a fantasy. The noun “Danxia Temple” was too distantly removed from Qi Condensation cultivators. He doubted if what he’d just heard was merely a trick of the ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m very certain. So much that I’m going to tell everyone that the danger from before compared to the next side…” Xu Yangyi’s gaze looked towards the cavern’s depths. “Is only a single hair from nine oxen. The space below is very large. Moreover… there’s a demon with a massive demon form. I don’t know whether it’s good or evil. It’s a living creature.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single sentence caused everyone to tremble. After ages, Li Zongyuan said with his voice shaking, “H-How b-big is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At least a thousand meters,” Xu Yangyi said calmly. “I saw a photo. In the area where the photo was taken, the demon was already over a thousand meters. How long it is specifically is unknown. Based on its shape, it might be a fish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Over… a thousand meters…” Zhao Fenglai fell back two steps. His complexion was a pale stretch, devoid of the slightest color. Cultivators realized the meaning of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This demon transcended the Core Formation realm!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case…” Jun Man harshly clenched his teeth. “Are there even opportunities?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know,” Xu Yangyi said lowly, “Based on the account of the Fellow Daoist who accidentally entered, no opportunities were discovered. However, the time he stayed was extremely short, no more than several days. The place where the Transference Formation sent him stretched out as far as the eye could see. After he saw this demon, he immediately departed. As a result, it’s unclear.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the end.” He observed everyone. “This is all from that Fellow Daoist’s statement. So, when Danxia Temple flushed out lotus petals, it wasn’t until then that I decided to test my blade here. The specifics about the area where the Transference Formation takes you is unknown. I can only say with great assurance that it’s the place that the Fellow Daoist spoke of back then, but I’m not positive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everybody’s mission to get here is finished. I want to go take a look underneath. After I return alive to the Xingtian Legion, the conditions that I promised to all of you will be done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mood was deathly silent. No one spoke. Each person’s gaze twinkled as they contemplated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, Quan Ningyue was the first to speak. “I’ve decided to go take a look, too,” she said resolutely, “After the transference… is the true secret realm. We’ve arrived at this step—I don’t have to heart to just leave like this. Among Qi Condensation cultivators, Foundation Establishment seniors, and even Core Formation ancestors, nobody knows what’s underneath. Since I’ve already arrived at the door, there’s no reason not to look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll naturally go wherever Master goes,” Li Zongyuan declared his position and resolved his heart. In any case, if Xu Yangyi died he would die as well. He was better off entering together. Good or bad… wouldn’t he be able to see what this deadland throughout the ages was like before dying?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t think you can get rid of me!” Mao Ba’er stuck out his tongue. “There’s definitely a great treasury down there! And you want to hog such a great destiny all to yourself?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Peony was about to open her mouth, Xu Yangyi shook his head. “You don’t have to go. If something happens to me, only you know how to assign my remnants. If someone must stay with the Xingtian Legion, it’s you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peony still wanted to say something, but Xu Yangyi’s brows furrowed. A streak of qi delivered her onto a hawk-puppet, and the puppet flew down. But the more important reason was… that she was too weak. She didn’t have any defensive power, and even Xu Yangyi himself who was entering found it difficult to ensure his own protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Declare your standings.” Xu Yangyi’s gaze brushed over every person. “If you’re willing to go, come with me. However, it’s likely you’ll lose your life. If you’re not, head back first to the Xingtian Legion and recuperate. Wait for us to return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One by one, people silently stood at Xu Yangyi’s side. All of them were legionnaires of the Xingtian Legion. Fang Cheng was the first to walk over and stand. Afterwards, it was Yao Xintan and Zhan Twelve. Gritting his teeth, Zhao Wuye also stood out and walked over. Presently, only Mo Yeyu, Qin Xueluan, Jun Man, and Zhao Fenglai remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have you gone insane…” Zhao Fenglai locked his eyes fixedly on Zhao Wuye, his gaze incomparably complex. In his eyes, there was admiration, impulse, but even more fear. “The area behind this wall is Danxia Temple! Danxia Temple’s central region!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know!” Zhao Wuye was drenched in sweat as if he was making a decision between life and death. His face was somewhat warped. “But… if I don’t go after having come here… how can I find peace?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Fenglai’s eyes reddened. After ages, he firmly grinded his teeth. “You’ve really gone insane…” He cupped his hands towards Xu Yangyi. “In that case… we’ll take our leave from this point on… Fellow Daoist Xu, I sincerely admire you. At the same time… I also hope you come out alive…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll bear your lucky words.” Xu Yangyi was like an old well without ripples. Smiling, he faced Zhao Fenglai and cupped his hands. “Have a safe journey. Be careful, everyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Fenglai nodded and said nothing. He sat on the hawk-puppet and flew down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander.” Jun Man took the initiative to speak, “Being fearless isn’t ignorance of what’s at stake. I can’t go this place. At the same time, I want to urge you not to go too, Commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks,” Xu Yangyi sighed. “I don’t want to go, either. It’s just that I have a reason that I&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">must</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Yeyu pursed his lips. Even if you lose your life?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi staunchly answered, “If I don’t go, the consequences will be even more terrifying than losing my life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Animus Armament… Its true secret and what it wanted to tell him was down below! He HAD to go. He couldn’t turn back once he cultivated this path. In the same vein, it was moreover impossible… to cultivate something that he didn’t even clearly understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Starting from moments ago… the Animus Armament… was already making a kind of snarling noise. In his head, it reverberated boundlessly! From inside it, he heard excitement, expectation, hunger and thirst, and moreover… a hatred that crossed over a millennium!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Yeyu sighed deeply. “In that case, take care of yourself, Commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks.” Xu Yangyi looked towards Qin Xueluan. “Fellow Daoist Qin, you’re not intending on continuing, as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Qin Xueluan shook her head. “Since I entered the cave… my Blue-Eyes Heavenpede has already warned me over ten times. If I go in, I might end up digging myself an early grave. I’m in favor of Fellow Daoist Jun’s words. Being fearless isn’t ignorance of what’s at stake.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Xu Yangyi swiped the storage ring on his finger, and the box with the Rootless Nine Bends Aqua fell into his hand. He passed it over. “Put it away and wait for us to return.” Pausing, he supplemented, “If we still haven’t returned in five years, the Xingtian Legion is disbanded. Leave a portion of this item to compensate the Fellow Daoists who died in battle. All of you can do as you see fit with everything else.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi spoke gently, not like he was leaving on a life-death journey in any respect. Fang Cheng shot him a brief look. “Junior Brother, you’re pretty relaxed. You ain’t kidding, are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve known this since the beginning. I’ve mentally prepared myself. Of course, I’m a lot more relaxed than everybody else.” Xu Yangyi laughed and took a deep breath afterwards. “Everybody! Move out! Let’s go… tear open Danxia Temple’s final veil!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their silhouettes gradually disappeared into the cavern’s darkness. Following their silhouettes with her eyes, Qin Xueluan sighed deeply after a good while. “I admire them a lot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah…” Mo Yeyu said, touched with deep emotion. “But… this place is too dangerous. And the opportunities are unclear, I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t talk.” Jun Man’s gaze wavered. “Right now… we have to take care of the Xingtian Legion and wait for Commander and the others to return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yangyi and the rest were none the wiser to these words. This was because they had already walked to the cave’s very bottom. There inside… was a Transference Formation flickering with light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody spoke. To go in here was to enter Danxia Temple’s ultimate chapter. No one knew what things were waiting for them there. Furthermore, no one knew about what opportunities were there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A heart vacantly unknown, searching about, and uniquely pure and innocent like a newborn babe, seeking nothing more than the Dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everybody.” Xu Yangyi took a deep breath. As he opened his eyes, the last smidgen of reverence disappeared from his eyes and was replaced with an incredible battle intent. “I’ll take the first step.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice yet to fall, he trod into the Transference Formation. A green light sparked, and his entire person vanished into thin air. Each remaining person took a few deep breaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The junior brother went in, so what the heck is the senior brother still waiting for?” Fang Cheng chuckled merrily. “I’m gonna go ahead too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After him, Yao Xintan and Zhan Twelve stepped in. Everyone else then followed. The opportunity was a mystery, yet such curiosity and mentality to explore towards Danxia Temple, one of the Eight Great Deadlands, allowed them to take this step of surmounting themselves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This step was merely an insignificant step. A step into the Transference Formation. However, it caused their Dao hearts at this moment to be incomparably firm! Completely lacking in tears or gaps!</span></p>
