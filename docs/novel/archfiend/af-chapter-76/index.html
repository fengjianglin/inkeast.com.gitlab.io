After he waited no less than half an hour, not a trace of a voice rang out. He then opened his eyes.</span></p>

His surroundings were dense with characters. If a modern pill elixirist saw this, they would’ve most certainly madly fell to their knees, prostrating these ancient marvels.</span></p>

Absent of a second word, he opened the door, and with strength coursing through his fingertips, six large characters shockingly appeared on the stone door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Trespassers will be killed without pardon!</span></p>

The jaws of the three people outside fell to the ground as they watched this scene.&nbsp;</span></p>

Regarding the large characters on the door, he said in confusion, “Is he crazy…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the cultivation room, Xu Yangyi cautiously looked at the front of the large cauldron, listening to the magnificent voice expound this most fundamental arcane effort word for word.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fire Manipulation Art, the Wind Brandishes Traces.&nbsp;</span></p>

Any cultivator could make a fireball out of thin air. This was the most common flame that the most ordinary cultivator used at the beginning of alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His spiritual sense was like threads of silk, stretching out all around. Circulating the arcane effort, he quickly felt the direction of the wind flow. It was different from a normal flow. He could even feel the rushing movement of air currents inside the windless cultivation room as they neared his body, forming unseen vortexes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My neurons have definitely been unleashed…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He inwardly thought to himself in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After I killed that berserker back then, I already became used to that sensation which was like looking at a new world. For example…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

But after that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He silently clenched his fist. It was now that he discovered that this already-familiar feeling granted him many advantages! For instance, in shadowy surroundings, it was equal to him having many more countless sets of eyes vigilant for him from sneak attacks in the dark.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now…” He inhaled deeply and suddenly revolved the arcane effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wind brandishes traces, the blowing snow cleaves the bridge, and the clouds perch upon pine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an instant, he distinctly felt the surrounding wind move. As if he had become a magnet, at this moment the surrounding air was completely drawn to him like metal! His all-encompassing spiritual sense “feelers” were like invisible helpers, manipulating the surrounding wind. The slivers poured into the furnace fire within the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Simultaneously, his right hand gently waved, and a scarlet flame crackled and ignited inside the cauldron. Xu Yangyi’s gaze was calm as usual, carefully watching the skip of each flame. The Wind Brandishes Traces was required to attain the most fundamental alchemy requirement, to make the flames within a six hour period not decrease and moreover not increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the way of alchemy, fire intensity was the whole cornerstone of pill refining. When the fire was great and when the fire was small. If these matters were incorrect at a single step, the requirements would not be met. Precious heavenly treasures could only be completely squandered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Wind Brandishes Traces, as the name implied, was to take all wind traces and draw them into the blaze via the spiritual sense. This was the Fire Manipulation Art. Xu Yangyi carefully manipulated the trajectory of each wind trace, prudently pushing them towards the flame. However...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flame pulsed about rather obviously. This was evidently an unfamiliar omen. He didn’t care; in any case, it was impossible to ascend to the heavens in a single bound. At the same time he controlled the wind power, he was performing the first counting, to see how long he was able to persevere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the scripture explanation just now, he already understood that in ancient alchemy, a Qi Condensation medicinal pill would take around fifteen days, a Foundation Establishment one at least two months. For Core Formation, a year was standard. As for beyond… there wasn’t any record.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was to also say that he presently had to maintain at least twenty-five days worth of energy. Only then he could consider starting the next step. This was because he was unclear whether these fifteen days were talking about a skilled pill disciple or a novice like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One hour, two hours… three hours passed. The flame before him swooshed and was thoroughly extinguished. As for he himself, his back was already drenched with cold sweat. He stood up and took a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s even more difficult than I imagined.” He narrowed his eyes, looking at the suddenly darkened cultivation room. This time’s failure was within his forecast. Not only was he not a bit dispirited, there was an even more fiery expectation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an alchemy technique. An alchemy technique lost to the world for a century! So long as he brought forth a pill, the entire cultivation would go mad for it! Pill elixirs and capsules, both were simply incapable of preventing the problem of medicinal volatility, options of last resort!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Proceed!” He gaze flashed. Without any idea of rest, he rather threw himself again into training the Fire Manipulation Art’s Wind Brandishes Traces straightaway.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, in the Eternal Alchemy Canon, alchemy was cultivation. His great hatred was still unavenged, and he couldn’t even discover a shadow of his hated foe. His promise to Firecloud was also uncompleted, and there was also Su Lianyue’s promise back then. If he even considered stopping, he would be unable to make it through this seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day went by, two days passed… a month… two months… half a year...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from coming outside to eat everyday, Xu Yangyi seemed to live in the stone room, seeing no one at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he crazy?” The weather had already changed to spring’s end, and all things were flourishing with vitality. Not to mention Li Zongyuan, even the three cultivators were unable to contain their nervousness. This was because the time that Xu Yangyi left seclusion was becoming longer and longer. There were too many times that he actually required the aid of Fasting Pill Elixir.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore… each time he left seclusion, while his mental state was well, the condition of his entire person was awfully poor!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even now, his hair had transformed from short locks to a shawl that trailed over his shoulders. Xu Yangyi disliked this inconvenience, so he’d tied his hair into a braid. If he was also wearing a narrow-sleeved changpao of the olden days, he would be like a living incarnation of an ancient cultivator in the modern world.&nbsp;</span></p>

In a flash, he seemed yet not to smell. Each time he left seclusion, he would finish eating and bathe, using a Cleansing Talisman to wash, and then enter the cultivation room once more.</span></p>

In this half year, his capital had long since been wiped out clean. Fortunately, the market demand for Dew Congealing Grass was great, capable of supporting them. Otherwise, even the wages of the three helpers couldn’t be paid.</span></p>

We had originally planned to make a quick buck in your place. But at most, once another two years go by, we’ll have no choice but to bid farewell.”</span></p>

If Fellow Daoist Xu is in seclusion for three to five years, isn’t that the same as us waiting on him for three to five years?” Wang Chunlai said somewhat reluctantly, “I also haven’t cultivated in more than half a year… In the struggle of all things, without advance, there can only be retreat. Fellow Daoist Li, after this month’s bill is settled, I’m going to have to take a temporary leave.”</span></p>

Even his eyes seemed to be faintly reddened. Anyone who looked at fire for many years was like this. Under this contrast, though, he appeared to be fairly incongruous. The word “terrible” could be completely used to describe him.</span></p>

There wasn’t the single trace of a dispirited aura on him as well. Similar to untamed grass in the wilderness, his spirit was blooming.</span></p>

He faced towards everyone and nodded, heading back into the cultivation room again. Cultivation was like this. After the eyes closed, azure seas would transform into mulberry fields. Perhaps it wasn’t a loneliness of the body, but rather a loneliness of the spirit. Any cultivator understood that only by enduring the loneliness could the long ages be guarded against.</span></p>

As the eyes opened, it was already 2026. Such a situation was far, far too many in number. The simultaneous sorrow of the whiteness of clouds turning to the grayness of dogs and the vicissitudes of current trends realized an even more formidable power within the body. It was thereupon in this feeling was how one supposed to know of a fish’s delight if you weren’t a fish? <span id="footnote-ref-5551"><a href="#footnote-5551">[1]</a></span></span></p>
