 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two men were hired grunts by Hans, and they were local hoodlums. They came after hearing that they could get ten red bills by beating someone up. But when they arrived, they were further shocked since they never expected that they would be brought into a secret chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What did that mean? That meant that they could be unbridled, and they wouldn’t be held responsible even if life was affected. Thus, they brandished their rods without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rods ferociously swung over. If they hit the head, it would practically cause a concussion, and the two of them were truly ruthless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the two of them with his brows locked, Su Tao sighed and felt a little disappointed that these two would be bribed by a foreigner to lay hands on their own fellow comrades. He felt utterly disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So how could he allow them to achieve what they wish? Although he was cuffed, dealing with two hoodlums wasn’t a problem for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first hoodlum was caught by surprise and felt a heavy blow to his chin then instantly fainted. When the other person felt that there was something amiss, he suffered a blow to his abdomen just when he wanted to retreat. After that, he was struck with a roundhouse kick to his face and fainted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Su Tao started learning martial arts from Yan Wujin, he was getting more skillful at utilising the Qi concealed in his acupoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that these two were being made use of, so he only gave them a little punishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A brief moment later, the chamber was opened. When Xuan Wangjun’s subordinate saw the two fainted hoodlums, he was startled. He immediately retreated from the chamber and locked the door before reporting this to his superior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at this scene, Su Tao helplessly sighed. It seemed like his restraints would be further upgraded now, and it wouldn’t just be handcuffing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door was suddenly opened again with a knife and pointed at him. “Don’t move and raise your hands!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao obediently raised his hands, someone charged over and restrained him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling pain in his lower abdomen, Su Tao muttered out a groan. These people had treated him like an uncooperative person in custody, and they had even used dirty tricks in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boss, I’m afraid that we won’t be able to hold him here.” One of the subordinates suggested, “Why don’t we send him to the third prison? It will be much safer there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Xuan Wangjun looked at his subordinate with a complicated gaze. “Alright. Make some contacts and send him to the third prison!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao wasn’t resisting, the subordinate first got someone to carry the two hoodlums out before giving the third prison a call. The third prison in Sichuan Province was the nearest prison from Baitan Town, and there were many career criminals being kept there. The security there was also ranked amongst the best in the country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, a bullet-proof escort vehicle arrived. Prison officers armed to the teeth came down as they escorted Su Tao out from the secret chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not far away, Hans sat in an off-road vehicle and snapped the cap of a cigar, then lit it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation was progressing as he had planned, and this was only just the first step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the vehicle left, Hans made a call and asked, “Are all the arrangements made?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sinister snicker resounded from the other side, “Boss, as long as the money is in place, those people inside are willing to do anything, not to mention messing with a guy. Even taking his life is not an issue.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the vehicle, Su Tao had a gun pointed against his waist. He never imagined that he would be treated like a criminal one day and would be escorted to prison. Although he would occasionally act without morals and be cheap, he was generally a responsible and good citizen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, his mood wasn’t so pessimistic that he had a clear conscious. With so many people paying attention to him, getting released was just a matter of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he felt that this was also an extraordinary experience. When he becomes successful in the future and intends to write his own book, he could include this story in it. A famous physician was once framed and sent to prison. Just how exciting would that be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more unfavorable the situation developed, the calmer he felt. If the matter didn’t blow up, it wouldn’t be easy to deal with an enemy like Hans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his view, Hans might seem smart, but he was actually digging his own grave. Then again, he was the one in a terrible situation, while Hans was the winner for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most depressing fact was that when he was held in the chamber earlier, he suffered the dirty tricks from Xuan Wangjun’s subordinates. Although he didn’t suffer any injuries, he felt a chill in his heart from disappointment in the current society.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he knew that the reason why he was treated in this matter was his identity as an outsider. If it was in Hanzhou City, it’s impossible for something like this to occur to him. Furthermore, it was Hans, and another force in the town manipulating this situation, and even darker things awaited him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third prison in Sichuan Province was located in Chenhe City, which was thirty kilometers away. When they arrived at the prison, it was already 10 p.m., and there wasn’t anyone around. There was a towering cement wall covered in electrical barbs and a black iron gate that reflected the moon’s radiance. It was akin to the mouth of a whale with a smaller door to the side for prison personnel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the light shone on him, Su Tao subconsciously looked up. There was an armed officer in the watchtower. In reality, escaping from prison was practically impossible. Aside from armed patrol officers, some hounds added layers to the defense as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a simple hand over procedure, Su Tao was taken away by a prison officer in his twenties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the height of that officer was roughly 5’5”, he had a robust built. As he walked, his shoulders would fearlessly sway like crabs, since this was his territory. Regardless of anyone’s identity, they were required to display absolute obedience towards prison officers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao followed the prison officer through the long hallway, there was only dim light that lit the path. It was a comprehensive system in the prison. The prisoners were mostly asleep at this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking to the end of the hallway, the prison officer opened a cell door. When Su Tao looked inside, it was a huge dormitory that looked like the hall of a bathhouse with a group of people in it. Even though many people heard the commotion, no one dared to raise their heads. After all, this was a prison, and they’re familiar with the rules here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a prison officer to send someone at this timing, it must be a newcomer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pointing at an empty bed, the officer said, “This is yours!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A person behind gave a shove and Su Tao staggered two steps forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before the prison officer left, he drew out his baton and knocked it on the bed before him before shutting the metal gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a foul stench in the prison cell. After Su Tao laid down on it, the prisoners started to bounce up after that officer had gone far away. These people all looked lively, since none of them looked sleepy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man, who had his bed knocked by that prison officer came over and asked, “Hey, newcomer. What’s your name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao!” Su Tao frankly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you do?” That middle-aged man rubbed on his bald head as he asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was framed!” Su Tao was good-looking and seemed to be an inexperienced young man in his twenties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck, how many of us here aren’t framed?” The bald man cussed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a veteran here, and when that officer knocked his bed three times, it meant that he was to mess with the newcomer as long as life wasn’t threatened. The bald man had a nickname, Black Leather. He’s one of the underworld bosses in the third prison. He was initially sentenced to death for murder, but it was changed to life imprisonment due to a contribution. Recently, it was reduced to thirty years, and the reason why his sentence was reduced was due to his good relations with the officers here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This cell was meant for violent criminals, and it was common for newcomers to be brought here and taught a lesson by Black Leather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that reminder by that prison officer wasn’t common. It meant that this brat had offended someone outside, and he had to be given ‘special’ treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boss Black Leather, this brat looks pretty tender. Why don’t you let me have some fun with him?” A skinny man chuckled as he came over.</span></p>

He suddenly felt that his prison days would be more entertaining with a newcomer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pointing towards two other men, the skinny man grinned. “Hold him!” When he finished, he walked towards Su Tao, intending to remove Su Tao’s pants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing his words, Su Tao wanted to swear, since he would feel disgusted for life if this person touched him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Su Tao walked towards the gate and screamed, “Are there any officers? Help! Someone’s beating me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were generally three forms of address to call a prison officer in prison, instructor, officer, and sir. When Su Tao called with the second form, he indirectly meant that he wasn’t unfamiliar with prisons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black Leather was instantly dumbfounded while looking at Su Tao.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s this brat doing?

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Su Tao had expected, his response was silence.</span></p>

Suddenly, Black Leather felt his legs trembling and felt something was amiss.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young man was acting!</span></p>
