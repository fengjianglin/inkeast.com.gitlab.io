 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao was categorised as a rebellious, spoiled brat who did things without any consideration for the consequences. Even Su Tao felt his scalps going numb for getting himself involved with this lass, since troubles would undoubtedly follow. But since a grudge has already formed, Su Tao wasn’t too worried. After all, he was the benefactor of the Cao Family, and even if Cao Jiaojiao was unruly, she would definitely reconsider when provoking him again after receiving those resounding slaps from her father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he returned to the ward, Cao Dingjun was extremely cooperative. The old man finished the bowl of soup under Su Tao’s instruction. When he took the old man’s pulse, he noticed that there were significant improvements after drinking the Mind Revitalising Soup. After making adjustments with the herbs, the effect went as he expected. However, the impact of the Cloud Grass wasn’t at the optimal, since he was slightly delayed during the last procedure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was still within Su Tao’s range of expectations, and if he made alterations for the second portion, he might even be able to leave Minnan Province ahead of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Shui Junzhuo would be returning to Beijing, Su Tao explained the matter to Cao Dingjun and Cao Huaiqing before sending the former off to the airport.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao left, Cao Dingjun furrowed his brows together. “What’s wrong with Little Su’s hand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sight, Cao Huaiqing knew that his father’s condition has improved to be even able to notice such a small detail. “He was accidentally scalded when he was brewing the medicine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m afraid that the matter isn’t that simple, right?” Cao Dingjun’s brows remained locked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s Jiaojiao again!” At this moment, Cao Huaiqing could only come clean with his father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Cao Dingjun weakly replied, “Jiaojiao is too immature. She’s the complete opposite of Shui Junzhuo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Cao Huaiqing inquired, “Dad, I have a method, and I would like to ask you about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?” Cao Dingjun looked at his son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to build up Jiaojiao’s independence. With her character, I’m afraid that she might suffer in the future if she’s not restrained.” Cao Huaiqing was afraid that his father might not agree to it. After all, Cao Jiaojiao’s temper had a lot to do with his father’s pampering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh…” After experiencing the illness, Cao Dingjun’s mindset has changed. “You’re right. I initially thought that since Jiaojiao was a girl, there’s nothing wrong with pampering her a little more. But death will come for us sooner or later, and I’m afraid that Jiaojiao will suffer from her temperament if the Cao Family, or I, is gone. You’re a father, and you’re responsible for teaching her. Regardless of your decision, I will support you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Receiving his father’s agreement, Cao Huaiqing moved closer to the old man’s ear and whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the old man was filled with reluctance, he still nodded his head with his teeth gnashed and agreed to his son’s decision.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Cao Jiaojiao’s mood hit rock bottom. Barging through red lights along the way, she came to the pub that she and her friends frequented. She wore a fiery fur coat, making her look akin to a fireball as she entered the pub. Knocking her knuckles on the bar, she ordered, “Two Killers!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Jiaojiao, Killer is the most intense alcohol here, and I’m afraid that you’ll be drunk from a glass.” The bartender warned. The bartender was young, but he was actually three to four years older than Cao Jiaojiao. However, Cao Jiaojiao was famous, and anyone from the underworld and officials had to give her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cut your crap. I want my alcohol, now!” Cao Jiaojiao slammed her purse on the bar and continued, “Otherwise, you can close up your pub!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a big tone!” A youth who looked to be in his twenties walked over before signalling the bartender with his eye for the latter to mix the cocktail. “So it’s Big Sister Jiaojiao. Well, it’s not arrogance if it’s coming from you. Now, I’m curious. Who dares to offend the princess of Minnan Province?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rui Han, cut your nonsense. You just so happen to show up when I’m lacking someone to kill time with. Come, drink a few glasses with me!” Cao Jiaojiao waved her hand and arrogantly gave an order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rui Han was a man with bewitching looks; he looked like a woman instead. His eyes were inclined upwards with a sharp chin. His hair wasn’t long, and was dyed dark-blonde. He wore a fashionable, casual suit and polished shoes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t annoyed with being ordered by Cao Jiaojiao. At this moment, the bartender served up two glasses of Killer, one for each of them. But just when Cao Jiaojiao was about to gulp it down, she was stopped by Rui Han. “Big Sister Jiaojiao, I know that you have a good capacity for alcohol, but even you won’t be spared from the effects of this drink.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I’m calling you to drink, then drink. Otherwise, you can get lost!” Cao Jiaojiao had a fiery temper as she raised her head and gulped down the alcohol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Rui Han took a sip. He was a rational person, and he did not get over his head to finish the entire glass. When he saw that Cao Jiaojiao was still in the mood for more drinks, he waved his hand towards the bartender for an ordinary drink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Killer was a famous cocktail for its intensity. It was mixed with one shot of vodka, one shot of gin, one shot of rum, and three shots of Bacardi. The alcohol content in this drink alone was at 70%, and any ordinary person would be drunk with one glass in the stomach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Cao Jiaojiao took a sip of the drink, she instantly felt that something was wrong and raged at Rui Han. The latter was helpless against her anger and gave in, ordering the bartender for another Killer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Jiaojiao, why don’t you tell me who has offended you? I’ll take revenge for you!” Rui Han showed a gentlemanly smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You?” Cao Jiaojiao looked at the glass in Rui Han’s hand and mocked, “You’re a man that doesn’t even dare to drink Killer, so how do you want me to believe you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rui Han had the intention to pursue Cao Jiaojiao, and he has been watching her from the sidelines for a long time now. Hence, he felt that it was an excellent opportunity for him to get close to Cao Jiaojiao, since the latter was in a terrible mood today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, so if I finish this entire glass, you’ll have to tell me who offended you!” Rui Han glanced at the glass before he gulped it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not bad. You’re like a man now!” Cao Jiaojiao stared at Rui Han for a long time before she continued, “It’s my father. You can go look for him now and take revenge for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With an awkward smile, Rui Han smiled. “Big Sister Jiaojiao, you really do know how to joke!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t give out blind promises if you’re useless!” Cao Jiaojiao knew the meaning in Rui Han’s words, which she swept a glance of disdain on his face and slammed a few bills on the bar before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Rui Han wanted to go after her, he felt his legs going weak, since the Killer was too powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching this scene, Cao Jiaojiao teased. Rui Han was living a pipe dream by wanting to pursue her. When he wasn’t paying attention earlier, she added something ‘special’ in his drink, which Rui Han was too careless to fall for it. The quantity that she doped him with could leave him in bed for two to three days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Cao Jiaojiao was young, she wasn’t an innocent girl. She knew how to differentiate between genuine friends and those that were merely trying to get close to her because of her family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rui Han was a famous playboy in Minnan Province, who has been relying on his pretty face to fool those around him. There were even rumours that the shares for this pub were something given to him by a wealthy woman, and this sort of scum was merely tired of living to try and have ill intentions for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She initially wanted to get drunk, but it was all ruined by Rui Han. She felt her emotions being pent up when her phone suddenly lit up. Picking up the call, she asked, “How is it? Did you manage to find the address?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I found it! Su Tao is living at the Skytrump Hotel, the five-starred hotel closest to the hospital.” A reply came from the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I got it. Thanks!” Cao Jiaojiao hung up the call. She did not hate her father for those slaps, but Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when she wanted to drive to the hotel, the effect of the drink started to kick in, leaving her dizzy. Thus, she hailed a cab and headed to the hotel that Su Tao was staying in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You had someone to help you today in the hospital, but there’s no one to help you in the hotel!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Cao Jiaojiao inwardly raged.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were plots in dramas where the male lead would charge in when the female lead was about to leave and begged her not to go. In which, the female lead would be touched and accepted the male lead’s request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But for anyone with common sense, they would know that you’re required to wait in the boarding area to board your plane, and you would not be allowed entry if you did not have the same boarding ticket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So those plots in dramas were all fabricated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Su Tao was stopped at the ticketing station as he watched Shui Junzhuo being manually checked with a metal detector. When she was done with the check, she turned around and smiled at Su Tao before turning around the corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The relationship between them has grown deeper through their interactions for the past few days. It was pure memories that lingered in Su Tao’s mind, and even the demon in his heart hid when facing Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao returned to the hotel, he started attending to his wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Scalding wounds were common, and the Scald Burn Ointment left behind by his grandfather, Su Guangsheng, was extremely effective. It would undoubtedly receive the acknowledgement of the market if it was mass-produced. After applying the ointment on the injury, Su Tao soon felt a cooling sensation spreading out. But Su Tao was never pampered as he had tasted all sorts of pain since young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tested medicine with his own body, just like how the Farmer God tested herbs on himself to find the worth in those herbs, which Su Tao found himself to be in the same position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, the doorbell rang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Locking his brows together, Su Tao went to open the door. He wasn’t surprised by the visitor. The princess of the Cao Family came haunting him again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Cao Jiaojiao wasn’t here to woo him, since there was disdain in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had never seen such hatred in the eyes of a woman who was looking at him. After all, he was blessed in his looks and inner qualities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can I help you?” Su Tao asked as he pressed against the door with the uninjured hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing much, I only want to chat with you. You saved my grandpa, and you’re the benefactor of my family. After understanding the entire matter, I would like to apologise to you for hurting you.” The change in Cao Jiaojiao’s expression was swift, and if it wasn’t for Su Tao’s keen sight, he might have been fooled by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need, I have nothing to say to you!” Just when Su Tao was about to close the door, Cao Jiaojiao suddenly stretched her arm through the crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his brows locked together, Su Tao was starting to get annoyed with this lass and continued to close the door, which Cao Jiaojiao yelled in pain.</span></p>
