 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming laid on his bed with a cigarette between his fingers as he smoked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gorgeous woman walked out of the shower and dried her hair. When she saw that Qin Ming was stripped to his briefs and saw he had no muscle and even had a belly, she sourly smiled. “Why aren’t you wearing anything? It’s easy for you to catch a cold.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming chuckled as he dragged the woman over and smiled. “I’ve already gotten impatient from waiting for you to shower. Why would I need to wear clothes when I’m waiting for you to extinguish my fire?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman placed her finger on Qin Ming’s lips and unhappily said, “Don’t be in such a rush. You’ve not accomplished what you promised me from before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you killing the mood to be talking about that at this moment?” Qin Ming locked his brows unhappily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t resolve this matter, then we will be exposed by that wretch, He Xiaoyu, sooner or later. Aren’t you afraid of your reputation being ruined?” The woman pushed Qin Ming to the side since pillow talk had to be conducted at this moment for it to be effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her name was Miao Xinling, a nurse in the Jianghuai Hospital as well. However, she was different from He Xiaoyu, she relied on her connections to join the hospital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to her decent family and how she groomed herself, she was a dazzling existence amongst the nurses and even attracted Qin Ming’s attention. His wife had just given birth, and she’s still recuperating. So Qin Ming couldn’t vent his lust; on the other hand, Miao Xinling admired the young and mature Qin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, a spark naturally flew between them as they interacted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were generally cautious and would maintain their distance in the hospital. But there was one time when they were working overtime and behaved intimately by the garden; it was chanced upon by He Xiaoyu. Due to this matter, Qin Ming even gave He Xiaoyu a warning personally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Qin Ming helplessly said, “He Xiaoyu is just a nurse who has joined the hospital for two years, and she will keep her mouth shut since I’ve already warned her about this matter. Are you trying to chase her away because of the pressure that she’s giving you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, she’s too eager to win and would take the initiative to do any labour. Although she joined during the same year as me, she has already been promoted to the VIP ward. Truth be told, I can’t stand the sight of her.” Miao Xinling snorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pinching Miao Xinling cheeks, Qin Ming smiled. “Your father is an official in the country, and your mother is a successful businesswoman, while you’re so charming yourself. Why bother with a poor commoner like her? The VIP ward is extremely important and requires capable nurses, and someone like He Xiaoyu is necessary for the development and operation of the hospital. As for you, isn’t it easy and carefree for you to take roll call and other stuff?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glaring at Qin Ming, Miao Xinling raged, “Have you fallen for that wretch?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming was briefly stunned by her abrupt accusation and smiled. “Don’t worry about her. I might be playful, but I’m not a garbage collector. The women that I take a fancy to are required to have a temperament like yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re so bad, and you only know how to lie!” Miao Xinling evidently felt better from Qin Ming’s coaxing, since she took a few steps forth and hooked onto the latter’s neck. “The two of us might be friends with benefits, but we have a common enemy. I also do not wish for this matter to be revealed since I still want to marry in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grabbing onto Miao Xinling by the waist, a naughty smile rose on Qin Ming’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He liked the outlook of life Miao Xinling had since the latter knew that they wouldn’t be together for a long time, and she didn’t force him to divorce and take responsibility for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A woman like Miao Xinling only enjoyed the excitement of being together with a married man. When she’s at the right age, then she would probably change her appearance into a virtuous woman and get married.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming felt relaxed while being together with her because he knew that she wouldn’t affect his life. The two of them have hit off as kindred spirits, and once they get tired of it, then they would maintain a distance with each other. Then again, it was worth considering if there’s anything he could do for her in this period.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Vice-President Qin, you have to promise me that you’ll chase that wretch away!” Miao Xinling was stubborn on this matter since she knew that she had to grasp this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vexed by her pestering, Qin Ming promised, “Don’t worry about it, I have already made an arrangement, and if it all goes according to my plan, I will be able to hit two birds with one stone. Aside from making He Xiaoyu leave, I can also ruin Su Tao’s reputation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving Qin Ming’s promise, Miao Xinling smiled. “I’ll go patch up my makeup.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go on!” Qin Ming also felt that Miao Xinling was more charming with makeup on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the display of his phone lit up with a ringtone; it was a call from his wife.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Qin Ming and Miao Xinling were spending their adultery time together in the room, a man entered the hotel with a baseball cap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mister, would you like to stay?” The front desk passionately asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, I have a friend who stays here in this hotel, and I would like to have a room beside his.” The man smiled as he took out his identity card</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“May I ask the number of the room that your friend is staying in?” The front desk asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He didn’t give it to me.” The man awkwardly smiled before he suggested, “How about this, I’ll give him a call!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, he pretended to make a call, but after a few attempts, he wryly smiled. “No one’s picking up the phone. How about this, help me look for someone by the name of Qin Ming.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the front desk hesitated, she was ultimately convinced by the man’s acting skills. “Mr. Qin Ming is staying in Room 8028!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man with the baseball cap was Xia Yu. Although he managed to find Qin Ming’s location, he did not know the exact room number. Hence, he resorted to this play.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The front desk was just a young lady, and she was easily fooled by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll take Room 8030. I have something that I would like to discuss with him, after which I will leave roughly two hours from now.” Xia Yu pondered and felt the need to save money, since it wouldn’t take long for him to deal with Qin Ming while pushing his identity card over.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon entering Room 8030, Xia Yu lowered his cap as he came to the window and tried the screen window before he proficiently dismantled it and took out a high-definition camera from his bag before he leaped and stood on the window ledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As an experienced private investigator, he knew how to swiftly invade other people’s private territory by relying on his flexibility and coordination. A few seconds later, he was already outside the window ledge of the room next door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he swiftly dismantled the screen window, he slowly opened the window without making any noise. At this moment, he could hear a man and woman talking in the room, but Xia Yu has already passed the age to eavesdropping. On the other hand, he was analysing the right time to enter to obtain the best effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he slowly left the curtain, he stared at the adultering couple for two to three minutes. The two of them really knew how to dawdle before he barked and started to click his camera.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming and Miao Xinling were both startled by the sudden invader. They have come to this hotel numerous times, and they’re already familiar with the place here. Hence, they did not have their guard up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xia Yu seemed to have descended from the sky, since he did not come through the door but the window instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you?!” Qin Ming got down from the bed in a panic as he covered his body with the quilt. “You’re committing a crime!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I’m committing a crime. But what about you? I don’t think you’re in the right position to say that, right?” Xia Yu said as he raised his camera and snapped two photos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My wife sent you over?” Qin Ming probed. His first reaction was that this man seems to be a private investigator, and he might be someone sent over by his wife to find dirt on him. “You’ve obtained the evidence through illegal means, so it’s useless in court!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu was briefly stunned before he sighed. Qin Ming was truly cunning and selfish since he even tried to haggle at this time. Hence, Xia Yu patiently explained, “Firstly, I don’t know your wife. Then again, I don’t mind sending the photos to her, either. Secondly, there’s no need for me to hide my identity. Since you dared to plot against others, it’s natural that others can also do the same to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Xia Yu with a complicated glance, Qin Ming suddenly figured it out and asked, “Su Tao sent you here?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xia Yu did not straightforwardly reply, but swept a glance at the trembling Miao Xinling. “At least you’re not stupid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Despicable fellow!” Qin Ming cursed. “To use such an underhanded tactic against me, I’ll curse all of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words left Xia Yu briefly stunned before he chuckled, “Aren’t you a joke? Only you’re allowed to use tactics, and you won’t allow others to do the same to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gnashing his teeth, Qin Ming challenged, “Don’t get too happy yet. If anything happens to me, Su Tao won’t be able to escape as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrugging his shoulders, Xia Yu weakly sighed, “I initially only intended to take a few photos before leaving. However, I never expected that your mouth would be so cheap. It seems like not even the heavens will forgive me for letting you off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking over, he dragged Qin Ming by his hair and raised his knee at the latter’s abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming felt an intense pain in his abdomen and held onto his stomach as he fell to the ground onto his knees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the side, Miao Xinling was terrified and was trembling while she hid under the quilt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was terrified by Xia Yu since she had no idea if this man would harm her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her relationship with Qin Ming isn’t love, the latter was just her comfort partner. Hence, she did not want to put her life at risk for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The selfishness of humanity was revealed at this moment as the adultering couple was pondering how they could get away with this matter while letting the other party be a scapegoat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Xia Yu walked over to Miao Xinling, but he was stunned after smelling the stench of urine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a soft heart when it came to women, and he was here for Qin Ming. He never intended to make things difficult for Qin Ming’s friend with benefits, to begin with, so why did she pee herself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t hurt me!” Miao Xinling was trembling as she begged. “I can give you money, as much as you want!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu helplessly sighed before he raised his hand and gave her a slap, which instantly left her stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although your acting skills are good, this slap of mine is for Qin Ming’s wife. Even if you’re pitiful, can you be more pitiful than a woman who’s in her breastfeeding period?”</span></p>
