 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hubby, what’s the matter?” Zhang Ailian’s body tensed up as her heart throbbed. She was trying her best to remain calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where did you put the ice skates for our son’s ice skating lesson tomorrow?” Her husband, Liu Ming, was instructed by Zhang Ailian to bring their kid to the lesson tomorrow. However, Liu Ming couldn’t find the ice skates despite searching for a long time and became impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The blade on the ice skates had turned a little blunt, so I sent them for grinding.” Zhang Ailian locked her brows together. Wang Guofeng was teasing her lower body. Her legs were trembling and she leaned against the wall while conversing with her husband through her subconscious mind. All of a sudden, she exclaimed, “Ah…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through the phone, Liu Ming felt something was amiss about his wife’s voice and curiously asked, “Wifey, what’s wrong? Why does your voice sound unusual?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I caught a little cold, and someone overturned my cup of tea! How hateful!” Zhang Ailian swiftly squeezed the words out as she covered it up and glanced at Wang Guofeng with her begging eyes. She hoped that he could let her go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Guofeng was basking in excitement at this moment. When he raised his head, he smiled towards Zhang Ailian and felt his heart tickling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Ailian knew that Wang Guofeng would only torture her even more and swiftly ended the call before turning off her phone.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Ming heard the busy tone, he knitted his brows and sighed. Ever since his wife was promoted, she has gotten busier in her work. She was initially a nurse in the province’s People’s Hospital with an annual income of about ¥100,000 with bonuses. After she got promoted, her income soared to ¥150,000 and surpassed him. That caused his authority in the family to be affected while Zhang Ailian became the decision-maker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, their 5-year-old kid ran out of his room. “Dad, I found the ice skates!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Ming received them, he examined them for a long time before asking, “Where did you find them? Didn’t your mother say that they were taken for grinding?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Under my study table!” The son smiled. “Mom fixed them yesterday!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Caressing on his son’s forehead, Liu Ming pondered what was wrong with his wife. Letting out a sigh, he felt that she was probably too busy with her work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the relationship between husband and wife. Whenever there’s something weird, they would always try to find a reason for it. They did not think of the tiny hints that state the change of heart. Liu Ming was the manager of an enterprise, and his circle was small. Hence, he did not think that his wife has already betrayed him.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the hotel, it was a moment of spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the billowing waves, Wang Guofeng and Zhang Ailian finally laid on the spacious bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, tears started to well up within Zhang Ailian’s eyes. She finally started to feel guilty about cheating on her husband.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you crying?” Wang Guofeng locked his brows together as he extinguished the cigarette and asked, “You’re not happy with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not it! I just feel… I just feel cheap!” Zhang Ailian stuttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Wang Guofeng pulled her to his side and kissed her forehead with a smile. “No, you’re always a goddess in my eyes. Don’t worry, no one will find out about us. In the eyes of your husband and son, you’re still the same as before!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Guofeng, why don’t we stop meeting after today?” Zhang Ailian weakly said before she continued, “I don’t want to bear the pressure anymore!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile of disdain, Wang Guofeng felt that only he was qualified to dump her, and not the other way around. He has spent a great deal of effort to woo her, and he definitely wouldn’t let her go since he hasn’t gotten tired of her yet. Thus, he responded, “Ailian, please believe in my feelings for you. Why don’t you divorce? I’ll marry you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way!” Zhang Ailian briefly paused before she continued, “I have a son, and I have to give him a complete family. Not to mention that I already had a marriage, and I’m not compatible with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nonsense!” Wang Guofeng caressed Zhang Ailian’s shoulder and replied, “I’m someone that pursues my true love, and I don’t care about those worldly views. As long as you’re willing to divorce, I will marry you with a grand wedding!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand your feelings for me!” Firstly, Zhang Ailian’s family wasn’t compatible; Secondly, she was uneasy about the uncertain future. “We can never be husband and wife.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, promise me. Don’t ever leave me!” Wang Guofeng continued with his sweet talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, but we can only maintain this relationship.” Zhang Ailian begged. “This way, it’s good for both of us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Guofeng sighed out in disappointment, he replied, “Alright, I’ll respect your decision. I am also willing to bear this pain. Whenever you’re not with me, I would think of you and your husband together, which leaves me in bitter pain and jealousy. No man can endure sharing his woman with another man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It goes without saying that Wang Guofeng’s acting skills touched Zhang Ailian and she lowered her voice, “I will do my best to stop him from touching me. I’m sorry!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being able to make Zhang Ailian promise that she would not let her husband touch her was his greatest success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wang Guofeng knew that he has utterly subdued Zhang Ailian. With success filling his heart, it dispelled the depression and setbacks he has suffered in his career. “You’ve had it tough!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As long as you’re happy, I’m willing to do anything!” Zhang Ailian sweetly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, help me…” Wang Guofeng changed his posture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After bashfully staring at Wang Guofeng, Zhang Ailian gently nodded her head.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mo Sui’er returned to the Three Flavour Hall, she locked herself in her room. Watching this scene, Su Tao sighed while standing in the courtyard of the dorm and brewed himself a pot of tea while he waited for an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He naturally had something prepared when he left with Mo Sun’er, it was Xia Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been making preparations for Wang Guofeng and Bai Fan. After suffering so many schemes, he has also started to set his sights on retaliating against the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Xia Yu walked in gasping for breath before he took a mouthful of the chilled tea and furrowed his brows. “That Wang Guofeng is simply a scumbag!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao waved his hand, Xia Yu handed his camera over. When Su Tao looked through it and saw Rangure, his heart sank. It was just as he had speculated. That woman had a hand in Wang Guofeng trying to entice Mo Sun’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Su Tao looking at the bewitching foreign beauty, Xia Yu pondered for a long time before he urged, “That woman is not the main focus here! Look at the next one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, a well-dolled young woman appeared and Su Tao guessed, “Wang Guofeng’s lover?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu indignantly cursed, “The moment Sun’er left the room, he immediately called two women. Bloody hell, isn’t he a scumbag?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re just jealous of him, right?” Su Tao noticed Xia Yu’s thoughts and analysed, “Wang Guofeng is a well-known doctor in the province, and he also has a good background, along with his own company. As a bachelor, it’s normal for him to have women crowding around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine if that woman was single, but Wang Guofeng seduced a married woman! He’s destroying a family, and it’s wicked beyond redemption!” Xia Yu cursed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Su Tao felt guilty before his face turned red. Wouldn’t that be the same with Lu Shimiao? However, he explained it to himself that the feelings between Lu Shimiao and her husband had already cracked, and they had already come to an end. His appearance was only a catalyst, so it was different from being a homewrecker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like you’ve already investigated that woman?” Su Tao sighed. Wang Guofeng had just confessed to Mo Sun’er and brought a lover in the next moment. That was simply too despicable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The woman is called Zhang Ailian, a nurse of the province’s People’s Hospital. When you tasked me with investigating Wang Guofeng, I noticed that the two of them had an intimate relationship. I never expected that I would catch a piece of evidence in Hanzhou City.” Xia Yu said pridefully. “Zhang Ailian has her own family, and her son is five years old. Her husband’s name is Liu Ming, and he can be considered as a white-collared worker. The couple had a good relationship until Wang Guofeng got close to her. The latter even went as far as using the pretense of work to approach her…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you intend to do?” Su Tao could tell that Xia Yu already had a plan to deal with Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are two methods. Firstly, I will hand over the investigation results to Liu Ming by post. Liu Ming will surely be enraged and look for Wang Guofeng. If the matter blew up, we could just fan the fire and ruin Wang Guofeng’s reputation; Secondly, we can send it over to Wang Guofeng to threaten him. In the future, if he dares to collude with Bai Fan to deal with the Three Flavour Hall, we will be able to use this against him!” Xia Yu said confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a wry smile, Su Tao felt that Xia Yu was too simple-minded. “Since Wang Guofeng dares to approach Zhang Ailian, then he mustn’t be afraid of the matter blowing up. As a man, although having an affair would momentarily affect his reputation, it will ultimately be accepted by society in the end. Furthermore, you understand nothing about Liu Ming. He might not blow up the matter, and he might even keep this matter a secret to protect his family from falling apart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can this be? Is there such a foolish man in the world that is willing to be a cuckold?” Xia Yu sounded his doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Men have a stronger acceptance for an affair than women. As long as this matter doesn’t affect his reputation or family, he might choose to endure it.” Su Tao analysed for a long time before he said, “Send the photos to my phone later. You continue to observe Wang Guofeng and find more favorable evidence. We can’t alert him for the time being.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Xia Yu could understand Su Tao’s thoughts after a brief consideration. Having an affair with a married woman still wasn’t enough to inflict a fatal blow to Wang Guofeng’s reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, Xia Yu reached home and sent the photos over to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Su Tao ultimately decided to send all of it over to Mo Sun’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A brief moment later, he received a reply from Mo Sun’er, “Don’t try and use cheap moves to ruin the relationship between my Senior Brother and me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when Su Tao wanted to explain to her, he realised that Mo Sun’er had blocked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he felt extremely depressed. The most lethal poison in the world was love. Not only did it destroy the body, but it would also destroy the soul. The moment one was struck, they would have their eyes blinded, and they wouldn't heed anyone's words!</span></p>
