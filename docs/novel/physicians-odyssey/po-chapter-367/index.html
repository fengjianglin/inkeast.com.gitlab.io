 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seated in the front passenger seat, Mo Sun’er kept her silence. The atmosphere was a little awkward, and even Su Tao felt that way. Was what he did earlier considered breaking apart two lovebirds?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sun’er, calm down a little and listen to my explanation.” Su Tao tried to alleviate the conflict between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t need your explanation, and please address me by my full name in the future. Our relationship can only be considered as an employer and employee. Please do not interfere with my personal life in the future. Although my Senior Sister trusts you, I don’t have the slightest favorable opinion about you. I have my own freedom, and I can leave the Three Flavour Hall at any time!” Mo Sun’er blurted out as she vented the emotions in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao patiently replied, “Although you feel that the relationship between us is that of an employer and employee, I don’t feel it that way. I’ve considered you a family member of mine!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his words, Mo Sun’er’s brows loosened up. However, she still spoke against her heart, “As if I’ll believe your words!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Su Tao smiled since that was Mo Sun’er’s character. Letting out a weak sigh, he replied, “Mo Sun’er, I don’t blame you for not believing me and choosing to believe in Wang Guofeng. But I know that you’ve already considered the Three Flavour Hall as your home, so I’m also a family member of yours. If anything happens to you, not only will I be worried, but Xiao Jingjing, Big Sister Lihua, Wang Peng, Zhao Jian, and the crowd will also be worried about you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Mo Sun’er’s tone softened, “They’re my family, except for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An awkward smile crept on Su Tao’s lips as he briefly pondered before letting out a sigh, “Looks like we need to talk to let you know how inexperienced and innocent you are when facing men!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a snort, Mo Sun’er turned and looked at the nightscape beyond the window.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Guofeng must have told you something along the line of… Sun’er, your Senior Sister and I have ended our relationship. But I don’t feel regretful at all since I’ve suddenly realised that you’re my true love. Because of the previous relationship coming to an end, I can now openly pursue you. I hope that you can promise me to try and accept my affection for you!” Su Tao spoke calmly as every single word jabbed into Mo Sun’er’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning her head over, Mo Sun’er was stunned as she looked at Su Tao for a long time before she said in confusion, “Did you follow me, or did you bug me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a massive difference in what Wang Guofeng told her, but Mo Sun’er noticed that the meaning behind it was the same. How did Su Tao know what Wang Guofeng told her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…Am I that untrustable in your heart?” Su Tao rolled his eyes. He could feel his blood gurgling in his throat before he sourly explained, “I only stood on Wang Guofeng’s standpoint and analysed how he would try to hoodwink and bluff you, silly girl!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible! You’re the one being silly!” Mo Sun’er bit on her lips as she threatened, “If you say anything about my Senior Brother again, I’ll get out of the car now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have to continue even if you jump out of the vehicle!” Su Tao sighed. This lass has been possessed and wouldn’t take his words seriously. “Wang Guofeng must have told you that you’re more suitable to be the Sect Master of the Aqua Cloud Stream and tells you to replace your Senior Sister before marrying him. This way, there will be a deeper relationship formed between the Medical Dao Sect and Aqua Cloud Stream.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Panic flickered in Mo Sun’er’s heart. This time, Su Tao was accurate for the first half of his words. Although Wang Guofeng did not tell her the second half, pondering about it now, Wang Guofeng did give her such hints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding onto her ears, Mo Sun’er shook her head to try and conceal the confusion in her heart and hollered, “Quiet!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was an excellent master when it came to psychological analysis. So when he saw how painful Mo Sun’er reacted, he knew that this lass had taken half of his words in, and it would be futile for him to continue speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vehicle did not return to the Three Flavour Hall, but came to the scenery by the river. The nightscape was dark without any stars. It was desolate except for the occasional couple jogging along. On the contrary, it was more romantic without anyone and was suitable for a talk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you bring me here?!” Mo Sun’er unhappily got out of the vehicle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because I want you to sober up!” Su Tao took a deep breath as he continued, “I won’t tell Ruochen what happened today, so I wish for it to be resolved by me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t thank you!” Mo Sun’er was worried that Su Tao might tell Liu Ruochen about how she spent time in the hotel with Wang Guofeng. In her heart, Liu Ruochen was someone important to her. Ever since she was young, Liu Ruochen would always appear whenever she encountered any problem to shield her from the storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the lass was still trying to act strong, Su Tao continued, “Society is complicated, and I can’t guarantee that Wang Guofeng has no feelings for you. But I’m certain that it’s not love. He’s only approaching you to hurt your Senior Sister since she betrayed him, so he set his target on you because he knows how important you are to Ruochen!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Mo Sun’er’s lips moved, she was powerless to refute those words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m trying to reach a deep collaboration with the Aqua Cloud Stream for talents to work in the Three Flavour Hall. Wang Guofeng appeared because he has also noticed the breakthrough and hopes to use you to disrupt the plan.” Su Tao went deeper into his analysis and continued, “If it goes as I’ve speculated, he will try to ask you to obtain the details of the collaboration between the Three Flavour Hall and Aqua Cloud Stream.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He won’t! Senior Brother Guofeng is a magnanimous man. He’s a gentleman, and he’s certainly not a hypocrite like you.” Mo Sun’er’s eyes were muddled as she was having conflicts in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that what he did was cruel since Wang Guofeng has been her idol ever since she was young, and they must’ve broken through the barrier earlier when she interacted with Wang Guofeng alone. However, his act of ruthlessly revealing the truth smashed her beautiful dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ridding the weed and not removing the roots would just breed future threats!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao continued, “Mo Sun’er, I’m only giving you my suggestion as an outsider by talking so much to you. It’s fine if you don’t believe me now, but I believe that you will know what to do when Wang Guofeng really tries to entice you to harm the Three Flavour Hall and Aqua Cloud Stream.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks for your reminder, but I choose to believe in Senior Brother Guofeng!” Mo Sun’er glanced at Su Tao before she turned and entered the car.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Helplessly shaking his head, a wry smile hung on his lips. He had his reason for helping Mo Sun’er while hiding this from Liu Ruochen. After all, if he told Liu Ruochen about it, his relationship with Mo Sun’er would worsen. Aside from that, it might even cause a dispute between Liu Ruochen and Mo Sun’er. In the end, it would only push her towards Wang Guofeng and she would be a tool to be used against the Three Flavour Hall and Aqua Cloud Stream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er was still too innocent. Perhaps Wang Guofeng might have been a gentleman in the past, but he has already changed. You take colors from those around you, and under Bai Fan’s influence, he’s changed.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the hotel, Wang Guofeng gulped down a few cups of red wine. His chest was raging with fiery anger, with his eyes turning cold. Su Tao has once again ruined his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He threw the cup and it slammed on the ground, where it shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the doorbell rang. Wang Guofeng did not even bother looking through the peephole and opened the door. At this moment, he had turned into someone that indulged in debauchery and would feel uncomfortable if no one was by his side on a daily basis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw a bewitching face upon opening the door, Wang Guofeng was startled, “Rangure? What are you doing here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jabbing on his head, Rangure smiled. “Why? Are you surprised?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wang Guofeng took a step back in embarrassment, Rangure looked at the mess on the floor before turning to Wang Guofeng. Shrugging her shoulders, she sighed, “You’ve disappointed me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s all due to Su Tao’s appearance! Otherwise, I could surely make Mo Sun’er stay today!” Wang Guofeng explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re wrong. I’m not disappointed because the plan failed, I’m concerned about your mind right now!” Rangure came to Wang Guofeng and her finger drifted down from his cheek to his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Guofeng tried to hold onto her hand, Rangure suddenly retracted it and she blew her finger. “I don’t like the current Wang Guofeng who seems weak. In my impression, Wang Guofeng should be a heroic and fearless man. But you’ve now become timid and lost your confidence!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Guofeng felt his throat turning dry, he said, “I will stand back up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Rangure replied, “You can only stand up after defeating Su Tao!
