 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiao Dehao’s fall had caused a great tremor in Hanzhou, especially when it implicated many issues. It had become the topic of the folks in Hanzhou. As for Xu Jiangang’s underground research facility, information about it was sealed to avoid public panic. Thus, people only knew about the explosion in the villa but nothing more about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the weather was getting colder, the water level in the canals have also started to drop. As a third-tired province, Hanzhou wasn’t especially huge. With the pedestrians on the streets decreasing and girls wearing more clothes, the beautiful scenery had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A team of five came to the Jianghuai Hospital for inspection. Although it was nominally said to check on the software in the Jianghuai Hospital, it’s actually to conduct an evaluation on two core staff members in the hospital, to see if they were capable enough to undertake a new post. This sort of evaluation usually was just a walkthrough procedure, since it had already been determined even before the evaluation. Then the team returned to Qiongjin, and approval for Wang Hong to assume the post of Jianghuai Hospital’s President and Su Tao as the Vice-President.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Achoo! Achoo!” Rubbing his nose, Su Tao sneezed, which seemed a little lacking in manners as he awkwardly smiled towards Vera. “Is there someone thinking about me or someone talking behind my back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising her lips, Vera shrugged. “There must be someone talking behind your back. You’ve done so many bad things, so you surely have a lot of enemies!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao shrugged as he took the cup of coffee from Vera and sighed, “So I’m only this much in your heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera acknowledged, “Yeah, isn’t there a Chinese proverb? Women love the bad guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Vera was joking, there were dark clouds hovering by her brows so Su Tao placed the cup down and asked, “You don’t seem happy, what’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao did not let the matter rest, so he smiled. “Remember, I’m your doctor. Before you fully recover from your disease, I have the responsibility to understand your thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at Su Tao, Vera sighed, “You're just over-sensitive. It’s really nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding onto his chin, Su Tao probed, “Is it related to your trip back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera tapped on her ample lips and sourly looked at him. “Stop bothering me, I don’t want to talk about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That fiancé of yours made you unhappy?” Su Tao pressed in harder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera briefly paused before the finally stretched her hands out. “Alright, you’ve guessed correctly! That bastard simply left me speechless! He actually hired a few gunmen to announce untrue information.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao continued to probe, “About your wedding?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera nodded her head. “Right, that fellow is too irresponsible. He said that we’re going to get married March next year.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief silence, Su Tao said, “Looks like the other party seems very anxious. I’m afraid he might force the marriage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rolling her eyes, Vera replied, “He still doesn’t dare to do that. But it was an idea given to him by my father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao instantly understood why Vera was so helpless. Her father was the one that would want the wedding to happen. After a brief consideration, he smiled. “If your mood isn’t good, then let me tell you a joke!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera blinked in expectation before she asked, “The distinguishing dirty jokes of China?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, black lines covered Su Tao’s head. “Doesn’t Russia have any dirty jokes?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Vera replied, “Russians are very passionate. They would speak what’s in their hearts, even vulgarities. Unlike China, where people like to bite words. Hmm, to describe with a word to describe the people in China would be outwardly cold but passionate inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao awkwardly smiled, since dirty jokes were, indeed, the culture in China here. In Western countries, they would also use sex as humor, but China’s humor stands out the most. This was also related to the oppressive atmosphere in society. With an earnest expression, Su Tao started to speak, “There’s a couple acting intimately in the park, and the woman told her man that her teeth hurt. The man proceeded to kiss her and asked if it was still hurting, which she replied, ‘Not anymore.’ A while later, the woman suddenly told the man that her neck hurts. The man then kissed her neck, and it no longer hurts. When an old lady saw that, she couldn’t help saying how miraculous the man’s mouth was and asked if it could treat hemorrhoids.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera couldn’t help dismissing it and said, “How vulgar!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thickening his face, Su Tao smiled as he explained, “It’s called being down-to-earth!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Supporting her chin, Vera blinked as she smiled. “Another one, but it must be meaningful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao felt the atmosphere was a little weird for him to be telling dirty jokes to a foreign chick, so he brewed up the emotions before saying, “Two cobs of corn got married. When the male corn woke up the next morning, he discovered popcorn lying beside him. Out of curiosity, he asked about the whereabouts of his wife. ‘You burst me up with a shot, and now, you’re pretending not to know me? Hmph!’ the popcorn then shyly replied.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera couldn’t hold back and laughed out, “You’re so bad! But your treatment works, my mood got better now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People say that music and poems weren’t differentiated by countries, but Su Tao felt that jokes were also a piece of knowledge. Despite the drastic difference in culture between China and the Western countries, there’s a market as long as it can make someone laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stretching her body, Vera paced about in the room before she softly said, “The Old Street’s project is starting soon, and if it goes as expected, we will have the largest filming village in Huainan, Three Flavour Hall packaged as the highlight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao nodded his head and smiled, “Package? Sounds interesting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pursing her lips, Vera smiled. “You need to provide some sources, which I will arrange for a team to draw up a trademark strategy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao smiled. “So I’m just riding along with the opportunity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera rolled her eyes. “Yeah, you’re pretty lucky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A professionally designed trademark strategy could easily go up to millions for a 5-A Marketing Company. Vera was just doing the trademark strategy design conveniently while reforming the Old Street. That’s the same as gifting Su Tao a few hundred million, which Su Tao could see the intangible benefits in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sweet music playing, quiet environment, and exquisite porcelain, shiny spoons, and a lovely cake on the table with the coffee fragrance drifting in the air. Su Tao realised that he had fallen a little and started to like such European-style mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera has already moved her venture capital company to the same building as the Three Flavour International, with a café built in the office. In the beginning, Yan Jing and Vera would often bump heads with conflicts between them. But after serious consideration, they had hired a management team. Ordinary matters were left to the management team, and pressing issues would be decided through the board meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s something that I need you to take a look at.” Vera took out a document and passed it to Su Tao with a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a look at it, Su Tao’s brows were knitted. “There are counterfeits of our products out in the market so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera nodded her head. “I have investigated into this matter. Those counterfeit products couldn’t even reach the effect of ours. They seized the opportunity to sell them with the hope of making up the numbers!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Counterfeit was a distinguishing feature of China. When a product becomes hot-selling, there would be a massive batch of counterfeits. It’s just that Su Tao never expected it to occur so quickly. From Vera’s expression, he could tell that they’ve suffered a serious loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knitting his brows, Su Tao said, “We’ll make an example out of someone. We’ll find a target to stop them for infringement to warn others.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera soon figured out Su Tao’s intention, so she nodded her head with a smile. “That’s right, I will inform the legal team later to send the lawyer’s letter to the few biggest companies. If there’s a need, we will even take legal actions against them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao nodded his head with a smile. “We might even be able to use this to advertise our products as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera was briefly stunned. Su Tao was smart. She sighed at his concept of seizing the opportunity to market and said, “You’re a qualified businessman.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an unknown and concealed clubhouse in Yunhai, Hans had buried his head low with rage written on his face with smoke rising from his cigar. He tossed the cigar towards the ashtray before taking a glass of wine on the desk and gulped it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting before him was a blonde chick that’s roughly in her thirties. She had lipstick applied to her ample lips, with charming and bright eyes. She wore a leader jacket that looked glossy, along with black stockings that wrapped around her slender legs, while her slim waist outlined perfect curves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That stupid Xu Jiangang is too crazy and caused such a big problem!” Hans said unhappily with his brows furrowed.</span></p>
