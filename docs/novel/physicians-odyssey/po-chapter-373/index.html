 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly 6 p.m. on Friday, Mo Sun’er and Xiao Jingjing entered a cab together. When Mo Sun’er saw Xiao Jingjing carrying a huge bag with her, she asked with a smile, “We’re only going for two days, so is there a need to bring so much stuff?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is completely empty! I want to get a card made in the Provincial Library to borrow a few medical books!” Xiao Jingjing smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a bookworm!” Mo Sun’er sourly replied. “Aside from the Medical Dao Sect, I don’t think there’s another place with more TCM medical books than the Aqua Cloud Stream. You just have to tell me if you want any.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to borrow a few western medicine books!” Xiao Jingjing continued to explain, “Yesterday, master told me that I am to participate in the test to become a research student and deepen my studies. So he picked western medicine for me since he feels that despite my decent knowledge in TCM, I lack in western medicine. So I’m preparing to tackle it in this period to try and obtain the status of a research student by the end of this year.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After looking at Xiao Jingjing with a complicated gaze, Mo Sun’er sighed, “A TCM student learning western medicine? Su Tao has too many thoughts!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite her words, she understood Su Tao’s intention for Xiao Jingjing. Even Mo Sun’er has read quite a few western medicine books and knew the difference of approach in the two medical studies so that she could provide a more comprehensive treatment method for her patients.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she could only be considered half-baked in western medicine, and she was lacking when compared to someone who has practised western medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, Mo Sun’er held Xiao Jingjing in admiration. She saw something in the latter that she was lacking. Although the latter did not have a talent in the eyes of others that were comparable to her own, Xiao Jingjing made up for the gap between them with her hard work and gulping down knowledge. In this period, when she interacted with Xiao Jingjing, she had also undergone a drastic change. She had read through the medical books once again and would often interact with Xiao Jingjing on her insights. This was how their close relationship was forged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the cab arrived at the transit, the two of them bought a bus ticket. For a bus that goes to Qiongjin City, there would be a bus every 15-minute interval. One and a half-hours later, the two of them arrived at Qiongjin City’s bus transit. Wang Guofeng had been waiting there for quite some time, and when he saw the arrival of Mo Sun’er and Xiao Jingjing, he immediately went up to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll bring the two of you over to the hotel to rest first before grabbing dinner. If you guys would like to experience Qiongjin City’s nightlife after dinner, I can accompany you guys as well.” Wang Guofeng spoke in a steady tone as he glanced at Mo Sun’er while the corner of his eyes was occasionally observing Xiao Jingjing’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xiao Jingjing had been maintaining a smile on her lips, which made Wang Guofeng give her an evaluation of a calm lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Wang Guofeng was driving them to a five-starred hotel, Mo Sun’er was inwardly excited despite not putting it into words. After all, Wang Guofeng has proven her position in his heart by giving her such a high treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll get a room for each of you. This way, it will be more convenient for the two of you to rest!” Wang Guofeng took two cards from the front desk and handed them to Mo Sun’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think there’s no need for such trouble, Sun’er and I can share one.” Xiao Jingjing interrupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, this is a five-starred hotel, and it must be pricey. Let’s save while we can!” Mo Sun’er also went along with Xiao Jingjing’s suggestion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng looked at Xiao Jingjing for a long time. The reason why he wanted two rooms was so that it would be convenient for him to visit Mo Sun’er. Thus, he generously smiled. “Don’t worry, this sum of money is still nothing to me! Just go ahead and stay. If you guys need any food at night, just call the operator!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xiao Jingjing whispered in Mo Sun’er’s ears, “I’m afraid to stay alone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a chuckle, Mo Sun’er replied, “Don’t worry, I won’t let you be lonely!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the two of them were whispering, their conversation was heard by Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he instantly felt a little unhappy in his heart. He felt that Xiao Jingjing’s existence was unnecessary, and he wondered if she was doing it on purpose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he calmly interrupted, “Are the two of you speaking behind my back? I’ve already heard it all! Forget it. I’ll get a shared room for you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe!” Mo Sun’er sweetly grinned after she achieved her objective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her smile made Wang Guofeng briefly dazed before he inwardly sighed. He knew that his heart had softened a little, but he gnashed his teeth and reminded himself that he couldn’t afford to be soft-hearted. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to get what he wanted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wang Guofeng got a suite for the two of them, he waited at the living room while the two of them unpacked their stuff inside the bedroom. Roughly half an hour later, the door was open and Wang Guofeng’s eyes lit up at first glance. Mo Sun’er had changed into a yellow goose coat. Although her figure wasn’t as voluptuous as Liu Ruochen’s, it was still refreshing. On the other hand, Xiao Jingjing wore a casual knitted jacket that permeated innocence and gentleness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the two of them, Wang Guofeng was deeply captivated by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go and have dinner!” Then again, Wang Guofeng was someone used to grand scenes. Thus, he managed to swiftly conceal his emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, he saw Mo Sun’er whispering a few words in Xiao Jingjing’s ears and exclaimed, “Sun’er, are you badmouthing me to Jingjing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could I?” Mo Sun’er’s lips rose as she playfully replied, “I told Jingjing to eat as expensively as she can!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a burst of laughter, Wang Guofeng nodded his head. “Right, just order as you like!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had seen Xiao Jingjing’s school roll and knew that she was an unsophisticated girl. So having her order was far better than letting Mo Sun’er do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they came to the dining hall on the second floor, the place was well decorated. Xiao Jingjing’s first reaction was to look around. After all, she was still a university student, and she lacked experience in society. Hence, everything felt fresh to her; the majestic wall ornaments, crystal chandeliers, soft carpet, and a piano placed in a corner with a white-collared lady playing a gentle tune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand to the waiter, the waiter bowed before he returned with a silver plate. The waiter wore white gloves and placed the golden menu beside Wang Guofeng. However, Wang Guofeng handed it over to Xiao Jingjing and smiled. “Since Sun’er has already said it earlier, then you can be the one to order today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xiao Jingjing looked at Wang Guofeng in hesitation, which the latter responded by nodding his head with encouragement in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh in difficulty, she swiftly flipped through the menu and was done with ordering in just thirty seconds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re done?” Wang Guofeng was briefly stunned and felt that Xiao Jingjing probably only ordered a few dishes. If food wasn’t enough, then it would be awkward. Thus, he added, “I’ll order a few dishes as well, then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The waiter bowed before he handed the list of orders to Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Guofeng swept a glance at it, his eyeballs nearly jumped out of their sockets.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How is this ordering? This is practically slaughtering!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He initially thought that Xiao Jingjing would order a few dishes that were reasonable in the quality-price ratio. Still, he never expected that she would go for the costly ones. A bowl of Abalone &amp; Vegetables at the cost of ¥8,888, three portions of Beef and Caterpillar Fungus Stew that cost ¥680 each, Tuna Platter at ¥688, and a few other dishes that were the most expensive in the menu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just this meal alone would cost more than ¥10,000!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wang Guofeng didn't lack money now, that didn’t mean that he could afford to throw it away like garbage! Looking at Xiao Jingjing’s innocent look, he felt an urge to strangle the death out of her rising in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mister, I think that the dishes ordered are more than enough for the three of you!” The waiter softly said when he saw that Wang Guofeng did not react after two to three minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was undoubtedly giving Wang Guofeng a way out of an embarrassing situation. As Wang Guofeng coughed, he squeezed out a smile. “Jingjing is pretty good at ordering food. She practically ordered all the famous dishes here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pursing her lips with a smile, Xiao Jingjing kept her silence. Her master had reminded her several times that if Wang Guofeng was treating them to a meal, she must definitely swindle a sum out of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when she was ordering, she felt her palms sweating. If her parents knew that this meal alone cost two years of their household income in the past, she would surely be severely reprimanded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after the dishes were served, Xiao Jingjing did not go easy. While Wang Guofeng and Mo Sun’er were chatting, she only paid attention to eating. But despite the costly food here, it didn’t come in great portions. So by the time Xiao Jingjing felt full, there wasn’t much food left on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inwardly, Wang Guofeng gnashed his teeth with hatred as Mo Sun’er further encouraged Xiao Jingjing to eat more. However, he could only helplessly bury the hatred in his belly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not eat much this meal; it was mainly due to the anger blazing in his heart. However, he had to maintain his bearing since Xiao Jingjing was the best friend of Mo Sun’er. But when he paid the bill, he was aching in his heart. If there was an opportunity in the future, then he had to make Xiao Jingjing spit out what she ate today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are a few pubs nearby, why don’t we go there?” Wang Guofeng suggested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s not. Sun’er, I’m a little sleepy!” Xiao Jingjing said wearily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Wang Guofeng’s heart raged.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sleeping after eating? Are you a pig?!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;If Xiao Jingjing was fatter and uglier, he might have probably exploded on the spot. However, she looked innocent and pitiful, so he could only suppress the rage in his heart. “Why don’t you return to the room and rest? I’ll go with Sun’er!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Mo Sun’er also wanted to have some time alone with Wang Guofeng, she smiled. “Jingjing, you can go back and rest first. I’ll take a walk with Senior Brother!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh…” Xiao Jingjing furrowed her brows and pondered before saying, “Then I’ll go with you guys. Who knows, I might not feel tired anymore in a pub!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng initially thought that he could shake Xiao Jingjing off, but he never expected that the third wheel would come and join them again. However, he could only continue to cover up and chuckled, “Alright, let’s go together then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Mo Sun’er felt something unusual since Xiao Jingjing’s actions today weren't normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Xiao Jingjing came to her ears and whispered, “Am I doing a great job as a third wheel?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sourly rolling her eyes, Mo Sun’er replied, “How are you a third wheel? You’re practically the night’s brightest star!”</span></p>
