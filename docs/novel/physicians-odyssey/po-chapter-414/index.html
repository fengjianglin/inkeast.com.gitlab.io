 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to ensure that the venom wouldn’t spread throughout her body, Su Tao drew a long cut to the edge of her trousers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he looked at it, he felt relieved after seeing that the venom only spread to the knee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to admit that since Jiang Qinghan trained her body often, her entire leg seemed like a piece of art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was a pity that it wasn’t the time for him to admire her. Taking a deep breath, he inserted two needles into the Ququan Acupoints on two sides of the knee. Once Qi was injected in, the vessels locked like gates, stopping the blood from circulating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Su Tao merged the Heavenseizing Hands with the Bianque Hands to perform a massage for Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan only felt a numbing sensation on her knee and she couldn’t help feeling nervous. She nearly cried out due to a current that stimulated her body, which felt itchy and numbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was mainly due to the venom being concealed, and it did not produce an effect of numbing the nerves. On the contrary, Jiang Qinghan’s body is extremely sensitive, so it was unavoidable for her to have a reaction when someone of the opposite sex was performing a massage for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She held her breath and was startled. She was actually enjoying Su Tao’s massage. His hands were like two feathers moving up and down on her leg, making her feel an itch and urge to clamp her legs together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has she gone insane?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A long-forgotten sensation rippled from her abdomen and she tried her best to calm her heart from losing control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the conflict that Jiang Qinghan was undergoing, Su Tao locked his brows together. Although the door was shut, there was a peculiar scent that permeated into the car.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s heart trembled. At this moment, he recalled the words of that old man. It wouldn’t really come true for there to be bloodshed within three days, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could it be that he and Jiang Qinghan have fallen for Zhao Yongde’s plot?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, someone must have purposely nurtured such an unusual snake venom, and if no one saved her in time, then she would surely lose her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that he’s here, Zhao Yongde changed his plans and let out an unnoticeable poison scent instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the fragrance was faint, Su Tao could still detect it. Hence, he immediately held his breath. However, Jiang Qinghan couldn’t resist it and showed symptoms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scent was mixed with Epimedium. Not only did it boost one’s sexual drive, but it also had a unique effect on treating men. It was often used by vets to boost the sexual drive in livestock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This poisonous scent had two main effects, by blurring one’s mind and stimulating the blood to circulate the poison faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao, what’s wrong with me? I feel weaker and weaker!” Jiang Qinghan asked as her eyes were blurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It will be fine in a bit.” Su Tao knew that he couldn’t afford to explain to Jiang Qinghan at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already forced the venom to the red dots, and if given enough time, he could use fire cupping to suck the venom out. But there’s no time for that, since he had no idea if Zhao Yongde might try and use other tricks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he could only bend down and suck on the wound bitten by the venomous snake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was trying to save a life, and not taking advantage of Jiang Qinghan… absolutely not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Jiang Qinghan was half-conscious, she still knew what Su Tao was doing in her mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan subconsciously straightened her feet, forming a beautiful arc with her leg and made her skin look tender as it tensed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking down that line, one can look at her casual trousers that were cut open. It was like a veil as it draped down like an ornament.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that he was under the influence of the poisonous scent that caused him to lose his focus. At this moment, he was trying his very best to control his emotions while gently applying pressure on Jiang Qinghan’s leg so that the venom could be better extracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan felt both numbing and itching. Despite knowing that Su Tao was treating her leg, she had no idea why she would feel so nervous and excited. It was akin to sitting on a rollercoaster ride and her body was like a collapsed dam as raging emotions swept through her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing Jiang Qinghan’s unusual changes, Su Tao was also startled. Jiang Qinghan wouldn’t have gone to cloud nine and become a fairy, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he couldn’t afford to let his thoughts wander as the enemy was hidden nearby. Otherwise, he would definitely fan the fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite both of them being drugged, they still managed to keep the distinction of their relationship as master and disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing what just happened to her body, Jiang Qinghan felt both frustrated and bashful. Hence, she immediately closed her eyes and pretended to faint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao couldn’t be bothered if she has really fainted or if she was faking it. Although the snake venom was sucked out in time, it still took a hit on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body swayed and he laid down on Jiang Qinghan’s legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With her eyes closed, Jiang Qinghan was in an awkward situation. Su Tao had fainted, and she couldn’t wake up at this moment either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Su Tao’s whisper resounded, “Master, don’t move!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Jiang Qinghan’s heart was swept by frustration and bashfulness. She felt bashful because Su Tao had seen through her act, while she felt frustrated since Su Tao had pretended to faint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the two of them laid on each other, footsteps resounded ten-odd minutes later, which Su Tao could determine that those were the footsteps of two people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Martial Uncle, you’re truly brilliant! I never expected that the two of them would fall for it so easily!” A sinister and young voice resounded. “You’re truly the person that I admire the most!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop bootlicking; we still have to be cautious. Here, take this knife and try cutting them.” Zhao Yongde cautiously said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man nodded his head and carefully opened the door before dragging Su Tao out. When he took a glance at Jiang Qinghan, his eyes were fixed on her legs and licked his lips. “Martial Uncle, this woman looks pretty good. I’ve still not experienced a woman at my age, so can I feel her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t cause trouble!” Zhao Yongde coldly snorted. “Get it done quickly. After we’ve finished, I’ll find a few girls for you back at Guangdong for a few nights!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hehe! I know that it’s good working for Martial Uncle.” The young man chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning around, he stared at Su Tao for a long time before saying, “Brother, I’m sorry, but you can only blame yourself for offending the Grand Elder of our Witchcraft Sect. You’re the first life that I will be taking, and I will be praying for your death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing his Martial Nephew being so naggy, Zhao Yongde kicked his butt and urged, “Quick!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when the young man wanted to brandish the knife at Su Tao’s neck, he suddenly exclaimed before taking two steps back and warned, “Martial Uncle, watch out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed. Zhao Yongde’s Martial Nephew was a practitioner of martial arts. Although the latter sounded like a fool in his speech, he was still cautious. Hence, Su Tao failed to fool him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Nephew jumped five to six meters out and cautiously looked at Su Tao. “Martial Uncle, stand behind me. Let me deal with him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful!” Zhao Yongde warned despite knowing his Martial Nephew’s skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from that, his gaze fell onto the car. He clearly wanted to make a move against Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Jiang Qinghan was skilled in martial arts, she was bitten by a snake and felt dizzy. Hence, she couldn’t get up no matter how she struggled and could only helplessly look at the fight between Su Tao and Zhao Yongde’s Martial Nephew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Su Tao was worried that Jiang Qinghan might be harmed, he had to divide his attention in this fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the person before him was only a hairline away from Liu Jianwei’s level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His moves were unusual and tricky, and Su Tao wasn’t experienced in facing a martial artist. Although he could deal with the usual goons, he couldn’t obtain the upper hand in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single time when the knife wanted to slash down at him, he only managed to avoid it by a hairline with his powerful flexibility and reaction time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Below!” Although Jiang Qinghan still felt powerless, her eyesight was retained. So when she saw Su Tao having such a tough time, she immediately gave out instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Martial Nephew really attacked Su Tao’s bottom, but due to the timely warning, Su Tao managed to avoid it while swinging a punch at his attacker’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His attacker felt a surge of sweetness in his throat before a mouthful of blood gushed out with his face turning grave. He realised that Su Tao was stronger than he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s fists contained Qi, and if he carelessly suffered a blow, he wouldn’t have a good time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao was putting what he practiced into use and executed the Internal Fist Technique that he learned from Yan Wujin earlier today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Strike his right rib!” Jiang Qinghan managed to analyse the weak spot of Zhao Yongde’s nephew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the first success, Su Tao had absolute trust for Jiang Qinghan’s instructions. Facing the knife swinging in his direction, he did not even bother to avoid and threw out a jab at this attacker’s rib.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his flaw being taken advantage of, Zhao Yongde’s Martial Nephew nearly went insane. He immediately took a few steps back before he managed to avoid Su Tao’s assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Martial Uncle, tear that woman’s mouth off!” At this moment, his rage was blowing over his top. “Otherwise, I won’t be able to defeat this fellow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Yongde’s eyes flashed with viciousness as he replied, “Keep him occupied, I’ll deal with the woman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao instantly panicked in his heart. He wanted to turn around to save Jiang Qinghan. However, the Martial Nephew was unleashing swift moves at him, which he could only defend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Yongde swiftly came to the door and dragged Jiang Qinghan by her feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a shriek, Jiang Qinghan was dragged out of the car and Zhao Yongde sneered with a small knife in his hand and stabbed it down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“You can only blame yourself for offending me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a moment of desperation, Jiang Qinghan could only attempt to block it. However, it was futile as Zhao Yongde slapped Jiang Qinghan’s cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when he wanted to make his move again, his wrist suddenly felt numb. There was a needle stuck to his wrist, and his dagger powerlessly fell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking advantage of this crucial moment, Jiang Qinghan exploded her hidden potential and grabbed ahold of the dagger then pushed it forth. Zhao Yongde groaned with his eyes widened as fresh blood poured from his wound before he fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after dealing with Zhao Yongde, Jiang Qinghan’s expression did not look good as Su Tao suffered a cut on his back when he unleashed a needle to save her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a long wound inflicted with blood staining his robe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After discovering that he couldn’t take Su Tao down in a short time, the attacker cried out and glanced at Zhao Yongde, who was collapsed on the ground, before he swiftly ran off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking in the direction of Zhao Yongde’s Martial Nephew disappearing from his sight, Su Tao suddenly felt weak and he collapsed on the ground.</span></p>
