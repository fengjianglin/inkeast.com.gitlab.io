 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Su Tao and company entered Miao Yugen’s villa, they heard struggles coming from the kitchen. Hence, Liu Jianwei immediately charged forth to take a look. His anger immediately blew up when he saw Fan Lihua’s husband having his pants down and being in a tangle with Liu Ye. Hence, he made a move and threw Miao Yurong out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xiao Jingjing and Shui Junzhuo saw this scene, they immediately turned around, since they were still unwed. Therefore, they did not dare to look at Miao Yurong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Liu Ye wore her clothes, she sobbed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this the so-called ‘kicking someone when they’re down’?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Zhongtian had also witnessed this scene and felt compassion in his heart. Glancing at Miao Yurong, he cussed, “Fucking scum!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Fan Lihua’s face was pale. Although she no longer has any feelings for Miao Yurong, he was still the father of her daughter. Not to mention that the two of them were still considered husband and wife before the law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Miao Zhongtian turned to Fan Lihua, “Lihua, I support you in your decision to divorce Yurong that you told me yesterday!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising her head, Fan Lihua’s eyes flickered with tears. But no one knew if she was touched or was she feeling regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Miao Yurong regained his consciousness, he was startled when he saw so many people in the courtyard. Thus, he immediately dragged his trousers and wanted to escape. However, Liu Ye chased after him and threw a rock over. Being struck by the rock, Miao Yurong shirked and briefly fell on the ground before holding onto his head, which was covered in blood, and continued to run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Returning to the courtyard, Liu Ye looked at Miao Zhongtian with guilt. “Second Uncle, I’m sorry!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Miao Zhongtian sighed, “Physician Su insisted on coming to take a look at Yugen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her tears were filled with regret as Liu Ye explained, “Yugen was forced to do all those bad things. I’ll apologise on his behalf.” As she spoke, she gave a deep bow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching this scene, Su Tao sighed. Liu Ye might seem to be a flirtatious woman, but she was loyal to her husband. Hence, he said, “Although I have been sold out by Miao Yugen, I’ve still decided to save him. It’s against my principle to do things half-heartedly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Ye heard about Su Tao’s superb medical skills, she immediately kneeled. “Physician Su, I’m willing to do anything for you as long as you can treat Yugen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head with a wry smile, Su Tao replied, “I don’t need you to do anything for me. Do more charity and stop doing any more evil in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they entered the house, Miao Yugen had already regained consciousness. When he saw Su Tao, he was first startled before he felt regretful. Su Tao had saved him, but he bit the hand that fed him. Humans are emotional beings. Miao Yugen might be a bad person, but he wasn’t entirely hopeless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed when he looked at Miao Yugen’s expression. “I’m treating you out of my responsibility as a physician. I hope that you can be a proper person after you recover.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking his words, he waved his hand and got everyone to leave the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Yugen’s condition was severe, and his treatment yesterday only stabilised Miao Yugen’s condition for the time being. But he still needed acupuncture and medicine to recover completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing behind Su Tao, Xiao Jingjing’s gaze flickered. She could sense the holiness of a physician from him. Without any lectures, Su Tao gave her a lesson through his actions, the meaning of healing hands, and the compassion of a doctor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao started his acupuncture, it was like the past. His acupuncture was akin to a dazzling performance, and every single movement was precise, as if they were taken out from textbooks. Every single time Xiao Jingjing witnessed Su Tao’s performance, she would gain a new comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without her knowing, Su Tao had risen to a saint in her heart. Even the revered Hua Tuo and Bian Que weren’t comparable to Su Tao’s position in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fractures on Miao Yugen were secondary, his internal bleeding was more serious. Especially when there was internal bleeding in his head that could put his life in jeopardy if it wasn’t given immediate attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In western medicine, surgery would be required. But he naturally did not have the proper environment to operate. Thus, he used his Qi and acupuncture to mediate the flow of blood in Miao Yugen’s head. This wasn’t a simple task, and it took two hours before Miao Yugen was out of danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao wrote down a prescription, he handed it over to Xiao Jingjing. However, he noticed that she was dazed and jabbed her in her forehead. “What are you thinking?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recovering from her daze, Xiao Jingjing stuck her tongue out and smiled. “Master, why did you save him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t do it for him. I did it for everyone in the village.” Su Tao smiled as he walked out of the room. “If they see my act of kindness, they will have more trust in us. Furthermore, it is also a good deed if I can get Miao Yugen to change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Xiao Jingjing couldn’t fully understand Su Tao’s actions. However, she felt that there must be a reason for that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Miao Yugen is temporarily fine, for now. Give the prescription to Liu Ye and have her brew the medicine for him every night. He will recover after half a year of resting!” Su Tao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, Liu Ye knelt on the floor and kowtowed her head on the floor as she sobbed, “Physician Su, you’re a living Bodhisattva!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Supporting Liu Ye up, Su Tao replied, “Remember, you guys must live a different life from the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished his words, he immediately left Miao Yugen’s villa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Covering her face, tears dripped down Liu Ye’s fingers from being too emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Shui Junzhuo was only a spectator, she could sense a peculiar charm from Su Tao. She could feel her heart racing as a gentle smile spread on the corner of her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The story of the farmer and the snake was to warn others to be cautious of who you’re giving charity to, and not everyone would be grateful to you. On the contrary, they might even bite you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao has issued a statement through his actions. Even if he knew that his patient was a snake, and he would be bitten, he would still give out charity. As for the reason? He’s a physician, not a farmer. Saving lives was the duty of every healer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Missy, Physician Su is a foolish good man!” Ah Jun was a soldier, and only enemies and comrades existed in his world. Thus, he couldn't understand Su Tao’s values.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only living differently, are we ourselves.” Shui Junzhuo’s eyes flickered as she continued, “Tell grandfather about this matter in full detail.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah Jun sighed, “The old man will surely say that Physician Su is soft-hearted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, he won’t. Being cruel to the weak is no hero. On the other hand, my grandfather will be touched by his actions.” Shui Junzhuo smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they returned to Miao Zhongtian’s home, there was a somewhat tattered car parked outside and Miao Zhongtian’s wife came out immediately. “Old Miao, quick! Mr. Leng has been waiting for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing the words of his wife, Miao Zhongtian, was stunned. Why would a famous official from the town suddenly pay a visit? Thus, he immediately ran into his house. A brief moment later, Leng Yuan walked out and came over to Su Tao and shook hands. “Physician Su, nice to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His reason was explicit, he was here for Su Tao. However, Su Tao had never seen this person before, so he was a little awkward. Seeing this, Miao Zhongtian immediately introduced, “This is an official from the town, Leng Yuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief introduction, he was an official just like Xuan Wangjun. However, he would be taking over the matters so that there wouldn’t be any complications. The news of Xuan Wangjun being arrested was just released, and Leng Xuan had already come looking for him in high spirits. Evidently, that meant that he wasn’t in the same camp as Xuan Wangjun, and they’re considered competitors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting it in a nutshell, Su Tao had done him a great favor, which was the reason why Leng Yuan was so polite to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the living room, Leng Yuan sighed, “I’ve heard about the incident. I represent the organisation to apologise for the troubles you encountered because of Xuan Wangjun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Su Tao smiled. “There are black sheep everywhere. I believe that the number of good people prevails over evildoers in the world. Don’t worry. I won’t hold a grudge because of this matter. Furthermore, I would like to invest in Miao Village.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Invest?” Leng Yuan was surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Zhongtian drank tea from the side. He hadn’t reported this matter to the town yet. But since Leng Yuan was here, then they could deal with the issue here. With Leng Yuan’s support, it would be easier in the procedures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I intend to purchase Miao Village’s mountain.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“May I ask why you are buying the mountain?” Leng Yuan found it hard to believe, since Miao Village was the most remote village in Baitan Town, and it wasn’t accessible with vehicles. If it was raining, the road would be covered in mud, and they could only walk on foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m a Physician, and I have my own pharmacy in Hanzhou City. So I intend to set up a wild medicine garden here.” Su Tao frankly answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s a good thing!” Leng Yuan rubbed his hands in excitement. Although the investment from Hans went down the drain, they now had another investment. Regardless of the sum, it would be a decent profit for the organisation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for Miao Village’s roads…” Just when Su Tao was about to ask, he was interrupted by Leng Yuan halfway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The funds for the roads have already been allocated a few years ago, but someone had obstructed them from the shadows. Please be reassured. I will handle this matter starting tomorrow and have the road built in three… no, two months!” Leng Yuan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Miao Zhongtian grinned with his yellow teeth revealed. The past two days were really exciting ones with twists and turns. A divine physician came to their village. Not only did he treat everyone in the village suffering from Big-Foot Disease, but he even resolved the road issues that troubled them for years.</span></p>
