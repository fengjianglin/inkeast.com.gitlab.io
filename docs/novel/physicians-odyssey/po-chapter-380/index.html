<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The weather was beautiful and sunny with new leaves growing out of the two willow trees. Although the shoots were still tiny, they were extremely attractive and would occasionally sway along with the breeze. As Su Tao examined the wall, he saw that the ground soil near the wall had been touched. It was tidied into a two and a half meter-width and five to six meter-long field with four rows. There were also two water buckets placed near the door with nails hammered into the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Noticing those details, Su Tao asked, “You intend to grow crops in the courtyard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Sire Shui smiled. “It’s just something meant to kill time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pursing his lips, Su Tao shook his head with a smile and did not continue his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Su Tao’s reaction, Sire Shui was perplexed, before he said, “Speak anything you have in mind. Don’t ruin the mood!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, I’ll say it, but please don’t hold it against me!” Su Tao first gave a vaccine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Sire Shui smiled. “Am I such a petty person? Just speak your mind, I promise that I won’t hold it against you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Su Tao said “I just recalled a joke that during a conversation between the Chairman of a company and his subordinates, he would reminisce about his past. He had a field back home and would often grow crops together with his elders, which he would often fall asleep in the field. So when someone took notice of it, they specially created a field in the company to please the Chairman.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Jin Guoxiang instantly knitted his brows.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t Su Tao mocking the old man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Locking his brows together, Sire Shui looked unhappy before he slammed his hand on the table and cursed, “That’s rubbish! An office is a place for work, so how can it be turned into a field? I’ve also heard of this story, and those people should really be sorted. Many Major Generals took advantage of their authority, not to mention that rotten bags surrounded them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Jin Guoxiang immediately smiled as he added, “Su Tao is mocking those bootlickers; it’s not targeted at you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile creeping on his lips, Sire Shui glanced at Jin Guoxiang. “You don’t have to overthink it. We’re just chatting, and there’s no need to be so serious. I won’t mind it even if he’s really making fun of me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Sire Shui has a wide breadth of mind, Su Tao continued, “Actually, I really think that it’s not suitable for Sire Shui to grow these kinds of crops.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Sire Shui smiled. How many youngsters would dare to say those words to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a straight face, Su Tao continued, “Living in the world, all of us have our own duties. For that Chairman, he should put more energy towards the operation of his company. A company is a place for work, and it shouldn’t be turned into a farming field. As for you, I think that growing these kinds of crops would lower your status, and I’m afraid that you will be a joke to others if they know about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve already retired, so can’t I grow some crops in my courtyard?” Sire Shui sourly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting to the side, Jin Guoxiang did not join into this conversation since he could tell that Sire Shui and Su Tao weren’t arguing, but they were just enjoying a war of words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not these types of crops!” Su Tao firmly shook his head. “But, you can try growing other stuff!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Sire Shui pointed at Su Tao and laughed. “So that’s what you have in mind! Come, tell me. What do you think is suitable for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao took out a small bottle from his medical box and poured out a few yellow seeds. “I suggest you stop growing fruits and vegetables in your field. Here are a few types of seeds for herbs. You can grow them if you’re bored, and they can improve the environment of your courtyard. Growing medicinal herbs is much more superior than growing normal crops!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stinking brat, so this is your motive by beating around the bush!” Although Sire Shui sounded as if he was reprimanding, he was actually feeling pleasant since chatting with Su Tao would always be unexpected yet reasonable. As someone of his status, it’s rare for anyone to dare and joke around with him. Even his children were respectful to him, fearing that they might anger him with their words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao did not have that many worries. Despite his young age, he could speak freely, perhaps due to his profession as a physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao wasn’t planning anything, but he felt that if Sire Shui wanted to grow something in his field, then he should try growing herbs. Although those herbs couldn’t turn into delicacies like vegetables, they could improve the environment upon maturity, which would bring benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Glancing at Su Tao’s medical box, Sire Shui asked with a smile, “I’m inquisitive. What do you have in that medical box that you bring with you all the time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile creeping on his face, Su Tao replied, “It’s just stuff to make a living, and please forgive me that I can’t allow you to examine it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Sire Shui unhappily glared at him and sourly cussed, “Who cares about that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin Guoxiang immediately gave Su Tao an eye signal, which the latter could only helplessly open his medical box. “It’s just some equipment like acupuncture needles, fire cups, and some commonly used pellets. It’s usually the same for most physician’s medical boxes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at the texture of the medical box, Sire Shui was briefly stunned before he asked, “This box should have some age, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his thumbs, Su Tao praised, “Formidable eyesight! This has a history of nearly 200 years!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was just teasing Sire Shui earlier. As someone at his status, what treasure hasn’t Sire Shui seen before? His medical box wasn’t anything special, but it was just rare for someone to use a traditional TCM medical box nowadays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to western medicine’s outpatient box, the TCM medical box had another name for it, the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s medical box was made with rosewood, which was resistant against wear and tear. It was separated into a few levels, in which the first level could be pulled apart. As for the side, it could be opened like a drawer with small compartments. Aside from acupuncture, fire cups, and stone needles, writing material was placed in another drawer. Naturally, there was also a writing brush, but it wasn’t often used since Su Tao usually used pens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The center layer contained bottles of all sizes. Although there weren’t any labels on the bottles, they were differentiated by their sizes and colors. They each contain commonly used medicines for emergency cases. But they wouldn’t be used unless there was an emergency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lowest drawer had the most abundant compartment, which Sire Shui smiled when he looked at it. It actually contained a bottle of water, two packets of instant noodles, a stick of round biscuits, and also a palm-sized bowl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why do you have these in here?” Jin Guoxiang’s curiosity was piqued as he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile on his lips, Su Tao explained, “A habit of mine! In ancient times, due to the inconvenience during outpatient visits, it would usually take days. Hence, physicians would usually bring small bites with them when needed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Sire Shui said, “All professions truly have their own rules and regulations. Today has been eye-opening for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Su Tao carefully packed up his medical box. It was a box that Cai Zhongpu once offered him a high price for, which was ultimately rejected by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Zhongpu often dealt with antiques, so how could he not know that the price of this medical box didn’t lie in its age, but the Tang Dynasty’s craftsmanship, which he was sure from the craftsmanship and design of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Cai Zhongpu was curious because, despite the fact that rosewood was used as its material, it shouldn’t be so well-preserved after so many years. But because of his perplexion, Cai Zhongpu ultimately decided to give up on the medical box.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After dinner, Su Tao bade his farewells. Although Sire Shui wanted Su Tao to stay for the night, the old man knew that Su Tao had many things on his hand. Thus, he did not insist, and when Su Tao left, the old man shoved something over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao got into the jeep, he handed the item over to Jin Guoxiang and asked, “What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile plastered on his lips, Jin Guoxiang exclaimed, “I never expected that the Chief would actually be willing to give this item to you! It’s called a Fire Beacon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fire Beacon?” Su Tao was perplexed. When he looked at this, it was the length of a finger in the shape of ivory. The tip was thick, while the end was slim. It was grey with a hint of gold, looking old. There was also a fire symbol engraved at the top of it, that further added to the majestic appearance of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The maple leaf dyed in the blood of heroes as the Fire Beacon stabilises the mighty country!” Jin Guoxiang explained. “You can consider this to be a protection talisman, and showing this to any special department in the nation will grant you special treatment. According to my knowledge, the old man has only given out three Fire Beacons, with you included, and all of them have a unique status.” When he finished his explanation, Jin Guoxiang revealed the name of a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shock instantly flashed in Su Tao’s eyes, since the person mentioned by Jin Guoxiang was someone that everyone knew. It was a famous entrepreneur who was well-known throughout the globe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Giving a deep look at Su Tao, Jin Guoxiang smiled. “The reason why Sire Shui gave you the Fire Beacon was due to his foresight in you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a smile, Su Tao stowed the Fire Beacon and pondered that he might be able to use it in the future when he played the prey to hunt the predator!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have something that I would like to ask of you!” Su Tao sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to be so courteous to me!” Jin Guoxiang smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wish to meet Bai Fan!” Su Tao continued to explain his reason, “After fighting with him for such a long time, I suddenly want to understand his thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Jin Guoxiang replied, “Sure! I’ll bring you over now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, Su Tao was actually in a dilemma whether he should meet with Bai Fan or not. In the end, he decided to meet this cunning opponent of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly half an hour later, the military jeep arrived at the prison that kept Bai Fan. Because Bai Fan’s case was a little special, he wasn’t held together with the other prisoners, and it was impossible to escape with the layer of defenses here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Fan saw Su Tao, he was unexpectedly calm without any emotions. His hair had been shaved and he was donned in prison clothes. His gaze was desolate with a wound on the corner of his lips. Clearly, it was something he gained after coming to prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected that you would come to see me!” Bai Fan said in a hoarse voice. “But it’s understandable. Are you trying to flaunt your victory at me? The winner takes all, and the loser is left with nothing; I understand this logic!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao softly said, “I only want to inform you that if everything goes within my expectations, I will bankrupt the Medicine Deity Corporation within two months!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, Bai Fan’s gaze changed with hatred and rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao did not speak any further but stood up and left, showing his departing silhouette towards Bai Fan. This was his stance as the victor!</span></p>
