 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao wanted it the hard way, and Bai Fan has already tried using peaceful measures before resorting to violence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two people charged over. They were after Su Tao’s arms to restrain him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was an ordinary person, they would be terrified to have six guns pointed at them, and they might even pee in their pants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Su Tao wasn’t a pushover. His arm slipped through the grasp of a person with a tricky angle before he twisted and restrained that person’s arm while lashing a kick at the wrist of another person, which made the pistol fly up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he struck one of them in the neck and knocking that person unconscious, he leaped into the air while stepping on the dishes that filled the table before dropping down to the ground and stood behind Rangure. While holding onto Rangure’s neck with one hand, the pistol fell into his other hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It all took place in the blink of an eye, and it was like a scene straight out of a movie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through Yan Wujin’s guidance, Su Tao’s martial arts have advanced by leaps and bounds. He was not only an outstanding physician, but he was also an excellent martial artist now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pointing the pistol at Rangure’s temple, he turned off the safety and smiled. “I’m sorry, but I’ll be making you a hostage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching this scene, Bai Fan’s eyes grimly flickered. He never expected that Su Tao would be so formidable. Despite all his preparations, it still ultimately failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let him go!” Rangure deeply said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, a wry smile crept on Bai Fan’s lips. He knew that Rangure wasn’t talking to him, but that foreign man who was tasked with her safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He might have six gunmen, but they were all useless when compared to Su Tao. In the entire Intoxicated Countryside Pavilion, only that foreign man could make Su Tao stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Three minutes from now, I wish to see a vehicle when I go down!” Su Tao looked at Bai Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure!” Despite the reluctance, Bai Fan coldly agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grabbing onto Rangure, Su Tao had his guard up against her counterattack. He could tell from her physique that she must’ve trained in martial arts. He had used a grip with his fingers against her artery, and he only had to apply pressure to knock her out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps Rangure had sensed the threat from Su Tao’s fingers; she did not make any movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they came down, Bai Fan really did prepare a vehicle. It was a black Toyota Sedan. Su Tao hugged Rangure into the front passenger seat and ordered, “Crawl to the driver’s seat and drive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the narrow space in the front passenger seat, Rangure was seated on Su Tao’s lap. Su Tao was in a tense state, since he knew the danger of Rangure. Hence, he did not consider her to be a woman. He was trying his best to brainwash himself that it was only a fat hippopotamus seated on his lap. This hippopotamus was not the slightest bit lovely, and she’s even more terrifying than a charging bull on the field. So he had to be cautious, or he would be eaten up by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Men were that troublesome, especially someone at Su Tao’s age, since they might be in an awkward situation anytime around 70% of the day, and this moment wasn’t an exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was in the right position and wore leather trousers. Hence, the sensation was extraordinary. She gave Su Tao a smile, which seemed to say she could see through anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Awkward, the current situation was too awkward!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he have a reaction for a hippopotamus?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being a German, Rangure had a petite figure. Hence, she easily crawled over to the driver’s seat and turned around to have a deep look at Su Tao before pursing her lips. “Don’t worry about that. I’ve already given out the orders to let you go, and you can put the gun down. Why don’t we have a chat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t try any tricks with me!” Su Tao knitted his brows as he looked at Rangure with vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finding Su Tao adorable, Rangure licked her dry lips and teased, “Are you having a reaction for me? I felt it when I boarded the car earlier!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holy shit, why is this woman so blatant?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Such an awkward matter shouldn’t be spoken out loud, and it should be treated as dust to drift along with the wind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao had no intention to care about Rangure. Sensing that she might be trying to use this matter to divert his attention, he pushed the pistol against her temple. “Drive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pursing her lips, Rangure started the car and slammed on the gas while turning the steering wheel proficiently. The vehicle was like an arrow that left the bow and shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After giving out a signal, Bai Fan did not get his men to follow after. On the other hand, that foreign man entered a black SUV and turned on his phone before tapping an application with a red dot on the map. He had installed a tracker on Rangure for him to easily track her location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll just follow and take a look!” Although he knew that nothing could happen to Rangure with her skills, he still wore his sunglasses and started the car. As the SUV drifted, it chased after the location stated on the tracking application.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Sedan, Su Tao looked at the indicator. They’re now in the urban district, and all vehicles were required to drive under fifty. But the vehicle had flown over a hundred with Rangure turning on the music. Soon, a rhythm resounded and she smiled while tapping her fingers on the steering wheel along with the tempo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the hostage being so relaxed, Su Tao felt that he lacked in confidence if he kept a gun to her temple. Thus, he used a napkin to wipe his fingerprints before removing the ammunition clip and casually tossed the pistol to the backseat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you getting a little too careless?” Rangure turned to look at Su Tao and smiled. “Are you not afraid that I will turn the car around and send you back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nope!” Su Tao smiled. “It’s all cameras here, and I don’t want to be taped pointing a gun in the face of a woman.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting!” Rangure chuckled as she asked, “I’m very interested in you! I initially had my eyes on Wang Guofeng, but I now feel that you’re more charismatic. How about this, I’ll invest in you and create a business empire for you. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They say that women are ever-changing, and it’s totally true! Aren’t you investing in Bai Fan? So why do you want to invest in me now?” Although Su Tao tossed the pistol away, he never let down his vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wide investment is my part of my philosophy.” Despite the red lights, Rangure directly charged over and the cars on the sides were startled as they immediately jammed on the breaks. They nearly followed along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao felt fortunate that he wasn’t the one driving, since the police would definitely investigate it tomorrow. With a smile, he replied, “I’m sorry, but I don’t believe you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Rangure looked at Su Tao and blinked her eyes. Her eyes looked as if they could speak. Taking out a name card from her pocket, she handed it over. “This is my contact information, and you can contact me anytime if you’re interested in my suggestion. Then again, I won’t give up, and I will surely continue to bother you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By rights, being tangled by a seductress should be a fortunate matter. However, Su Tao innately felt danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you getting something wrong? You’re my hostage right now!” Su Tao received the name card. The front side of it was printed in Chinese, while the backside in English. Her position was the Acting Chairman of Pula Investment International’s Asia branch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao didn’t believe that her identity was that simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hostage? I’m only acting with you.” Rangure gave a provoking glance at Su Tao as she asked, “Do you believe that I can make you disappear anytime I want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t!” Su Tao said confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a cold arc rose on Rangure’s lips, she swiftly spun the steering wheel as she jammed on the clutch and gas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sedan, which was driving at high speed, suddenly started spinning and an ear-piercing friction resounded from the tires and left marks on the ground in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had underestimated Rangure’s insanity and felt his entire world spinning. Although he had a good physique, the sudden movement in such a secluded space made him feel dizzy. Subconsciously, he grabbed onto the handle above the window, but even so, his body was still being thrown to the left and right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along with it, Rangure’s chuckles resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao felt his scalp going numb and he realised that he had provoked a madwoman. After a brief pondering, he decided to let go of the handle and his body bumped against Rangure from the momentum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Rangure’s chuckles stopped. She did not expect that Su Tao would bump over. At this moment, she even panicked a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While holding onto Rangure’s waist, Su Tao placed his head against her waist to maintain his balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a soft sensation, as if he had entered a sea of cotton.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if he had found his harbour at this moment that was both thrilling and exciting at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, he tightened his embrace around Rangure’s waist, hoping to stop her insanity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rangure naturally realised that she had been taken advantage of, since there was an unusual sensation from her waist that made her feel her heart being squeezed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao naturally sensed Rangure’s reaction. He had purposely tapped on an acupoint on her waist. This was a hidden acupoint on the waist that could be used to promote hormone secretion, and it had an aphrodisiac effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he expected, Rangure’s lower limbs started to shudder and she knew that she had to shake this man, who was embracing her waist, off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few seconds later, she regained her rationale and jammed on the breaks. At the same time, she opened the door and kicked Su Tao out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao fell on the ground, he felt his entire world spinning and did not notice Rangure’s prideful glance when she left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief rest, he recovered his energy. He then took out Rangure’s name card and threw it into the rubbish bin after a brief pondering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To a woman that he couldn’t control, she was akin to a thorny rose, and he had to keep his distance.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Rangure drove back, her mood was in turmoil and she couldn’t help smiling as she reminisced the entire process. She found it pretty interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As an SUV drove in her direction turned on the flash, Rangure stopped by the roadside before entering the SUV. As for this Sedan, Bai Fan would pick it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rangure, I have to remind you that I will be in trouble if anything happens to you!” The foreign man complained in German.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kahn, I know your ambition. If anything happens to me, wouldn’t it be perfect for you to make another progress?” Rangure swept a glance at Kahn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kahn laughed to hide the truth and asked, “You’re familiar with China, and I’ve only been here for a few months. There are still many things that I have to learn from you! But I really don’t understand, why would you pay so much attention to a young man?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you understood, then you can replace my position now!” Rangure locked her brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For someone that knew nothing about the structure of China’s society, explaining anything to him would be playing the lute to a cow. Right now, Su Tao had more potential than Wang Guofeng since he had deep relations with two senior officials in China. Furthermore, he was also closer to becoming a National Physician than Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a seed that has potential!</span></p>
