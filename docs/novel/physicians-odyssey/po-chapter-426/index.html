 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was already 11:30 a.m. by the time they left Ivanov’s estate. Driving her H1 to a courtyard with simple tables and chairs laid out, Shui Junzuo called out to the owner, “Two sautéed pig trotters rice with more trotters!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man immediately acknowledged her order, went to prepare and served the two plates of rice a brief moment later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The trotters were placed on the fragrant rice before it was drenched in sauce. The hair was cleanly shaved and the egg was also permeating with aroma. Although this seemed to be a simple meal, &nbsp;it had an extraordinary taste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Su Tao did not have a habit of such greasy food, he still ate with gusto. When he raised his head, he handed a napkin over when he saw Shui Junzuo’s lips covered in the sauce. Shui Junzhuo also had no idea that her lips were covered in sauce and failed to clean herself well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh at this scene, Su Tao took the initiative to clean it up for her before smiling. “You’re really stupid!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao, Shui Junzhuo blushed and smiled. “What has this got to go with stupidity? I can’t see my own face, so how would I know where the spot is at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, you can see your own reflection from my pupils and use it as your mirror!” Su Tao teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shui Junzhuo’s gaze interacted with Su Tao, she instantly blushed, “How can I see so clearly with such a small reflection?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao liked to see Shui Junzhuo looking bashful and smiled. “So you really did try and look at your own reflection! See, you’re so easy to fool, so aren’t you stupid? It’s common sense that you won’t be able to see the sauce on your lips through the reflection in my pupils. Forget it, seeing that you’re so stupid, I’ll do it for you in the future, but we have to agree that you won’t mind it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mind what?” Shui Junzhuo was baffled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bechaze thish ish an intimate acshion, and I’m afwaid that you might think that I’m too frivoloush!” Su Tao’s speech was blurred due to the mouthful of rice in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. I’m a child of society, so I won’t be bothered about this.” Shui Junzhuo smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teased by her words, Su Tao nearly choked himself and gulped down a mouthful of water before he replied, “I never expected that you’re so humorous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I have a lot of merits!” Shui Junzhuo winked and smiled. “But you’ve not noticed them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao replied, “In the mindset of many, those who were born from noble families are like fairies out of the commoner’s reach. I never expected that you’re so down-to-earth and treat me to such a place filled with old Beijing’s atmosphere for a meal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo replied with a smile, “It’s all mainly their prejudice and they feel that those born in a noble family are a bunch of arrogant pricks. But in reality, most of them have received an excellent education, and their vision is wider and more responsible, but it is often just misled by the media.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao refuted, “It’s not because the media has misled everyone. Firstly, there truly are many amongst those people who are truly as described, since they hold more resources in their hands compared to others. So if they committed a crime, the level of their crime is usually more serious than ordinary criminals. Secondly, no matter how society develops, it’s normal for everyone to look at the rich like enemies while looking at the poor with compassion. This is the right view that serves as a motivation that pushes forth the development of society.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your logic are truly unusual!” Shui Junzhuo laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao carried on with his analysis, “The poor viewing the rich as enemies while commoners viewing officials as enemies; that is also their jealousy and envy. Despite calling the rich heartless, they still hope to be one of them. Becoming rich from poor or becoming an official from a commoner is their motivation as desires fuel the progress of society.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Actually, the rich also have their own share of troubles.” Shui Junzhuo sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao smiled. “I once saw a news report saying how people who earn ¥300,000 a year feel more stress than those who earn ¥30,000 annually. I feel that that’s the biggest joke in the world. Those who earn ¥300,000 can live in large houses, drive a decent car, and allow their kids to receive a better education. How can they feel more stressed than those who earn ¥2,500 a month? With how prices are depreciating, those who earn ¥2,500 can only afford to fill their stomachs every month. Living in a big house is a dream of theirs. They travel in public transport and only use a cab when absolutely necessary. Although their children are entitled to free education, tuition occupies an important portion of their pay. So who do you think feels more stressful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo fell into a brief silence before she smiled. “You have a chivalrous heart!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was really praising him, since he was only voicing his complaints. Rather than praising him for having a chivalrous heart, it was more suitable to call him a passionate youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao explained, “I’m only a physician!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to change the current society!” Shui Junzhuo commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief hesitation, Su Tao smiled. “Indeed, I do have such thoughts. A soldier that doesn’t want to get promoted is not a good soldier, and a physician that doesn’t want to treat the country isn’t a good physician.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo’s eyes radiated with splendor as her heart trembled. At this moment, it was as if she had a whole new perception of Su Tao; she never expected that Su Tao would have such a fire blazing in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the splendor in Shui Junzhuo’s eyes, Su Tao sought forgiveness in his heart as he was only going with the flow. He never expected that he would blow the trumpet so righteous, and at this moment, he couldn’t take his words back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, everyone has the ambition to conquer the world in their hearts, but most of them were just down-to-earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao felt that his earlier speech was too much, and he had no idea if Shui Junzhuo would look at him in disdain for boasting so shamelessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long silence, Shui Junzhuo pursed her lips together. “I believe that you can prove yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao smiled as he alleviated the situation before sighing at his heavens-defying flirting skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because he knew what sort of girl Shui Junzhuo was, so he would try to shape himself according to her preference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tiny physician that wants to change the country and the world was basically a pipe dream, but Shui Junzhuo believed in him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed. Shui Junzhuo was really stupid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at the same time, he also felt touched. Men had their vanity, and if there’s a woman who dares to believe in your insanity, how was she not a close friend?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao was truly moved by Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, he only considered her to be a beautiful and elegant woman, but at this moment, he had viewed her as someone whom he can interact with in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there anything on my face?” Shui Junzhuo misunderstood Su Tao’s gaze, thinking there was something on her face, which she wiped it a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without him knowing, Su Tao stared into Shui Junzhuo for ten-odd seconds before he immediately concealed the awkwardness, “Yeah, let me clean it for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he used his finger to rub the tip of Shui Junzhuo’s nose like a little kid before he burst into laughter, “You’re really stupid! You were fooled again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo’s emotions were all pent up and felt that her heart nearly leapt out of her chest. Although it was an action to humiliate her, she did not feel indignant about it. On the contrary, she felt sweetness instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t this… the legendary flirting?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She felt as if she was on a date with Su Tao, which she immediately dispelled the thought and warned herself that it wasn’t real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they left the courtyard, Shui Junzhuo led Su Tao on a stroll to the shopping mall. Perhaps it was due to her formal outfit looking incompatible when walking with Su Tao, but she bought a set of casual clothes. After trying out the clothes, she did not change it out. Instead, she placed her formal clothes into the bag.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She also did not refuse Su Tao’s offer to pay for her purchase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks for buying me a set of clothes!” Shui Junzhuo did not opt for branded goods. She was practically a natural clothes frame with her outstanding figure. Thus, she looked good in any clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, we’re fair now. You treated me to a meal while I bought you a set of clothes!” Su Tao sighed as Shui Junzhuo was intelligent, and she knew how to deal with things appropriately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Men were all about their dignity, so when a man offers to pay for you, remember not to refuse it as they will feel embarrassed instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo was a woman who plans and implements. After they finished their shopping, she brought Su Tao to Forbidden City, and it was already 1:30 p.m. by the time they arrive at their destination. They briefly went through the tour, since it would be closing in three hours. They entered by the southern gate and exited at the northern gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using his phone, Su Tao took quite a few photos for Shui Junzhuo. But when the latter offered to do the same for him, Su Tao refused it, giving a reason of him being too handsome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at the Gate of Divine Prowess, Su Tao stopped a middle-aged couple and handed his phone over to them, requesting them to take a photo for him and Shui Junzhuo together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao stood in position, Shui Junzhuo came to his side under the couple’s instruction before she gently held onto his arm. Su Tao felt a little nervous and he started to sweat as he slowly moved his face over, which Shui Junzhuo did the same as well. At this moment, their faces were only a few centimeters apart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Done!” The middle-aged man handed the phone back to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at the photo, Su Tao shook his head in dissatisfaction, which Shui Junzhuo curiously asked, “Let me have a look!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s forget about it!” Su Tao refused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way! I’m in the photo, and you have to show it to me! If it’s not up to satisfaction, then I have to delete it!” Shui Junzhuo was like any typical girl. She was incredibly serious about the quality of her photo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Su Tao gave in and handed his phone over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shui Junzhuo looked at it, she instantly started laughing incessantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it really that funny?” Su Tao was embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course!” Shui Junzhuo wiped the tears off the corner of her eyes and continued, “No wonder you’re not willing to take any photo, it’s because your expression is so stupid!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s smile was stiff in the photo as he made a peace sign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao wondered why he was nervous earlier when he was taking the photo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But then again, some people were just not suitable for photo-taking, which Su Tao reminded himself not to make another similar mistake in the future.</span></p>
