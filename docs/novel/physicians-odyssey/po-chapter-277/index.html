<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Huaibei Province’s He City. She Wei’s residence was lit with Cai Zhongpu brewing tea before he gave a cup to Cai Yan. Seeing the anxiety on his daughter’s face, Cai Zhongpu comforted, “Yan’er, you have already informed Yan Jing, and she should be able to help Su Tao with her influence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rejecting that cup of tea, Cai Yan sighed, “Dad, I want to make a trip to Sichuan! I can’t just wait and do nothing. He must have been framed, I have to help him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Zhongpu could see the deep attachment that his daughter had for Su Tao. But that wasn’t strange, since Su Tao was the one who gave a helping hand when they were facing difficulties. Now that Su Tao was in trouble, how could she do nothing and wait? Thus, Cai Zhongpu nodded his head after consideration. “Alright, I’ll go with you, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the father and daughter, She Wei sighed. Truth be told, she was also feeling anxious in her heart, since she had owed Su Tao a favor as well. However, she was calmer than the two and persuaded, “Don’t be too anxious. Firstly, the two of you know nothing about Sichuan, so would there be any use for the two of you to go there? Yan Jing surely has her arrangements. Su Tao is important to her, and she will definitely help him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Biting her lips, Cai Yan sighed, “Then, are we going to do nothing and wait?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Getting up from her seat, She Wei walked to Cai Yan. She held onto the latter’s hands and said, “Listen to me. Calm down and wait for news. I believe that it will be swiftly resolved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Squeezing out a smile, Cai Zhongpu consoled his daughter as well, “Su Tao is witty, so he won’t suffer. Not to mention his fighting skills and medical skills. It will be easier for him without us dragging his feet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Cai Yan could only loathe herself for being weak, and this incident has also planted a determination in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of this was because she was too weak, and she wouldn’t have been in this spot if she was powerful like Yan Jing. She felt an unprecedented urge to grow stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was mostly instinctual for humans to yearn for power and wealth. However, Cai Yan wanted to grow stronger for a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew that the man she fell for had a great ambition, and he would definitely shake the world in the future. Thus, she had to grow stronger so that she could be qualified to stand by his side.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shui Junzhuo received the news about Su Tao’s straits, she immediately booked the earliest flight from Qiongjin City. By the time she arrived at Rongzhou City, it was already 2 a.m. in the middle of the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Ah Jun went ahead, he arrived earlier, and he was waiting at the terminal to receive her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo’s face was haggard from the travel, but her brows were firm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where is he now?” Shui Junzhuo hurriedly walked over, she didn’t even bother taking her luggage. She only brought her red purse with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He was sent to the third prison in the province.” Ah Jun sighed with his brows locked together. “The other party is powerful, and they have used quite a bit of resources, which caught us by surprise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Prison?” Shui Junzhuo’s gaze flickered with uneasy as she asked, “What’s the reason?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He beat someone up while he was in custody.” Ah Jun sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In perplexion, Shui Junzhuo replied, “It’s unlikely for him to beat someone up with his temperament.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah Jun noticed that Shui Junzhuo was walking at a fast pace, which was indirectly speaking her anxiety. In his memories, the princess of the Shui Family was always calm and composed. Thus, he could tell how much Su Tao meant to Shui Junzhuo, and he instantly knew why the old man would want to let her know about this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The other party had set up a trap and arranged two local hoodlums to beat him up. In the end, Su Tao retaliated and knocked the two of them out.” Ah Jun knew the entire matter inside out, which proved the intelligence that the Shui Family held.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then why didn’t you interfere since you knew about it?” Shui Junzhuo questioned. It was unusual for her to be roused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief hesitation, Ah Jun reminded, “This isn’t Huainan, but Sichuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though there were forces of the Shui Family hidden here, it was best for them to maintain a low profile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Contact the Lin Family immediately!” In Sichuan, the Lin Family’s position was akin to the Shui Family in Huainan. Hence, Shui Junzhuo knew that she had to contact the Lin Family if she wanted to swiftly save Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The old man has already contacted the Lin Family, and it’s midnight now.” Ah Jun sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Contact them. We can cut Su Tao some suffering if we’re faster.” Shui Junzhuo gave a decisive instruction, already disregarding the basic etiquette.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Ah Jun left Qiongjin City, Sire Shui had instructed him to obey Shui Junzhuo’s orders. For him, orders were akin to an imperial decree, so he immediately contacted the Lin Family through some special connections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a call that woke many people up from their beauty sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Shui Family was influential enough, and as the direct granddaughter of Sire Shui, Shui Junzhuo was qualified to knock on the Lin Family’s door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lin Family was more luxurious than one would imagine. There was an entire mountain that acted as their garden, and due to Shui Junzhuo’s arrival, the Lin Family has sent out someone from the same generation to receive her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the living room, Shui Junzhuo did not touch the cup of tea and got right to the point, “Big Brother Fangbin, I will not beat around the bush. I came so late at night in the hope of saving a friend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting down the cup of tea, Lin Fangbin smiled. “Junzuo, it has been years since we last met. Your temper seems to have become irritable. I’m well aware of the entire situation, so how can I not help with the connection that our two families have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a breath in relief, Shui Junzhuo replied, “Thank you, Big Brother Fangbin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Lin Fangbin laughed, “I’m rather curious. Who is that Su Tao for him to make you so anxious about him?” Shui Junzhuo was famous in their circle, and if he were a few years younger, he would also try to pursue her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Lin Fangbin had agreed in such a straightforward manner, Shui Junzhuo also did not hide it from him, “He’s saved my grandfather’s life. Some time ago, my grandfather was down with an unusual illness, but he was the one who brought the miraculous cure to my grandfather.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Lin Fangbin was surprised as he exclaimed, “So it’s a doctor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Shui Junzhuo continued, “He’s also a kindhearted and righteous doctor. So he must have been framed for him to be in such straits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don't worry!” Lin Fangbin waved his hand and continued, “As long as he’s in Sichuan, I guarantee that nothing will come to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief hesitation, Shui Junzhuo asked, “Big Brother Fangbin, I’d like to go to the third prison and take him out now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Fangbin was left speechless by her words for a long time before he recovered and nodded his head with a sigh, “It looks like he’s not simply Sire Shui’s savior in your heart!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words instantly made Shui Junzhuo blush and her heart raced. Her initiative reflected her feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment someone falls in love, their character would undergo a drastic change. Even someone who’s usually reserved would occasionally act out of character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite knowing that her actions were somewhat unreasonable, she chose to disregard the view of others for that youth in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her heart fluttered. So what if she was admitting her feelings for Su Tao? She was never afraid of those secular gazes.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a tedious mountain journey from Rongzhou to Chenhe City. Even if the chauffeur had excellent skills, he did not dare to drive too quickly. By the time the vehicle reached Chenhe City, the morning sun had already lit the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Shui Junzhuo was anxious since many things could occur in a night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Fangbin saw the uneasiness in Shui Junzhuo, he was also surprised. Hence, he made a few calls to coordinate the matter in Chenhe City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news was soon sent to the third prison, and Captain Zheng was dumbfounded when he received the orders.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s going on? The Lin Family is concerned and will save that newcomer? They’re even sending over an authoritative figure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling uneasy, Captain Zheng started to worry and rejoice at the same time. He was rejoicing since Black Leather suffered acute gastroenteritis. Otherwise, he would surely be in trouble if Su Tao sustained any injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coming to the cell, the inmates were all maintaining a push-up posture on their beds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wide smile spread out on Captain Zheng’s face as he said, “Mr. Su Tao, I’ve just received word that you’re allowed to leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Captain Zheng’s words, the inmates instantly rejoiced in their hearts, since the perverse newcomer was finally leaving. If they continued with the push-ups, they would practically be drained of strength for half a year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What time is it now?” Su Tao analysed that Sire Shui must have used some connections. Otherwise, he would at least have to wait till tomorrow for any news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s 3 a.m. now!” Captain Zheng answered in a respectful voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s 3 a.m., and it’s still dark outside. Where do you want me to go?” Su Tao had no good impression of this prison officer. Although he had no idea if Black Leather was under this prison officer’s orders, he must be related.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can rest in our office. We will be arranging for your departure tomorrow morning.” Captain Zheng continued to persuade, “There are proper beds in the office, and the environment is better.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, but I still prefer this place.” Su Tao started putting on airs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a wry smile, Captain Zheng responded, “You’re making things hard for us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You finally realised it? Indeed, I’m making things hard for you on purpose!” Su Tao then closed his eyes and ignored Captain Zheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His reply made Captain Zheng anxious, since he had also realized that Su Tao was purposely making things difficult for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been a prison officer for ten-odd years, and encountering such an unreasonable prisoner was a first for him. Anyone else here would yearn for freedom, but Su Tao acted differently, as if he enjoyed staying here. When he looked at the faces of the other inmates, he suddenly knew that Su Tao was satisfied with being here. The inmates were all beaten to submission by him, and it was rare for Su Tao to find so many targets to vent his emotions on.</span></p>
