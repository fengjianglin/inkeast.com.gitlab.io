 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan whipped up four dishes; Stir-fried Spinach, Garlic Starch Jelly, Tomato Egg Soup, and Water Bamboo Shredded Pork. Seeing that there weren’t many meat dishes, Yan Sha felt a loss of appetite and ate the rice by itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knocking on her bowl, Jiang Qinghan said, “Eat vegetables! You’re always eating junk food and not eating any vegetables, be careful of turning into a fatty!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t like grass! It’s so hard to swallow it!” Yan Sha grumbled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Yan Sha used grass to call vegetables, Su Tao nearly spat the food in his mouth. He turned to Jiang Qinghan and smiled. “Yan Sha is still young, and her body is still growing. So it’s normal for her to take fancy in those unhealthy foods. When she notices that the food isn’t healthy one day, she will naturally change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s young?!” Yan Sha slammed the chopsticks on the table and left. “I’m full!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan’s expression turned furious seeing Yan Sha. She wanted to go over and reprimand her daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao immediately held onto Jiang Qinghan and said, “At this age, it’s natural for her to be rebellious. You have to guide a girl like her slowly or it will become even more severe instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, Yan Sha was already considered obedient, and Su Tao knew that he had hurt Yan Sha by calling her young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words to Jiang Qinghan was to protect Yan Sha. After all, she’s only sixteen, and in his heart, she’s like a sister to him. So it’s natural for him to protect and dote on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the meal was simple, Su Tao ate with gusto and ate two bowls of rice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao was so supportive, Jiang Qinghan gave him a bowl of soup, which Su Tao cleared it as well before helping Jiang Qinghan with cleaning up the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the kitchen, Su Tao washed the dishes and asked, “Is there any news about Zhao Yongde?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan’s expression turned grave as she wiped the stove with a rag. “Zhao Yongde is extremely cunning, We’ve searched the road cameras, and saw him disappear two streets after leaving the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Su Tao asked, “Was there anything missing from the morgue’s manager when he died?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you asking about that?” Jiang Qinghan pondered briefly before she added, “There’s nothing unusual. The manager’s handphone, wallet, and watch were still around!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then Zhao Yongde must have an accomplice!” Su Tao analysed with his brows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What makes you say that?” Jiang Qinghan stopped her work as she looked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Firstly, he had nothing on him when he escaped from the morgue. It’s hard to go anywhere without money, not to mention that he has to find someone to swiftly conceal his tracks.” Su Tao explained before asking, “Have you guys checked his history?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Jiang Qinghan responded, “His history is simple. He is an unemployed citizen, and he goes back to his hometown every year for a month or two. In this period, he never interacted with his neighbors or relatives, and there’s also nothing in his past that showed he has committed any crime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can tell that a criminal like him is experienced from the first glance. There’s another possibility being that his current identity is forged. You have to change your angle in investigating this matter by seeing if there are any other similar cases.” Su Tao analysed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan finally felt the foggy path clear up. It was no wonder why she didn’t manage to find any evidence so far. After washing her hands, she took her phone out and gave Zhang Zhen a call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chief, are there any instructions?” Zhang Zhen was still in the office working overtime while eating instant noodles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Run an immediate search to see if there are any cases similar to Zhao Yongde in the past five years.” After a brief pause, Jiang Qinghan emphasised, “Keywords: Tomb Robber Murder and Hospital Morgue Murder”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Zhen was briefly stunned by the abrupt request before he immediately understood the reason. “You’re saying that Zhao Yongde’s identity might be forged?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Jiang Qinghan added, “And he might have an accomplice. So be careful in the investigation. This person is extremely cunning and also an expert in hiding his tracks and murder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Zhen nodded his head with a solemn expression as he replied, “I’ll immediately gather a team to investigate. I’ll notify you if I find anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jiang Qinghan hung up the call, she turned to Su Tao and smiled, “I never expected that your thoughts would be so meticulous. If it wasn’t for the problematic structure in the police station, I might even want to make you an officer at all costs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was briefly stunned by her words and smiled. “Forget it, I don’t have that high of an enlightenment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving her hand, Jiang Qinghan shoved her way into the basin and pushed Su Tao away. “I’m just joking with you. Your medical skills are excellent, and it’s a waste of your talent to be a police officer. Go and take a rest in the living room, I’ll handle the dishes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao could feel the soft sensation when Jiang Qinghan bumped him with her arm. Feeling the excitement in his heart, he shook his head. “I’ll stay here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Jiang Qinghan was baffled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To chat with you so that it won’t be that boring.” Su Tao chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t need your company!” Jiang Qinghan sourly snorted. “I’m currently thinking about a case, and you’ll disrupt my trail of thoughts by talking to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that Jiang Qinghan said that on purpose, so he leaned against the wall. “Master, I find you pretty admirable. After all, not many people would be as focused and hard-working as you. But at the same time, it’s not good for you to be like this all the time. We need to occasionally relax and enjoy life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning around, Jiang Qinghan glared at Su Tao before she sourly replied, “What is a child like you doing trying to act mature and poke into the matters of an adult for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao knew why Yan Sha was so furious earlier. He was speechless at this moment. In his eyes, Yan Sha was a kid, while he was a kid in Jiang Qinghan’s eyes…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He initially thought that there’s a trace of restraint between the two of them, but looking at it now, it was just his misunderstanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Jiang Qinghan humming a tune as she washed the dishes, Su Tao sighed and came to the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin was currently watching a drama channel. He called Su Tao over to watch it together. However, Su Tao briefly accompanied the old man before he made up his mind to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when he passed by the kitchen, he could hear Jiang Qinghan softly talking over the phone with an unusual expression. Although he did not manage to eavesdrop, his first reaction was that this was a call from a man, and this was not work-related!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, his heart was sent into turmoil. Could it be that Jiang Qinghan was dating someone?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Jiang Qinghan was an adult, and she had her own freedom of choice, Su Tao still felt jealousy and frustrated. He drove his car to the alley and turned it behind a few trees, hiding in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly ten-odd minutes later, he saw Jiang Qinghan walking out and she had changed her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her hair was draped over her shoulders and she wore a blue jacket with a white shirt inside. She did not button the two highest buttons, which revealed her fair neck and her shirt propped her ample chest, which looked to be on the verge of bursting out. She also wore tight casual pants and a pair of heels that stood at seven centimeters, looking fashionable. At this moment, she looked nothing like her usual self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was far away, Su Tao could clearly see that she had even put on light makeup and lipstick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She’s definitely going to meet her lover!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao felt disturbed by this fact while curious about who she was meeting. After all, her dressing in this manner meant that the person she’s meeting had some importance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan had booked a cab over her phone, so Su Tao waited for the car to disappear before he slowly drove out and followed that car from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he had a feeling that he was catching adultery. He knew that his actions were a little wretched, but he still couldn’t restrain the curiosity in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cab drove quickly, but Su Tao did not dare to follow too closely behind. After all, Jiang Qinghan was a police officer, and she’s sensitive to her surroundings. Hence, he eventually lost the car after three traffic lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Su Tao felt depressed, he suddenly saw a car driving out from a path, which he fixed his gaze at the plate number.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t that the cab that Jiang Qinghan flagged earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He instantly grew ecstatic and knew that he would be able to find Jiang Qinghan by going down this path. In order to prevent himself from being discovered, Su Tao turned off the headlights. But after driving down a dozen meters through the path, he realised that it was too dark and the road wasn’t in good condition. Hence, he stopped the car and searched on foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly seven to eight minutes of walking, he saw a light from the distance, just when he couldn’t find Jiang Qinghan. Hence, he swiftly walked over and saw a black car parked by the dam. The lights were turned on along with the car bouncing up and down. Furthermore, he could hear the heavy breathing of a man and woman coming from the car.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He instantly felt his heart being squeezed. What’s this outrageous couple doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief hesitation, he ultimately mustered his courage and walked over. When he knocked on the car’s window, the movement inside the car instantly stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Open the door!” Su Tao ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the door did not open, but the window slowly wound down. Su Tao saw a couple naked with the woman above, who was startled by his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That man was bald. When he saw that it wasn’t someone he recognised, he immediately hollered, “Who the hell are you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Examining the man and woman, they looked to be in their forties with their faces slightly sagging, and that woman wasn’t Jiang Qinghan. He instantly felt his scalp going numb as he took a few steps back. “I’m sorry, I found the wrong person. You can carry on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bloody hell, are you insane?!” The man roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite feeling awkward, Su Tao also inwardly rejoiced. It was good that he got the wrong person and the woman wasn’t Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he knew that Jiang Qinghan must be close by. Hence, he continued his search before finding a gorgeous figure standing by the path by the river with the moonlight shining on her — it was Jiang Qinghan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing by the river dike was Xu Rui, who has been pestering Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qinghan, thank you for coming to see me one final time.” Xu Rui unzipped his chest and revealed the explosive device strapped to his waist as he continued, “Now, I can finally leave this world!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan was helpless as she said, “Xu Rui, there are always setbacks in life. Although you’ve encountered a difficulty, I believe that you can stand back up from where you have fallen, and you will be able to find your way in life. Giving up on life is unwise because only cowards resort to that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to persuade me.” Xu Rui wryly smiled. “My son is in prison, and I’ve lost my company along with having a huge debt. I am no longer compatible to you, but I’m gratified that you can come and meet me. So it turns out that my love for you wasn’t in vain!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Xu Rui wouldn’t budge no matter how she persuaded, she gnashed her teeth and lied, “Xu Rui, get down, now. As long as you don’t do anything foolish, I’m willing to get through this difficulty together with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” Hearing Jiang Qinghan’s words, Xu Rui hesitated.</span></p>
