<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the three days that Song Sichen conducted his charity consultation in Hanzhou City, it was extremely popular and even allowed the Three Flavour Hall to profit greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Sichen’s examination was swift, and he also swiftly gave out his prescriptions. Even the patients he attended had amounted to 300 a day, and it was a speed that even Su Tao would find difficulty matching. Due to Song Sichen’s vast experience in medicinal practice, consultations were just like eating a meal or other daily duties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why the Three Flavour Hall profited greatly was due to the sheer number of patients buying medicine. In the three days that Song Sichen was active in the charity consultation, the herbs in Three Flavour Hall was emptied with a gross profit of roughly ¥3,000,000, and it was the value of a divine physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His reputation as a divine physician wasn’t for naught. Song Sichen could detect any illness with a glance, and even his prescriptions were targeted at the illnesses. His prescriptions would generally take effect with one dose and it was a feat unachievable by ordinary physicians.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being in the Three Flavour Hall, Song Sichen also had a different sensation, since the workers here were all young with high efficiency. In general pharmacies, their pace would usually be slow, so he felt the urge to increase his speed and challenge his limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the three days that he was in the Three Flavour Hall, Song Sichen had also gained a better understanding of Su Tao. He noticed Su Tao’s charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strictly speaking, Su Tao cannot be considered a good man, since he was crafty and also business-minded. But anyone who shoulders the banner of TCM cannot be a good man, and it was precisely so that Su Tao was needed for his methods. Furthermore, the respect that Su Tao had for TCM from the bottom of his heart was touching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not knowing that Dou Fanggang was jealous, he also requested to host a charity consultation in the Three Flavour Hall when it heard about it. After a brief pondering, Su Tao felt that he could make use of this to promote the Three Flavour Hall’s branch in He City, which was scheduled to open in less than a month. After telling Dou Fanggang about his thoughts, the latter immediately agreed and proclaimed that he would do an excellent job for the Three Flavour Hall’s branch in He City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards Song Sichen and Dou Fanggang, Su Tao was filled with respect for the two veterans. The two seniors were genuinely trying to help him from the bottom of their hearts, and it was fortunate for TCM that they could have seniors like them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days before the International Medical Summit, which would be hosted in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, Su Tao also received an invitation from Park Joong-sun. The latter’s wedding would be hosted two days before the summit, so Su Tao decided not to go together with China’s representative team and meet up with them in Seoul instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What left Su Tao surprised was that Liu Ruochen called him and asked when he was moving out. As a representative of TCM, Liu Ruochen was naturally invited for the International Medical Summit, so this beauty has decided to meet up with Su Tao at Qiongjin City to head for Seoul together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he required a passport to leave the country, it was approved within a week with Liu Ruochen’s help. At the same time, it had also received South Korea’s Visa, which quickly showed the efficiency of Liu Ruochen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he reached the airport, he saw Liu Ruochen donned in a white dress and sunglasses standing amongst the crowd. When she saw Su Tao, she removed her sunglasses to reveal her big pearly eyes with black hair draped on her shoulders. She looked exceptionally fashionable compared to usual, and she looked like a lady barely in her twenties. As for her clothing, it gave her the temperament of an older sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry to keep you waiting.” Su Tao walked over with smiles as he spread his hands out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Liu Ruochen did not give him this opportunity and took half a step back, then smiled. “There’s still about an hour before the plane takes off, and I was the one that came early.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Awkwardly retracting his arms, Su Tao looked nervous as he adjusted his collar. “I’m a little nervous about leaving the country for the first time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile on her face, Liu Ruochen replied, “I’ve gone to Seoul a few times, so you won’t lose your way if you follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roger! I will stick to you like an ointment plaster.” Su Tao showed a bright smile as he pulled his luggage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun caused by his words, Liu Ruochen sourly rolled her eyes. “Be more serious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Liu Ruochen’s figure, he wouldn’t be a normal man if he could be serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a big sister like Liu Ruochen around, there were many things that Su Tao didn’t have to vex about. This was also the reason why he liked to mix around with those older than him. All of them were practically experienced, and they would be gentle when treating someone younger than them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Liu Ruochen would probably send Su Tao flying with a kick if she knew that he had such filthy thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had once imagined how the air-stewardess of the South Korea airlines would look like, and just as he had expected, all of them practically looked the same. In South Korea, plastic surgery was the norm. In their opinion, not only could plastic surgery make them more confident, but it could also allow them to receive the respect of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whole journey took roughly six hours, and it was already 7 p.m. by the time they arrived in South Korea. When Su Tao and Liu Ruochen walked out, they saw someone with name cards picking them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like my guide isn’t needed.” Liu Ruochen glanced at Su Tao in surprise, she never expected that the latter would know someone in South Korea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, you’ve benefited because of me.” Su Tao purposely gave of a prideful look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone heard their conversation, they would think that the two of them were flirting. Even Liu Ruochen had no idea why she would be swept into this maelstrom. Naturally, she also hadn’t noticed that she would wear a smile by habit when talking with Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one who came to pick them up was a South Korean woman, with the standard appearance of a white-collared woman in dramas. Her hair was dyed brown with contact lenses. She had thick makeup, beige stockings, and 17-centimeter heels. When she saw Su Tao, she first made an introduction of herself with her half-baked mandarin, “Mr. Su, nice to meet you. I’m acting on Delegate Park as your guide, and my name is Jang Ha-na.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a year ago, Park Joong-sun was still a Department Chief, but he had now become a Delegate. Su Tao felt that the former was pretty lucky, and it could be considered a fortune after a disaster. Not only did he get himself a beauty, but his position has also risen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Su Tao introduced, “This is my friend, Liu Ruochen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nice to meet you!” Jang Ha-na nodded her head. South Koreans have a set of etiquettes, and it was easy for others to gain a favorable opinion of them. “We will go to the carpark now, and I’ll send the two of you to the hotel. Delegate Park has already been waiting to have a meal with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, I’ll have to trouble you.” Su Tao replied with modesty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took roughly two hours from the airport to the hotel district. Seoul had two airports, the Gimpo International Airport and Incheon International Airport. After the Incheon International Airport was being used, the Gimpo International Airport was changed into Gimpo Domestic Airport. The Incheon International Airport was located in Yeongjongdo, which was an artificially reclaimed land. So by the time they arrived at the hotel, it was already 10 p.m.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao and Liu Ruochen in puzzlement, Jong Ha-na asked, “How many rooms do the two of you need?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ask Ruochen that question!” smiled Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two!” Liu Ruochen glared at Su Tao. She realised that Su Tao was more of a hoodlum than she imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because this hotel was an asset under the SG Chaebol, Jong Ha-na swiftly got the procedures done. When Su Tao walked into the room, he realised that Park Joong-sun has given him a high treatment; it was a luxurious room that was only inferior to the presidential suite. Hotels in South Korea were extremely developed in both its hardware and software. They even surpassed a few official standards of hotels in China. Thus, this luxurious room was comparable to the deluxe suite in a five-starred hotel in China.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After some simple sorting of his luggage, Jong Ha-na seemed to have calculated the time, since she pressed the bell to his room. Upon seeing Jong Ha-na hesitating in her words when he opened the door, Su Tao enquired with a smile, “Is there anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mustering her courage, Jong Ha-na asked, “I heard that you’re a doctor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I’m a physician.” Su Tao knew that Jong Ha-na probably had a request for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he had expected, Jong Ha-na requested, “May I take some of your time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to seek my help?” smiled Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Jong Ha-na nodded her head heavily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I usually charge a fee for my patients.” Su Tao said purposely, and when he saw the astonishment in Jong Ha-na’s eyes, he continued, “But we can forget about that as a meeting gift. I’ll treat you for free.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a breath of relief, Jong Ha-na bashfully smiled. “Physician Su, you’re too humorous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, Su Tao had already noticed that Jong Ha-na was suffering from Chill Womb when they were in the vehicle. In light cases, it would cause irregular menstruations and infertility in serious cases. If they did not pay attention to their health, they might also experience painful menstruation or missing menstruation cycle, that was the typical symptoms of Chill Womb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve been married for two years, but you’re getting anxious since you’re not getting pregnant, am I right?” Su Tao slowly opened up his medical box and asked with a smile while taking out his belt of needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Jong Ha-na’s face blushed with astonishment. She never mentioned it, so how did Su Tao know that she has been married for two years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao did not provide any further explanation. From the diamond ring on Jong Ha-na’s finger, he could tell that she was already married.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One can analyse the lifestyle of others from their physiological state, and he could tell if a couple was having a high frequency of an intimate lifestyle with a single glance. Not to mention that Jong Ha-na was hesitating with shyness at her request, which made him speculate that it might have something to do with pregnancy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please remove your upper clothes.” Su Tao requested without any impurities in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Jong Ha-na was more extrovert, she still hesitated to remove her clothes before a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she removed her jacket, Su Tao immediately stopped her when she was about to remove her shirt underneath, “That will do. Please lie down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite her nervousness, Jong Ha-na still laid down on the couch in the living room. When Su Tao bent down and gently pulled up the shirt covering her lower abdomen, the bell suddenly rang. Jong Ha-na instantly grew nervous. If anyone saw this scenario, how great of a misunderstanding would it be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao stopped what he was doing and opened the door. Seeing Liu Ruochen, who changed into a new set of clothing, he smiled. “You came at a great time. I was treating Ha-na, and you’re also an expert in the field of gynecology. Why don’t you take over?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Ruochen saw Jong Ha-na lying on the couch, she smiled. Su Tao was truly not bothered. If it was someone else in her position, they might misunderstand if he was doing anything to this woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She smiled. “How can I take over your patient?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrugging his shoulders, Su Tao felt that Liu Ruochen’s words sounded somewhat sour. He smiled and walked to Jong Ha-na. Seeing her nervousness, Su Tao explained, “Ruochen is also a physician, and she’s an expert in gynecology. You can be reassured with her watching from the sidelines.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jong Ha-na looked at Su Tao’s gaze, she sighed and knew that she was overthinking it. How could such bright eyes without any impurities have ill intentions?</span></p>
