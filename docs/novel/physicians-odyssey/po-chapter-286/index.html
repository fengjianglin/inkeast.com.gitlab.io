 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hans was already dead when he was found. He was shot, and we suspect that it was an internal execution by his organisation.” Shui Junzhuo told Su Tao while sitting in the front passenger seat after receiving the news from Lin Fangbin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company?” Su Tao had no compassion for someone like Hans, since he was a person who rid himself of his humanity. Thinking of how he nearly murdered Miao Yugen, Su Tao knew that he was a homicidal maniac. So as long as he’s alive in the world, then there would be more people hurt by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re concerned about the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company’s underground research facilities?” Shui Junzhuo smiled as she continued, “Don’t worry. My grandfather has already arranged for someone to investigate them. I believe that in two months, we will uncover all the branches and everyone involved.” Her grandfather was determined!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a breath, he knew that Jiang Qinghan would surely rejoice if she learned of this news. After all, she has been following this case for a few years and was even in danger several times because of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sending Jiang Qinghan a message, Su Tao soon received her reply, “I have already been informed of this news, and the organisation has put me into a small investigation team on the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company. Thank you, Su Tao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although her message was simple, Su Tao could feel her sincerity. If it wasn’t for Su Tao getting involved in this matter, the higher-ups wouldn’t have paid so much attention to this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a criminal police, it was tough for Jiang Qinghan to topple the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company by herself. So if the higher-ups did not pay attention to it, she couldn't resolve this by herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan had a deep grudge with this case, since the death of her husband was related to this case. Hence, she did not do it entirely for justice, but she was also doing it for her own obsession. Perhaps when she completely resolves this case, would she be able to face her own life and start a new beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Jiang Qinghan might look normal, she was actually living in her own world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you messaging?” asked Shui Junzhuo as she bumped Su Tao with her elbow. Even if she knew that it was Su Tao’s privacy and she shouldn’t ask about it, she couldn’t help herself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Women, they’re always curious cats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My Master!” Su Tao did not hide it from Shui Junzhuo, since it was also thanks to her help that the matters with the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company could be resolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Su Tao shared the story of Jiang Qinghan to Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected that there’s such a woman in the world.” Shui Junzhuo’s tone was filled with admiration. Any woman would be touched upon hearing Jiang Qinghan’s story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao smiled. “That’s why I immediately told her about this news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did you take her as your Master, then?” Shui Junzhuo was curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s another story.” Thus, Su Tao told her the story about how Yan Wujin accepted him as a disciple on behalf of his daughter-in-law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were some wuxia elements to the story that seemed like a novel, Shui Junzhuo was extremely focused on the story. After all, the difference in the actual underworld and her imagination was too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao finished his story, it was already time to board the plane. It takes roughly two hours to go from Sichuan Province to Minnan Province. Shui Junzhuo was seated at the window seat with her eyes covered. She had been traveling for the past few days and suffered quite a bit. Seeing that she was in sweet dreams, Su Tao asked for a blanket from the air-stewardess and covered her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours passed in the blink of an eye, and when Su Tao turned on his phone, he received a few messages, with Lu Shimiao calling him a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Su Tao returned a call, which was soon responded by Lu Shimiao’s grumbling, “Why did you turn off your phone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Su Tao explained, “I just boarded the plane, so I had to turn my phone off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Plane? Where are you right now?” Lu Shimiao never expected that Su Tao’s schedule would be so full. She initially wanted to meet up with him in Sichuan Province.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Minnan Province. I’m going to meet a special patient later.” Su Tao knew that Lu Shimiao would definitely rush to Baitan Town to discuss Golden Chicken Mountain and continued, “Look for someone called Leng Yuan. He will pull the strings for the contract.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hanging up the phone, Lu Shimiao sighed. She was a little disappointed. She suddenly felt that she didn’t understand Su Tao. Although this man would occasionally show the temper of a boy, he was steady deep down in his bones. He wasn’t someone who idled and would often travel around. Even his every action would hold an objective with high efficiency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After briefly adjusting her mood, Lu Shimiao took her luggage and headed for the counter. At the very least, she had to follow Su Tao’s footsteps.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Minnan Province was located in the southeast of China, in which Taiwan was in clear sight. The atmosphere in this province was warmer. So despite being in the winter season, the temperature was around 15°C.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the plane touched the ground, a green jeep was parked to the side. Su Tao, Shui Junzhuo, and Ah Jun were led by an air-stewardess to leave the plane first for the jeep. Everyone in the cabin was surprised at this scene and they started to speculate the identity of those three who just sat on the same plane as them. As for the air-stewardess that gave Su Tao the blanket, she was also feeling regret. If she managed to obtain the contact details of that young man earlier, she would’ve soared in life.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The residence of the Cao Family wasn’t a majestic manor, but a simple one. Even the decorations were old-fashioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a smile, Shui Junzhuo explained, “This is an old building. Although it doesn’t seem remarkable, it has a deep foundation. There aren’t many people living in it now. A few years ago, Grandpa Cao was arranged in a new residence, but he didn’t like it and moved back a few days later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, this gave Su Tao another understanding of Cao Dingjun’s character. For a physician, it was important to know the character of your patient, since different people would require a different treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before they even entered the door, two people walked out. It was a middle-aged man in his forties with gold-framed glasses with handsome features. The other person looked to be in his sixties, dressed in a suit. He had a height of 5’7” with regret and helplessness on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man apologised, “Divine Doctor Xua, I’m really sorry about that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man in his sixties immediately waved his hand. “It’s nothing for me to suffer a little. But Mr. Cao has to be treated, or it will go out of control.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Shui Junzhuo, the middle-aged man waved his hand. “Junzhuo, you’re here? This is Old Xia, a specialist from the national healthcare team.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Dechun also wore a smile as he nodded towards Shui Junzhuo. He knew that anyone the Cao Family would take the initiative to greet wouldn’t be simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is Sire Shui’s granddaughter.” The middle-aged man whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Dechun was immediately enlightened as he asked, “I wonder how has Sire Shui’s health been recently?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My grandfather is in good shape, and he even made a trip to visit Grandpa Cao a few days ago.” Shui Junzhuo smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the elderly could travel far, that meant that Sire Shui must be in good health. Xia Dechun also heard that Sire Shui was suffering from a loss of speech, and was treated by a young physician. Hence, his gaze fell onto Su Tao and instantly knew that it’s most likely this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…?” The middle-aged man asked with a smile as he looked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Cao, this is Su Tao!” Shui Junzhuo immediately introduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao, Cao Huaiqing was surprised and sighed. He never expected that Sire Shui would arrange for such a young doctor over. Although he believed in Sire Shui, Su Tao only looked to be in his early twenties. Even an esteemed national doctor like Xia Dechun failed to convince his father to receive treatment. So how could this brat change the mindset of his father?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since there are guests, then I’ll take my leave first.” Xia Dechun cupped his hands as he helplessly started to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was also curious if Su Tao was capable of getting Cao Dingjun to receive treatment, it would be awkward for him to stay in the Cao Family with his status. Thus, he bade his farewell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Divine Doctor Xia, don’t be in such a rush. Since you’re here, why don’t you stay behind and think together?” The reason why Cao Huaiqing said that was due to his lack of confidence for Su Tao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief hesitation, Xia Dechun thickened his face and stayed. He naturally knew Cao Huaiqing’s thoughts, and he was also curious about whether Su Tao was competent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s name had already spread out in his circle and was known as a great talent in a thousand years by Song Sichen and Dou Fanggang. Thus, he wanted to witness and see if Su Tao was worthy of his fame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Cao Family’s villa wasn’t huge, it was just roughly three to four hundred square meters. Before they even entered, they could hear a roar, “Why are you guys always finding me a doctor?! I don’t believe in that nonsense, and I know my body. I can maintain good health by practicing martial arts daily…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Huaiqing immediately turned around and glanced at Xia Dechun. He could see the latter wearing an embarrassed expression and gave a hand sign to state that he would be waiting in the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Huaiqing also didn’t feel anything wrong about that. If the old man saw Xia Dechun, he would probably lose his temper again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he waved his hand and signaled for Su Tao to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon entering, Su Tao saw an old man with a long beard and donned in martial arts outfit. His complexion was a little yellow and he was venting his anger on a middle-aged woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately, he turned around and left!</span></p>
