<p> <strong><a href="/novel/physicians-odyssey/">Physician’s Odyssey</a></strong></p>
<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t the first time Su Tao performed treatment before Liu Ruochen. Truthfully speaking, Su Tao was nervous and excited every single time he exhibited his ability to this woman who shared the same ideals as him. It was the same as him flexing his biceps to impress the girls. Although he’s a divine physician, Su Tao was also an ordinary man. Thus, it was no surprise for him to have some interest in vanity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Liu Ruochen not see through Su Tao’s thoughts? She knew that this fellow was trying to put on a display before her, and by displaying a brilliant technique, wasn’t that directly telling her that he was unrivaled when it comes to acupuncture?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the first few acupoints that Su Tao chose left Liu Ruochen somewhat surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhongwan Acupoint on the lower abdomen was often used to treat Chill Womb, but Su Tao has chosen the Dantian and a few acupoints around it. Those acupoints weren’t used in the traditional acupuncturing technique, since they belonged to the eight extraordinary meridians. It was an often route used by martial artists to circulate their Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Su Tao circulated his Qi in his acupuncture for two cycles, Liu Ruochen then figured out what Su Tao was trying to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many reasons for Chill Womb. Some were innate, and some weren’t. For those who weren’t, they could be treated with the few acupoints like the Zhongwan and Shenque Acupoints. But for those innate, using those acupoints might be useful, but it wasn’t a solution to treat the root. It was only possible to allow the patient to be pregnant within a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, Su Tao wasn’t just trying to treat the symptoms, but he was trying to resolve her innate Chill Womb once and for all. Thus, he opted to use the eight extraordinary meridians to reform her physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Acupuncture would often have a set of techniques, but many times, the physicians couldn’t use them step-by-step. Watching Su Tao’s performance, Liu Ruochen sighed, since the former’s technique has reached a whole new realm. It was extraordinary, and he could declare a school for himself as a grandmaster with just his techniques alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao had no idea what was going on with Liu Ruochen’s thoughts. He was entirely focused on the acupuncture. He could sense that his skills have risen to a new level, and the technique that he was using to treat Jong Ha-na was an inspiration he gained from the Imperial Physician Scripture. But in this technique, he added some of his comprehension. Thus, it could be considered Su Tao’s unique technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, Jong Ha-na felt her lower abdomen swelling before she released a gas that filled the air with a foul stench.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She actually farted!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Jong Ha-na’s face blushed and she wanted to hide her face in a hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she heard Su Tao’s voice as he smiled, “One channel clear to a hundred through. I have treated your Chill Womb condition, so you just have to pay attention to nurse your health. I will give you a prescription to nurture your womb, you just have to take one dose a day. It will be effective within two months.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jong Ha-na stood up, she felt her body lighten up. Her menstruation would come knocking in a few days, and the swelling pain in her lower abdomen has disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, she immediately thanked, “Physician Su, thank you. You’re a divine physician, just as rumored.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Su Tao was briefly stunned before he smiled. “This is my first time coming to South Korea. Can it be that you’ve heard of me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting on her clothes, Jong Ha-na was emotional as she replied, “You must be unaware of it. You’re not just a hot topic in the upper circle of South Korea because of treating Ms. Choi Beom-gyu and Delegate Park Joong-sun. You even matchmade the two of them.” Many people wanted to seek treatment from Su Tao, and she never expected that she would be his first patient in South Korea. Just the thought of it made her somewhat excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, that’s the case!” Su Tao was a little embarrassed as he continued, “I’m actually a low-profiled person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the stars in Jong Ha-na’s eyes, Liu Ruochen sighed. She knew that Su Tao had gotten himself another fangirl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had spent some time in treating Jong Ha-na, it had completely changed her attitude toward him. After she carefully placed the prescription in her purse, she brought the two of them to the restaurant on the second floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because it was late, the restaurant was empty. When Park Joong-sun saw Su Tao, he immediately went over with a smile. “Mr. Su Tao, welcome to Seoul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Park Joong-sun was about to take over the operation in China, he brushed up on his mandarin in this period of time. Although it sounded a little awkward, Su Tao could sense the sincerity in his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Choi Beom-gyu was seated beside Park Joong-sun. Su Tao introduced, “This is my friend, Liu Ruochen. She’s also a physician.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Welcome! Welcome!” Park Joong-sun pulled out a chair in a gentlemanly manner for Liu Ruochen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the four of them sat, the waiters swiftly served the dishes. Evidently, they were exquisitely prepared traditional Korean dishes, such as Seafood Hotpot, Bibimbap, and Korean Barbeque. It was somewhat simple compared to Chinese dishes, but this was the highest standard for South Koreans to receive their guests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his cup, Su Tao smiled. “I have to congratulate Delegate Park for becoming a father soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Park Joong-sun was briefly stunned at those words, since they only received the news two days ago. But knowing that Su Tao was a divine physician, he wasn’t surprised and smiled. “Thank you, Divine Physician Su, for your best wishes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile still on his face, Su Tao took the initiative, “I’ll give you a prescription for pregnancy later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Park Joong-sun was impressed by Su Tao’s ability to understand others. Although he knew that his fiancée was pregnant, there was a high risk of miscarriage from the various statistics. Just a moment ago, he was still discussing with Choi Beom-gyu if they should request a prescription from Su Tao. However, he never expected that Su Tao would take the initiative to offer it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Divine Physician Su, you’re truly formidable!” Park Joong-sun felt grateful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a modest smile, Su Tao replied, “It’s just a skill to seek a living through meals. Just like how your management ability is unrivaled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Su Tao’s words, Park Joong-sun immediately felt prideful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Ruochen saw how Su Tao skillfully handled this meal and won over the South Korean party, she sighed in exclamation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the eyes of others, Su Tao’s action might be seem bossy and domineering, but only those that understood him knew that he was just someone skilled at putting on an act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He would return respect upon receiving it. On the contrary, he would retaliate if someone touched his bottom line. Su Tao lived a life wearing his heart on his sleeve. It was this free and easy lifestyle that made others hopeful of his future.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the hotel was a black vehicle and a woman in heavy makeup. Her gaze was on the screen that displayed Su Tao, Park Joong-sun, Choi Beom-gyu, and Liu Ruochen having their meal. That woman’s eyes were filled with hatred as she cursed, “Oppa, I will take vengeance for you!” That woman was Lee Jun-hyuk’s sister, Lee Jun-na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Missy, everyone is prepared, we can start the plan anytime.” A man in a black suit said from the front seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s start it, then!” Lee Jun-na gave out an order as she coldly looked at the screen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the man in the front seat gave out orders through the walkie-talkie, a man that was 5’6” charged into the room on the screen.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chang-suk Oppa, what are you doing here?” Choi Beom-gyu was surprised upon seeing that man and exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sim Chang-suk was furious as he pointed at Choi Beom-gyu. “Why did you lie to me? Why did you marry another man?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Park Joong-sun naturally knew the relationship between Choi Beom-gyu and Sim Chang-suk, so he said, “Chang-suk, I know that you’re in love with Beom-gyu, but she has only treated you like an older brother. The reason why we didn’t want to tell you about our marriage was that you were still in the military service. We’re afraid that you would be hurt upon receiving the news, so we decided to hide it from you until you’re done with the military service.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Sim Chang-suk replied, “Beom-gyu, you can’t do this to me. You can’t change your heart so easily. You’re not allowed to marry Park Joong-sun, and if you’re not willing to listen to me, then I can only take drastic measures!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished speaking, Sim Chang-suk pulled open his clothes and revealed the explosive on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Park Joong-sun let out a sigh. He did not expect that this would occur. By rights, Sim Chang-suk should still be in the military service, so there could only be one reason for him to show up here; he deserted the army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Choi Beom-gyu has once told him that Sim Chang-suk was infuriated with her, but Park Joong-sun never expected that he would be so dramatic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he tried to persuade, “Chang-suk, calm down. Are you going to harm Beom-gyu?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I can’t be together with her, then I would rather die together with all of you!” Sim Chang-suk maniacally roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao and Liu Ruochen exchanged a look. They could guess the situation even if they had no idea what they were talking about. This man armed with explosives should be trying to suicide together with Park Joong-sun and Choi Beom-gyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outside had already been alerted to this situation and a few security guards stood a distance away. They did not dare to approach out of fear that they might provoke Sim Chang-suk. Although Sim Chang-suk did not have a tall build, he was muscular and was a well-trained fighter in the military. Thus, ordinary people couldn't get close to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With tears welling up in her eyes, Choi Beom-gyu sobbed, “Chang-suk Oppa, don’t do this. I beg you, don’t do this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Sim Chang-suk had ignored her words and waved his hand. “Beom-gyu, why did you lie to me?! Didn’t you promise to marry me? How can you do this to me?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Violently shaking her head, Choi Beom-gyu responded, “I’ve never promised to marry you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a cold sneer, Sim Chang-suk pulled out the trigger from his pocket. It was the detonator to the explosive, and the explosive he had on him could even destroy this entire building. The moment he pressed the red button, everything would be reduced to ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Liu Ruochen felt a cold wind blow past and she subconsciously glanced at Su Tao. She noticed that he had already charged a few meters out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sim Chang-suk did not expect that someone would charge at him, and by the time he reacted, Su Tao was only roughly three meters away from him. Gritting his teeth, he tried to press on the button, but he realised that his upper body had turned stiff and he couldn’t move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subconsciously looking at his chest, he saw a silver chopstick plunged into his chest before he fell backwards.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plan failed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lee Jun-na saw this scene in the car, she roared in anger, while trying her best to control her emotions. She was biting on her lips with blood flowing down.</span></p>
