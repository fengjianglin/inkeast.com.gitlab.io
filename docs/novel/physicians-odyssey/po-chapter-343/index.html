 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Cai Yan arranged all the required documents, Su Tao stretched his hand over and took the papers and did not forget to caress her hand while he’s at it. But Cai Yan wasn’t enraged by his actions as she knew that Su Tao only wanted to comfort her. Without her knowing, Su Tao had risen into an omnipotent figure in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Xia Yu drove, Su Tao sat on the front passenger seat and came to the business address on the navigation. To increase efficiency, Su Tao did not contact the local officials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao knocked on the officer, it was a standard office without any checkpoints that were placed layers upon layers as he had expected. The security guard did not even stop him from entering as the logic behind it was simple. Anyone sane wouldn’t come here to cause trouble. Although this is not an important agency, it can help clear up some examination procedures, which proved its extraordinary background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swiftly, the door opened as it was a man in green uniform that looks to be in his mid-twenties. Su Tao knew that this person must be the assistant of this office that assists the leaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you?” That person asked in alert as he looked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m here to look for Director Qiu!” Su Tao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Director Qiu isn’t around!” That youth locked his brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao could hear laughter coming from the office as this person before he was clearly lying. Knitting his brows, Su Tao questioned, “If Director Qiu isn’t around, then whose voice is coming from inside there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is that related to you? If you want to get things done, go through the standard procedures. If I say that he’s not around, then he’s not around.” When the man finished, he straightforwardly shut the doors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao took it much better as he had already expected this, but Xia Yu was fuming with anger as he was on the verge of charging up. However, he was stopped by Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bloody hell, who the hell are you even? You actually dare to act like a boss with me?” Xia Yu raged. “When I came out to society, you were still undergoing puberty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then the youth who was closing the door heard Xia Yu’s insult, he opened the door and glared at Xia Yu, “What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m calling you a shit-eating dog!” Xia Yu precisely wanted to blow up the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth harrumphed coldly, “This is an office, and I will not mess with you. But just watch out when you step out of the door.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu did not even bother arguing as he threw a kick out. His kick lashed out with precise accuracy, but the youth reacted swiftly as he took half a step back. Although he did not suffer the full blow of this lash, there was still a footprint left on his abdomen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That youth felt that Xia Yu was just an outsider, and yet, the latter dares to act so rampantly in his territory? But as this was an office, he wasn’t in a spot to get involved as he closed the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That youth naturally recognized either Su Tao or Xia Yu, which was the reason why he purposely rejected the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you stop me?” Xia Yu commented unhappily as he still didn’t get his anger vented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why do you seem as if you’ve eaten explosive?” Su Tao asked. Xia Yu was usually a composed person, and his action today was unusual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I could that with a glance that that fellow is a firefighter from birth. He’s just useless trash, and I look down on people like him the most.” Xia Yu spat a mouthful of phlegm on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a saying, the army is lame, the navy is arrogant, the air force is cocky, the police are a bunch of hoodlums, and leaders of the triads are firefighters. Among the uniformed groups, firefighters are being looked down upon due to lack of discipline compared to armed forces, and there would also be stories about firefighters bullying the common folks spreading in society.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a weak smile, it was no wonder that Xia Yu would be filled with such contempt when the youth tried to threaten them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although they were rejected in their faces, Xia Yu’s performance had won them some face back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry about that. I’ve affected your matters.” When Xia Yu recovered from his raging emotions, he apologized to Su Tao, “Actually, I was initially posted to be a firefighter when I retired as a soldier, but someone framed me. Under a fit of anger, I failed to obey orders and came out to start my own career.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao doesn’t know much about Xia Yu’s past, but he knew that the latter was someone with a story and smiled, “No worries. Since they’re trying to affect our operation, they’re naturally in the wrong. I will hear your story out in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Xia Yu shrugged as he mocked himself, “What story can I have? I’m just an insignificant figure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more Xia Yu spoke about it, the more curious Su Tao got.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Leaving the office, four vans came out of nowhere with people started coming down from those vans just when Su Tao and Xia Yu were about to board the vehicle. After a rough estimation, Su Tao determined that they were at least over thirty people among them. All of them wore casual clothing, but they were holding onto various extendable batons, which Su Tao could tell that they were all trained personnel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader waved his hand in the direction of two of them as everyone charged forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With cold flickering in his eyes, Xia Yu took the initiative and pounced forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing by the window, the youth who had a conflict with Xia yu earlier stood before a middle-aged man and spoke out, “The Medicine Deity Corporation’s pretty quick. Their men already arrived in just a few minutes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The middle-aged man was the person that Su Tao and Xia Yu were looking for, Qiu Hai. Locking his brows together, he replied, “Xiao Rui, give a call to Bai Fan and remind him not to cause any life in this matter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir, it won’t concern us even if anything happens. Mr. Bai promised that this matter is his personal grudge, and we won’t be involved.” A disdain flickered in Xiao Rui’s eyes as he was filled with hatred for Xia Yu. Even if the latter did not die, he wanted to latter to suffer greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I told you to make the call!” Qiu Hai sighed as he had no favorable impression of Bai Fan. He had already expected that Su Tao would come looking for him with regards to the fire safety regulation approval, and the reason why he stopped the Three Flavour Hall’s branch from opening in He City was due to an order he received. It was from someone higher the ranks, which he could only follow. He had a keen sense of smell, and he could tell that there’s something amiss about this matter. So if he stood on the wrong side, his prospects might be affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was simple as the Medicine Deity Corporation has a significant influence in the capital of medicine, He City. With their strength, there’s no reason for them to pay such importance to a TCM pharmacy to the point of using the fire safety regulation approval as an excuse to obstruct them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So there’s only one explanation; that TCM pharmacy’s background isn’t simple, and they might have a shocking background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was considered reckless to start a fight in the middle of the street, but the Medicine Deity Corporation was that powerful. They had relations with both the underworld and government with a solid background, which they could bear the consequences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Medicine Deity Corporation came prepared as they arranged a few people standing at the outer circle to ward off any passerby. The moment they saw someone taking out their phones, they would seize those phones, and if those passersby aren’t cooperative, then they would teach them a lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As over thirty people surrounded Su Tao and Xia Yu in the center, they leaned their backs against each other as the encirclement started to shrink along with their mobility environment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If only Old Liu is here!” Xia Yu sighed. However, his eyes were flickering with intense fighting intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Liu was naturally referring to Liu Jianwei. That fellow has the strongest fighting capability in the Three Flavour Hall, but that fellow was in Hanzhou City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In terms of a fistfight, you’re not inferior compared to Old Liu!” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? How do you know about that?” Xia Yu took on a Bruce Lee stance as he rubbed his nose with his thumb and showed a cool stance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Liu said that you have constantly been trying to hide your strength, and you’re actually a deep and unfathomable expert.” Su Tao looked at Xia Yu with a complicated glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t expect that that fellow’s eyesight would be so keen.” Xia Yu proceeded to remove his coat and threw it on the car behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that Xia Yu wasn’t trying to act cool as that coat was a gift from his girlfriend, Di Yuqin. To him, it was a precious gift, and he removed it as he didn’t want to ruin it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Xia Yu might not be comparable to a killing machine like Liu Jianwei, he was more flexible, and he knew how to play by his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was within the range of the batons, two people swung their batons down in the direction of Xia Yu’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Xia Yu had also made his move. When the batons were above his head, he took a step forth and grabbed onto the two attackers’ wrist. The two attackers instantly felt their wrist turning weak as the batons fell from their hands. At the same time, Xia Yu right leg pushed against the knee of the person by his right while tripping the heel of the person in his left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two attackers instantly exclaimed as they lost the offense, and they didn’t even have the opportunity to defend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his hands, Xia Yu chopped at the back of their nape, which the two of them groaned and fell unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire process didn’t take longer than five seconds, and it was more elaborate compared to Liu Jianwei’s brute charge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao had also dealt with one person as needles flew out from his hands. He was akin to a hidden weapon expert straight out of a novel and instantly dropped a few more people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those attackers coming up were startled as they look at the few centimeter needles left on either the head or beneath the eye of their comrades as horror made them felt a chill down their spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had purposely gone heavy with his hands, and those struck by his needles were either spouting white foam or lost control of their bowels. In this instance, he was much more intimidating compared to Xia Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With those surrounding Su Tao suddenly cleared up, a flaw was revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xia Yu glanced at Su Tao’s fight, he felt ashamed. Recalling Su Tao’s previous praises to him, it sounded like sarcasm at this moment as Su Tao’s lethality was several times stronger than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, their attackers are only briefly trained personnel. If they were martial artists, Su Tao wouldn’t have such an easy time dealing with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting it in a nutshell, it was more effective for Su Tao to deal with these shrimps by using needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly ten-odd minutes later, the group of over thirty all laid down on the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, because of the sheer number they were facing, Su Tao and Xia Yu naturally suffered some light wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crime scene was filled with a stench of foulness. Although those attackers had all been dealt with, the passersby didn’t dare to take a closer look as the scene was too disgusting.</span></p>

Hence, they could only boast about their ranks and be 'cocky.'</span></p>
