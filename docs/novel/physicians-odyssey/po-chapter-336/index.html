 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao waved his hand at everyone to get them to leave, since he had some stuff he would like to say to Cao Dingjun privately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry for hiding your illness from you!” Su Tao calmly explained the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a white lie, and now that Cao Dingjun’s mind was clear, he should be able to differentiate despite his stubborn character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it. I know that you guys were doing it for my sake.” Cao Dingjun’s eyes coldly flickered. Despite having a reason to lie, he still couldn’t help having an ill feeling from being treated like a fool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since your mind is clear now and you understand what’s going on, it’s your decision if you’re accepting the treatment.” Su Tao arranged his medical box while explaining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I’m willing to accept the treatment, how long do I have?” Cao Dingjun asked after taking a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senile Dementia is a chronic disease, and with your condition, living another twenty years isn’t a problem.” Su Tao’s tone suddenly changed, “But you can only live in a muddle-minded state with your memory suffering a decline. Your physique will also undergo a different degree of weakening. Within a year, you will lose the ability of recognition; within three years, you will lose your ability to speak. Finally, you will lose your own ability to take care of yourself within five years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Dingjun’s lips moved as he stared at Su Tao. He hoped to tell from the latter’s expression that the latter was lying, but it was a pity that Su Tao’s expression was calm without any traces of what he said being a lie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I would rather die than live like that!” Cao Dingjun snorted as he balled his fists and hammered them on the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old man, that’s&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">if</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;you do not accept any treatment. If you’re willing to accept my treatment, then there will be an improvement in your condition.” Su Tao replied in neither servile nor overbearing attitude. “I can guarantee that you will be able to maintain your current condition for five years!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Cao Dingjun’s lips moved, his eyes flickered with hesitation. But after a long time, he shook his head. “No way. I don’t believe in doctors!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you trust doctors?” Su Tao knew that if he wanted Cao Dingjun to cooperate with the treatment, he would have to undo the latter’s knot in the heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because doctors are liars!” Cao Dingjun raged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“According to what I know, you’ve never received any medical treatment over the years, so how did you determine that doctors are all liars?” Su Tao tried to break through the weakness in Cao Dingjun’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no reason! I just don’t believe in doctors!” Cao Dingjun pondered for a long time before he raged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was fuming in his heart as someone jabbed his weak spot. He was an influential figure, and if it was someone else being hollered at by him, they would’ve been terrified to the point of kneeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, tell me the reason!” Su Tao smiled to alleviate the tensed atmosphere. Stimulating the old man’s emotions was preparation to undo the knot in the latter’s heart. “You underwent surgery years ago, and back then, the medical conditions were extremely terrible. They did not have any good anaesthesia; hence, you had to rely on your inhumane willpower to persevere through the operation, which has formed into a shadow in your heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nonsense!” Cao Dingjun ridiculed in disdain, “Are you calling me a coward?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not exactly.” Su Tao patiently explained, “You can’t conceal the pain in your body. Despite your firm character, the pain has also created an innate fear in you. Gradually, it has developed to the point that you would subconsciously want to avoid pain again. Putting it in a nutshell, that brain surgery back then has made you reject receiving any treatment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Dingjun fell into silence. Although Su Tao’s words were a little confusing, it did make sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao continued, “But you don’t have to worry. If you allow me to treat you, I promise that there won’t be any surgery involved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hearing his words, Cao Dingjun looked at Su Tao with a complicated light. He was a stubborn person, and it wasn’t easy for him to suddenly change his mindset. However, he was forced to make a decision right now since he was ill, seriously ill to the point of losing his mind. The thought of living in a muddle-minded state made him feel fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why? Because he’s the Silver Fox, someone who was respected for his wisdom. If he was really suffering from Senile Dementia, it was akin to being crippled. At the same time, respect in the eyes of others would turn into pity. As someone with a strong ego, Cao Dingjun would rather die than suffer that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Cao Dingjun felt an innate struggle in his heart upon hearing the word “treatment”, and even&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">he</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;had no idea why. So after Su Tao’s patient explanation, he finally understood the reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was young, he was injured by a fragment of an explosive to his brain. For that, he received a commendation, which was also the start of his legend. However, he never expected that it would also leave a shadow in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t convince himself that he was actually afraid of being hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Predicting the turmoil in Cao Dingjun’s heart, Su Tao patiently guided, “Old man, it’s not embarrassing to be sick. On the contrary, your illness was leftover from your glorious experience in the past, and it’s the proof of your legacy. I know that due to physiological reasons, it’s impossible to instantly dissolve the shadow in your heart, so I earnestly request you to have someone decide for you, since you’re unable to do it yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have others to decide for me?” Cao Dingjun absent-mindedly laughed, “In my entire life, I’ve always been the decision-maker. You want me to trust my health to others? I won’t be able to accept that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will never be an eternal decision-maker.” Su Tao smiled as he continued, “In battlefields, even&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">you</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;have to obey orders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished speaking, he gave a call to Sire Shui and discussed Sire Cao’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A brief moment later, Su Tao handed the phone over to Sire Cao. “Sire Shui has something to say to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Cao Dingjun sighed. He had a new insight into Su Tao. This young physician had meticulous thoughts, and his thoughts had deeper layers. At this moment, he had to admit that he was only a foot away from accepting Su Tao’s treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Cao, your health doesn’t belong to you alone. It concerns the organisation and nation, as well. Now, I’m strongly requesting you to obey orders and accept Su Tao’s treatment, unless you are incapable of doing so.” Through the phone, Sire Shui calmly gave out his orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, Sire Cao’s expression turned solemn as he recalled his life on the battlefield back then and replied without any hesitation, “I will heed Leader’s instructions!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a smile, Sire Shui continued, “Old Cao, trust my judgment and Little Su’s skills. He will definitely be able to treat you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Cao Dingjun showed a relaxed smile. It wasn’t easy to resolve the knot in the heart, but by grabbing onto the flaw in the heart, it was easy to channel through it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Handing the phone over to Su Tao, Cao Dingjun showed a wry smile. “I never expected that you’re truly someone. Since my ex-leader has already given me an order, I will listen to your instructions and accept the treatment. But I only recognise you, no one else is allowed to treat me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a weak smile, Su Tao knew that Cao Dingjun was more stubborn than Sire Shui. Despite losing, he was still so earnest on his lips to retain some face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Su Tao had also seen through Cao Dingjun’s thoughts, which was the reason why he made so much effort to unknot the latter’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A doctor will never knock on the patient’s door, but there was another, deeper meaning to it. If the patient wasn’t willing to accept treatment, then it’s futile, even if you gave a prescription for them when they’re uncooperative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Dingjun was now willing to accept treatment, and that was the most crucial factor. After using medication to nourish the body, the old man’s body will improve, and it will be easier to conduct his treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We will end the talk here today, and I’ll brew medicine for you now. You must be exhausted, so please take a rest.” Su Tao bade his farewell to Cao Dingjun before leaving the ward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing outside the ward, Cao Huaiqing immediately went up when he saw Su Tao coming out. “Physician Su, how’s my father?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His condition has been stabilised for the time being, but he will require a long time to improve his physique!” Su Tao patiently explained. “I will prepare medicine for him now, so please give me a place to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No problem!” At this moment, Cao Huaiqing’s trust in Su Tao was deep, so he immediately went out to give instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking over, Xia Dechun gave an embarrassed smile. “Physician Su, you’re young, and yet, your medical skills are extraordinary. It’s truly admirable!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a humble smile, Su Tao replied, “Thanks for your compliments. TCM and Western Medicine both have their own advantages. Take Sire Cao’s illness as an example, it concerns his state of mind, and it’s beyond the capability of apparatuses. TCM emphasises finding the origin of the illness, and start resolving the issue at the root.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a sigh, Xia Dechun responded, “I have no lack of TCM experts around me, and they constantly made me feel that they’re shrouded in mystery. They wouldn’t talk much when treating, but you’re unlike them. Your methods are defined, and they’re so appropriate that they even left a spectator like me in admiration.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s because of the technique I use. Sincerity isn’t a mystery, it’s only a petty trick.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Dechun was briefly stunned and did not continue talking. There was a phrase that all paths are connected. For true experts, their methods would be more straightforward when it comes to a difficult problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a national healer, he might be skilled, but he couldn’t be that smooth when it comes to treatment, which was why he felt that TCM was continuously veiled in mystery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was the most talented physician amongst the younger generation, and it was genuinely admirable for him to reach this height at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief consideration, Xia Dechun grabbed onto Su Tao’s wrist. “I have a quota for this year’s National Healer Candidacy, and I’m willing to recommend you if you’re willing to participate in the examination.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His actions startled Su Tao, since he and Xia Dechun were only considered to have met once before.</span></p>
