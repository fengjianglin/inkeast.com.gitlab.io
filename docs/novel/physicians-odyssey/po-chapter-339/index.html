 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao has never seen such a man without class. Regardless of anything, she could be considered as a beauty, and Su Tao showed no tender feelings for the fairer sex by closing the door, which clamped onto her arm. Since she was only wearing a leather jacket, the surging pain soon brought tears to her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was trying to teach this unruly lady a lesson since she previously made a scene, which resulted in him scalding his hand. Hence, he naturally had to punish her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps she might be a princess in the eyes of others, but in Su Tao’s view, she was nothing but a pampered girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite her young age and makeup that made her look mature, she didn’t even have the temperament of a girl in her prime. On the contrary, there was a hint of filth around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Su Tao was someone that admired beautiful things and women with different styles, Cao Jiaojiao wasn’t his cup of tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, perhaps he might consider it if she stripped herself and laid on his bed. After all, this lady was pretty good-looking, and she had the delicate features of a girl from Minnan Province.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a series of thoughts flashing through her mind, Cao Jiaojiao pushed the door open with all her might and sat on the chair while rubbing her arm. “You’re doing this on purpose, right?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his bandaged hand before Cao Jiaojiao, Su Tao sarcastically said, “Why would I? Am I that petty?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao felt her mind exploding from the anger. However, she came with an objective, so she calmed her emotions and replied, “After calming down, I felt that my father was right. You saved my grandpa, and I shouldn’t treat you in that manner. So I’m here to apologise to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liar, liar, pants on fire!” Su Tao smiled as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words made Cao Jiaojiao feel a chill down her spine. This fellow couldn’t have seen through her act, right? With her brows knitted, she continued with her act, “You don’t believe me! Alright, there’s nothing I can do!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You reek of alcohol. Even if you’re not lying, you must be having a drunk talk.” Su Tao explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Cao Jiaojiao was relieved that Su Tao was referring to that. When she flung her arm, the pain had already alleviated, so she asked with her brows furrowed, “Then, are you accepting my apology?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We didn’t have any deep enmity, to begin with. You injured my hand, and I injured your arm. We’re fair now, and we don’t owe each other anything!” Su Tao shrugged as he watched Cao Jiaojiao rub her arm. Inwardly, he was laughing. He definitely wouldn’t alleviate her pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Cao Jiaojiao slammed the table with her other hand and smiled. “Since you’re willing to resolve our grudges, then I believe you will give me face if I want to treat you to a few drinks, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Settlement drinks?” Su Tao helplessly smiled. Despite being a descendant from an influential family, why was there such a significant difference between her and Shui Junzhuo? Settlement drinks were typically practised by the underworld to resolve their grudges, and it was actually suggested by Cao Jiaojiao, who came from an influential family?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao already had an understanding of Cao Jiaojiao. This lady was not someone easy to deal with, and she must definitely have a motive in coming here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s one possibility, being Cao Huaiqing was unhappy with her actions today, and she came to apologise to put up an act for her father; another being that she held ill intentions in her visit. If this lady drank a little too much and stripped her clothes on his bed before calling for the police to frame him for rape, it would be severe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, the latter had a lower possibility. After all, Cao Jiaojiao was the princess of the Cao Family, and she wouldn’t resort to such a despicable method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As someone that knew how to weigh his benefits, Su Tao knew he had to maintain a good relationship with the Cao Family. After all, the Minnan Province represented an important location for the expansion of Three Flavour Hall’s branches. He could foresee that he wouldn’t have any peace if he had a terrible relationship with Cao Jiaojiao if the latter came to pick a bone with him every few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, just a few cups.” In the end, Su Tao agreed to Cao Jiaojiao’s request. Cao Jiaojiao was a lady with a skinny frame, so would he be afraid of her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite his words, Su Tao still grabbed onto his phone and secretly turned on the video function as a precaution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten-odd minutes later, an attendant sent snacks and a bottle of red wine over as Cao Jiaojiao instructed, “Open it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the attendant opened the wine, Cao Jiaojiao nodded her head. “Alright, just leave it there. I’ll pour it myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the attendant left, Cao Jiaojiao poured the red wine into the decanter along with a few ice cups. A brief moment later, she poured the wine into the glasses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao observed Cao Jiaojiao’s actions, he noticed that her actions were extremely skilful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Here, finish it! After this cup, the conflicts between us will be written off! As the saying goes, fights can result in a friendship. In the future, we might even be best friends!” Cao Jiaojiao handed a glass over to Su Tao before bumping hers with him, which emanated a crisp sound, and gulped the red wine in her glass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Su Tao raised his hand with the cup by his lips. After a brief hesitation, he still decided to drink it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching Su Tao drinking the wine, Cao Jiaojiao smiled. She was in a great mood. “Come, let’s have another cup!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao stood up and responded, “Since the Missy of the Cao Family has such a good mood, then I naturally have to keep you company. Here, I’ll return you a glass with politeness!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Cao Jiaojiao sat on the chair as she looked at Su Tao pouring the wine and inwardly counted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One…two…three…fall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as she had expected, Su Tao was akin to a robot when his hand paused after touching the decanter. Turning around, he had rage plastered on his face. “You… actually… doped my drink!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body swayed. He was like a candle in the breeze and dropped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao collapsed onto the ground and was no longer moving, Cao Jiaojiao burst into laughter. She walked over and used her leg to kick his waist to probe him, which she felt that the knockout drug Zhong Ying gave her was really useful. In just a dozen minutes, two people have fallen for it; that was simply a lethal weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bending down, Cao Jiaojiao pulled Su Tao’s hair and coldly looked at that disgusting face of his. “You’re just a doctor, and yet you dare to offend me? Watch how I’ll deal with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more she looked at Su Tao’s face, the more furious she felt and raised her hand to slap him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since young, that was the first time Cao Huaiqing has ever hit her, and he actually slapped her for an outsider? Hence, she naturally had to take revenge for her humiliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when her hand was a few centimetres away from Su Tao’s head, a robust hand came out of nowhere and suddenly grabbed onto hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao’s eyes abruptly opened with a sinister smile hanging on his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene terrified Cao Jiaojiao. Her first reaction was that she was duped. He never fell for her drugs, to begin with!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how was that possible? She saw Su Tao finish drinking it with her own eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That knockout drug came from America, and it came with a hefty cost. In order to ensure that Su Tao would be knocked out, she even increased the dosage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao hated this woman. If he hadn’t been a cautious person, he would have already fallen for her trick, and he wouldn’t have an idea what she would do to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao was also trained in martial arts, which she tried to use a grappling technique to break free from Su Tao’s restraints. However, Su Tao wasn’t an ordinary person. Because of the Pulse Art, not even an Olympic champion might be his opponent in terms of flexibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grabbing onto Cao Jiaojiao’s hand that was about to slap his face, he twisted her hand towards the back while using another hand to grab her abdomen. In this manner, Cao Jiaojiao would be restrained despite her skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soft texture came from her abdomen. His hand was beneath her underboob. Due to his career, Su Tao had no qualms about men and women, to begin with. Not to mention that in his eyes, Cao Jiaojiao was a venomous snake. Thus, he did not hold back against her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao felt her chest being squeezed and her heart nearly jumped out. She thought that this man was too outrageous to dare to act so rudely with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You scoundrel!” Cao Jiaojiao raged. But due to her breath being stuck in her chest, even her curses were powerless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao placed a hand on her right chest, but he wasn’t trying to take advantage of her on purpose. This was just a better way for him to restrain her and prevent her from screaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m just giving you a taste of your own medicine.” Su Tao sneered. “Don’t think that just because you’re the princess of the Cao Family, everyone in the world will bow to you. In my eyes, you’re nothing but a fart!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I swear that as long as I don’t die… I definitely won’t let you off…” Cao Jiaojiao felt that it was excruciating to even say a single word. She had no idea that Su Tao was pressing on an acupoint located on her chest, and in just a brief moment, she would lose her ability to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few minutes later, Cao Jiaojiao widened her mouth in horror. She realised that she had lost her ability to speak. She felt as if she was dying and her soul was about to leave her body. She could not convey her words to the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fear dominated her mind as she felt endless regret. She was still young, and there were still many things that she hadn’t done. For example, she had never dated! If she died in this manner, wouldn’t it be too sad?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hand that Su Tao placed on her chest suddenly changed into fingers as he applied pressure and moved his fingers upwards. Much to Cao Jiaojiao’s horror, she realised that she had been turned into a puppet under Su Tao’s control. At this moment, her mouth was opening beyond her control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Su Tao had opened his mouth and a red liquid started flowing down, entering her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuck, disgusting!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;That was the last thought in Cao Jiaojiao’s mind. It turns out that Su Tao never drank the red wine she poured for him, he had been using a special technique to contain it all under his tongue. Which, at this moment, he was spitting it back out into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She actually ate the saliva of this disgusting man? At this moment, her first reaction was an urge to vomit, but she forgot about the knockout drug in the wine!</span></p>
