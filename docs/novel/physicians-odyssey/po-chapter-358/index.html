 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next morning, Su Tao came to Yan Jing’s Golden Bay. The security here was already familiar with Su Tao and they even considered him to be Yan Jing’s lover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His path was unhindered as he parked the car by the villa. After pressing on the doorbell, Aunt Liu, who was the housekeeper, opened the door and smiled. “Physician Su, you’re here! Please, head to the second floor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aunt Liu did not consider Su Tao to be an outsider. She just returned to her other matters after opening the door for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao came to the second floor, soft music was being played and Yan Jing was wearing purple yoga clothes while stretching her waist on a yoga mat. There was a pair of beige sandals placed beside the yoga mat. Her chin was raised, and she made a stunning curve with her soft waist. Her legs were raised to her head and her purple-painted toenails were placed beside her ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao entered, Yan Jing smiled and her legs touched the ground before she made a frontal rotation. That scene alone was filled with a charm that left Su Tao dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao realised that Yan Jing’s body was too flexible. Why hadn’t he noticed it in the past?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where’s Hua Yan?” Su Tao coughed as he shifted his gaze from Yan Jing’s body; he could feel the blood in his body boiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since she had to sweat it out when exercising, she did not wear much. At this moment, she used a woollen towel to cover her revealed skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I took your suggestion and sent her to a nursery school. She practically asks me every day about when you will be visiting! She’s way too reliant on you!” Yan Jing wore her beige sandals as she wiped her sweat with the towel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sounds like she has recovered pretty well!” Su Tao glanced at the balcony. Although it was still in the early spring, flowers were starting to bloom with a faint aroma that created a peculiar feeling in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have you to thank for that. She can now communicate normally, but she’s still pretty antisocial at the nursery. She doesn’t play with the other kids at all.” Yan Jing had mixed feelings in her eyes as she occasionally looked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to be too worried about that, just let her interact with the other kids. Anyone would need time to adapt to a new environment, and Hua Yan’s process might be a little longer. But you have to be patient, and even if she shows any fluctuations in her emotions, you have to toughen your heart and let her resolve it by herself. That’s because she cannot be living in her own world forever, she has to learn to be independent. She has to rely on herself to take that step out.” Su Tao patiently analysed. Hua Yan wasn’t the same as other kids with autism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, her condition wasn’t that serious, and it wasn’t an innate condition; secondly, she has been recovering pretty well, she just needs to remove the barrier herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, don’t worry about it. I will listen to you in any matters that concern Hua Yan!” Yan Jing rolled her pupils before she gave a sweet smile. When she walked towards Su Tao, her body fragrance faintly drifted in his direction, since she had just exercised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subconsciously taking a step back, Su Tao wanted to dodge the fragrance blowing in his direction and coughed, “I’m actually here because I need help from you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You and I were never that polite!” Yan Jing briefly paused before she added with a smile, “We’re partners.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I intend to design an application that provides TCM specialist consultation within the next half year.” Su Tao immediately shared his idea with Yan Jing. “This is not a supplementary, but it’s an important development for the future of TCM.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knitting her brows, Yan Jing replied, “I need more details about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right now, patients require a long time queuing to have their illnesses seen. If we can design an application where patients can directly communicate with a physician through it, it will save a lot of time.” Su Tao patiently analysed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting her hands together, Yan Jing praised, “This is a pretty good idea, and at that time, we won’t have to be afraid of having no patients. We might even be concerned with having too many patients, and you might not have enough doctors! Everyone needs a platform for them to consult their illnesses, even for a small one. Sometimes, making a trip to the hospital for a common flu is truly inconvenient, and if they can find a specialist through the phone, it will be faster. I believe this idea will be a great success.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Yan Jing immediately figured it all out, Su Tao continued, “This is the biggest advantage that TCM has over Western Medicine. Western Medicine relies on apparatuses, but TCM relies on our diagnosing skills like observation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although technology is developed, there’s still a difference to the video quality. So what if a mistake was made?” After Yan Jing acknowledged this proposal, she started looking for loopholes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can conduct training before the application goes online. Firstly, we will ensure that every single one of them has a sturdy foundation with their medical skills and medical ethics; secondly, we can list out illnesses that can be prescribed through the application and those that require patients to pay a visit to the hospital for a checkup.” Su Tao had pondered over this concept for a long time. As a physician of the newer generation, he had to keep up with the trend to promote TCM. If they still limited themselves, it wouldn’t be possible for them to allow the integration of TCM into society.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief silence, Yan Jing showed a wry smile. “You’ve changed my view about you once more!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there might be someone who thought of this creativity, it was shocking for Su Tao to think of it as a physician himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was mainly due to the fact that TCM was considered an antique in the mindset of many people. There might be young physicians, but their line of thought wasn’t as lively as Su Tao’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Modern society was all about the internet, which gave Su Tao the inspiration for TCM to interact with the internet as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t wish for a third party company to handle this application, and I want to create my own technical team in the Three Flavour Hall.” Su Tao had his own thoughts, since the technical department wouldn’t be as simple as designing the application, but other development as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Yan Jing realised that she has underestimated Su Tao’s determination and smiled. “The monthly profits of the Three Flavour Cosmetics International has already reached ¥5,000,000. So taking ¥1,000,000 wouldn’t be a problem. Furthermore, the official application can also be used as a marketing channel. Not only can they use the application to enjoy medical services, but they can also use it to purchase Three Flavour Cosmetics International’s products. Killing two birds with one stone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their proposal was constantly being perfected through discussions, and Yan Jing was keener than Su Tao in terms of her business sense; it was her forté.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao immediately smiled, “I’m just suggesting an idea, and you’re the expert on how we are going to progress with this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing’s eyes flickered as she said, “The health industry is a growing industry, and I believe that I’ve not made the wrong choice. Don’t worry about it. I am trying to use all the resources available to create our own brand in the Three Flavour Cosmetics International. Next step, the Three Flavour Cosmetics International will be integrating with similar products to move in the direction of luxury goods.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Su Tao realised that Yan Jing and Vera have been communicating privately. He was entirely focused on the Three Flavour Hall, so he simply dumped the Three Flavour Cosmetics International to them. So when he heard about luxury goods, he was instantly captivated by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing confidently declared, “With China growing stronger, Chinese culture is also slowly made known to the western world, and many people have considered China’s culture as a trend. Such as tattoos of Chinese phrases. But so far, there isn’t an impressive luxury brand from China. After the past half-year of attempt, the Three Flavour Cosmetics International’s products have received high popularity, especially from women. After discussing it with Vera, we’ve decided to open up derivative products other than cosmetics. like Chinese-styled clothing, perfume, and leather products!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After knowing that Yan Jing had such ambition, Su Tao was briefly stunned before he said, “I initially wanted to create a brand that’s in touch with the people, and affordable for everyone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking her head, Yan Jing smiled. “You’re thinking about a brand that’s affordable for everyone in China, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing understood Su Tao’s character, since he was a nationalist down to his bones. It was also the reason why he’s so firmly attached to TCM.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She also hoped to strengthen this characteristic of Su Tao’s, which was the reason why she personally tailored those Chinese robes for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrugging his shoulders, Su Tao replied, “You understand me the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you really want the Three Flavour Hall’s products to be affordable for everyone, we can just create another brand. But for the skincare products in Three Flavour Cosmetics International, we definitely have to go through the luxury branding route.” Yan Jing seriously said before she continued, “This is a marketing strategy. The Three Flavour Cosmetics International has already been shaped, and it cannot be changed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing’s persistence was due to her own judgement. It was a conclusion she obtained from the research of professional marketing teams. With a smile, Su Tao did not talk about it any further. He could only say that he’s not professional enough. Letting out a cough, he sighed, “I’ll listen to your arrangements, then. I’ll just focus on being a physician!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he came to find Yan Jing today was to create an application for the Three Flavour Hall. So when he saw that Yan Jing received an important call, he bade his farewell and head for the Yan Residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He first headed to buy the ingredients for the herbal chicken that Yan Wujin craved. Compared to those in the market, Su Tao placed more thoughts into it and added his own research. It’s now the beginning of Spring, and it was easy to suffer from cold and flu. Hence, Su Tao added a few herbs meant for expelling coldness in the body. After cooking for roughly half an hour, an aroma permeated, which attracted Yan Wujin to come in and take a look.</span></p>
