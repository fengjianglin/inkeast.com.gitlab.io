 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Recently, Su Tao has encountered some trouble that implicated my medical clinic as well. Thus, I feel the need to explain to everyone.” Kim Jung-ho calmly said before he continued, “Su Tao is someone in the same field that I admire, and I do not wish for him to be treated with such injustice. At the same time, many truths have been twisted, which makes me feel uncomfortable, not to mention that both my sister and I are involved in this as well. So now, please look at the screen again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The screen lit up once again, showing the battle between Su Tao and Kim Jung-ho in the International Medical Summit that was recently hosted in South Korea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have to go all the way back to last year, when Su Tao and I met in the Three States Forum Exchange held at Yuhang City. During the competition, TKM crushed TCM entirely. But soon, I realised that China’s representatives weren’t the best. During an incident, I discovered Su Tao’s shocking ability, which was the reason why I invited him to participate in the International Medical Summit hosted in South Korea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho wore a smile as he calmly reminisced, “Back then, I was extremely excited because he’s an opponent worthy of my respect. During the International Medical Summit, I tried my best to compete with Su Tao. Back then, we were both treating a patient with a benign tumor, in which he crushed me entirely. When I lost our competition, I honored our bet and changed the name of my medical center to Three Flavour Hall. So, strictly speaking, the Three Flavour Hall located in Seoul is my personal asset, and Su Tao has nothing to do with it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Kim Jung-ho’s explanation, a commotion broke out once more. Although the reporters still had their own doubts, the seed had already been planted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Truth be told, before I met Su Tao, I was filled with disdain for the TCM standard of your country. Although TKM originated from TCM, TCM’s development has been falling behind TKM. I personally felt that there’s a huge gap between the two medical studies, so I have never placed TCM with any importance. But after my competition with Su Tao, I realised that there’s always someone better in the world.” Kim Jung-ho sighed. “But now, I’m filled with indignance. How can such a charismatic man that fought for the dignity of his country be called a traitor by his people? I believe there’s no greater grievance than this, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho’s words instantly caused silence in the field and many people felt ashamed that they had to be reprimanded by a Korean. This Korean was defending their own fellow countryman, whom they even joined in to denounce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation had a sudden turnabout. After all, the supportive words from a Korean were way more powerful than anyone’s speech.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho was also taking a risk since he might be called a traitor in his own country for standing out and defending Su Tao. However, he was driven to do this due to the respect he felt for Su Tao in the depths of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yesterday, his sister called him, and he pondered for a long time. He even went on to discuss this matter with his grandfather. Hence, the moment he obtained approval from his grandfather, he made a decisive decision to come over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao might be a narrow-minded nationalist and has been treating him with indifference, but Kim Jung-ho still felt the need to speak the truth. After all, if this controversy buried Su Tao, not only would it impact the rise of China’s TCM, but it’s also a significant loss for the whole of Asia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Kim Jung-ho went on to explain the details that occurred during the International Medical Summit on how Su Tao made use of his medical skills to convince worldwide professionals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the reporters couldn’t understand the medical terms being used, they were also captivated by the story with their blood boiling. So it turned out that there’s a young man in China that shouldered the burden of TCM by himself to win praises in another country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right; he’s such a charismatic person. Even if he’s my opponent, I was convinced by his medical ability, not to mention that his medical ethics were likewise praiseworthy. There are also many people in South Korea that received his help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yet, you guys are actually accusing such an outstanding person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re calling someone like him a traitor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t this ridiculous? Isn’t this an irony? Isn’t this despicable? Is there anything in the world that’s more disappointing than this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I feel that you should all do some reflection!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho's series of questions was akin to a hammer that struck everyone’s chests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Secondly, I believe that everyone must be curious about the relationship between Su Tao and my sister, right?” Kim Jung-ho briefly pondered, then smiled. “That sister of mine has loved China’s culture since young, and even majored Mandarin in university. She’s an independent girl with her own thoughts, and she firmly believed in Su Tao’s success after meeting him. Hence, she created an international fan club for Su Tao. Due to Su Tao’s dazzling performance in South Korea, he won the hearts of many girls in South Korea, and I believe that my sister is one of them. However, the feelings of my sister are like my feelings for a certain celebrity in China; it’s the adoration of a fan for their idol that’s pure and innocent. How can it be turned into a reason used to attack Su Tao? Can it be that someone’s jealous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing Kim Jung-ho’s question, the reporters all fell into silence once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had won over the hearts of Koreans, and it should be something honorable. But due to the mastermind of this scandal, he became a traitor that went against all logic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the reporters all felt ashamed and humiliated since they had been misled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Kim Jung-ho bowed to the reporters and continued, “Even if our two countries are in a complicated relationship, I feel that we should all be reasonable. Even despite being Korean, I admire Su Tao. So I hope that everyone can see the truth and help him restore his reputation. For a doctor, their reputation is equivalent to their own life. With this, I end my speech. Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words were sincere, which made everyone feel emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amongst the crowd, the reporters couldn’t hold back from clapping and the applause echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the two countries were in a tense relationship, Kim Jung-ho’s action has won their respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching this, a smile rose on Yan Jing’s lips as she sighed. She never expected that Kim Jung-ho would make the trip over to Hanzhou City to clear up Su Tao’s name. It was something that has exceeded her expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was precisely because of this matter that everyone was convinced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t even have to guess what would happen next. In just a few hours from now, the entire scandal will collapse. After the reporters came to know about the truth, they would surely clean Su Tao’s name. At the same time, Huo Kun, Du Yu, Wang Guofeng, and the Medicine Deity Corporation will be under fire for their despicable scheme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With that, this press conference has come to an end, and I hereby thank everyone for coming here. In just a moment, our branding department will hand out notes of this press conference for everyone, so do support us.” The host waited for Kim Jung-ho to leave before he announced the closure of this event.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reporters all started to scramble as they fought over the notes and swiftly typed out an article for their editors, which would soon be published on the various official media sites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing left in a hurry and saw Kim Jung-ho standing outside. Initiating a handshake, she thanked, “Thank you for coming. Because of your appearance, our press conference became a great success.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I only did what I thought was right. If Su Tao was truly done in by those vile creatures, then I would be in an awkward position.” Kim Jung-ho humbly replied as he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Awkward position?” Yan Jing was baffled as she looked at Kim Jung-ho.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Kim Jung-ho replied, “My medical clinic is now bearing the signboard of the Three Flavour Hall, and if Su Tao’s reputation was ruined, then wouldn’t my business be affected as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t seem to be such a materialistic person.” Yan Jing showed a complicated smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Kim Jung-ho wasn’t Chinese and he had his own view, Yan Jing could tell that he’s actually filled with respect for Su Tao from the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re overestimating me. Compared to me, Su Tao is the one who’s not materialistic.” Kim Jung-ho bitterly smiled in response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words caused Yan Jing to be briefly stunned. As Su Tao’s rival, Kim Jung-ho’s evaluation of him was impartial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from being a lecher, Su Tao really didn’t bother about materialistic gains, and his mind was solely focused on TCM.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If his reputation was ruined in this incident, then it would be a huge mental blow for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But fortunately, the situation was developing in a better direction.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the car, Huo Kun’s phone vibrated before he picked it up. He could tell from Wang Guofeng’s voice that the latter’s mood was terrible as he questioned him, “Have you heard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun was startled by the sudden question, so he asked in perplexion, “Young Master Feng, what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You still have no idea about it?! The entire internet has exploded! The controversy has been turned against us now!” Wang Guofeng felt the urge to slap himself, since he never expected that Huo Kun would be so stupid. He initially thought that the latter could be his trusted aide, but Huo Kun was simply a pig to admit that he was the mastermind!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll look at it, and I’ll give you a call back later.” Huo Kun nervously said, since he subconsciously knew that there’s trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Wang Guofeng coldly replied, “We should avoid contact for the time being so that the other party won’t be able to launch further attacks against us. But don’t worry about it, you’ll always be a brother of mine in my heart, and I will stand together with you no matter what happens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun was touched by Wang Guofeng’s words, so he responded, “Young Master Feng, don’t worry about it. I will take responsibility for what I’ve done, and I will not drag you down with me.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hanging up the call, Wang Guofeng knocked his finger against the desk and gave out orders to Luo Ran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immediately make a statement saying that the Medicine Deity Corporation has no relationship with Huo Kun, and we retain the right to pursue legal actions for the vile-intended accusation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we make a statement now, won’t that mean that we’ve admitted to it?” Luo Ran was shocked by the order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At least it’s better than doing nothing!” Wang Guofeng ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps Huo Kun will be disappointed when he sees the statement, but Wang Guofeng believes that the former could understand that they’re no longer the kids they used to be. They now had responsibility on their shoulders, and they had to make considerations for the bigger picture.</span></p>
