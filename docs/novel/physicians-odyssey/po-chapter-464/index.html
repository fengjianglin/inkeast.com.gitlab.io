<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of Qin Jingyu’s help, the Three Flavour International failed to get the patents and even suffered negative news. The Vice-Bureau Chief of the National Intellectual Property Administration, Meng Haode, gave out directives that this case would be used as an example to strike down those that were trying to abuse patents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this matter, Wang Guofeng also retaliated and sued the Three Flavour International. With the conflict of the two biggest herbal skincare companies risen to a new level, the controversy became heated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, it was sufficient for the Medicine Deity Corporation that they could resolve the problem. After all, they’re in the same industry and falling out completely benefited no one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But their retaliation has brought the conflict into the public. Perhaps they might be able to affect the Three Flavour International, but it’s nothing beneficial for them in the long run either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To put it simply, the Medicine Deity Corporation’s retaliation was beautiful with the Three Flavour International’s brand being affected. This was also the condition that Qin Jingyu gave to Wang Guofeng for his help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Yan Jing was reporting this matter to Su Tao and sighed, “I initially wanted to use the same method to teach the Medicine Deity Corporation a lesson, but I never expected that it would cause such big trouble. The National Intellectual Property Administration’s branch in the province has been visiting the company several times, causing panic amongst the employees. The Medicine Deity Corporation’s retaliation is too ferocious, so we won’t let them have the chance to fight back next time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing had shown her vicious side at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao locked his brows together. He did not know that Wang Guofeng’s action this time was directed by someone, so he replied, “Use your relations to seek help from the province. As for the city, I will find someone to mediate this matter. I believe that they won’t make things too difficult for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he asked Du Ping for help, he believed that the latter would surely help him clear up the relations in the city. But from the current situation, this matter wasn’t at the city level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve already investigated the matter. It was an order from the National Intellectual Property Administration, and the province has no choice but to take action.” Yan Jing sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that Yan Jing was powerful in Huainan Province. Since she was helpless in this matter, then it must have gone out of her control. “I’m currently in Beijing, but I will try and find a way to resolve this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Yan Jing responded, “We will go two separate ways! I will try and look through my connections and see if someone has connections to the National Intellectual Property Administration.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, Yan Jing called Su Tao mainly to notify him about this matter. After all, Su Tao was currently preparing for the National Healer Selection and knew nobody in Beijing. So how could he possibly gain connections to the National Intellectual Property Administration?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first person that came to his mind was Shui Junzhuo. After all, amongst those around him, only Shui Junzhuo had that ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The resources of the Shui Family was something that he would not touch unless absolutely necessary, not to mention that Su Tao had a habit of resolving his own problems instead of relying on the women around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he flagged a cab and headed to the ranch that he and Shui Junzhuo promised to visit. When he came to the reception, he was instantly led to the horse field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beijing was the heart of China’s politics, and it’s also a place where many influential figures gather. In this city, you could easily find things that only the upper class interacts with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Take this ranch, for example, it had a high requirement, and only those with a net worth of over a hundred million were qualified to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that it was all due to Shui Junzhuo that he could enjoy the atmosphere here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being in Beijing for some time, Su Tao noticed that he has been influenced. Putting it in a nutshell, he could feel himself being more ambitious than he was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to prove himself in Beijing by allowing TCM to regain the acknowledgment of the citizens, in which he had to conquer the heart of this country first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While his thoughts were running wild, a horse field appeared before his eyes. Although it wasn’t massive, it was complete with a grass field, mud field, sandy field, and a race course. Several riders were riding on the racetrack, and despite wearing the same outfit, Su Tao instantly found Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo wore a gabardine jacket, leather boots, a velvet riding hat, and had a whip in her right hand as she sat on a white horse. She didn’t seem to have noticed Su Tao’s arrival, since she focused on gracefully riding with the horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Shui Junzhuo looked in Su Tao’s direction and raised the whip. The horse exploded forth with stunning power as it galloped in Su Tao’s direction, dust rising in its path. On horseback, Shui Junzhuo seemed elegant and heroic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a great horse!” Su Tao looked at the speeding figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the horse was about ten meters away from Su Tao, it suddenly slowed down and the horse’s muscles swiftly responded, then stopped before Su Tao. After leaping off the horse, Shui Junzhuo smiled and gently patted the horse’s mane. “Why don’t you give it a try as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao modestly smiled. “No need for that. I have no idea how to ride a horse, and it won’t be good if I injured it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his words, Shui Junzhuo had no idea if Su Tao was joking, so she sourly glared at him before she snapped, “Aren’t you a little too full of yourself? You can injure the horse?” When she finished, she noticed her faulty wording and blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll not ride! The horses here seem extremely precious, and yours must be a legendary champion breed, right?” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising her thumbs in Su Tao’s direction, Shui Junzhuo exclaimed at Su Tao’s eyesight and praised, “Your eyesight is pretty good! This horse participated in competitions for years and has taken at least ten championships worldwide. Bright Prospects is the name of this horse, isn’t it pleasant?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing her words, Su Tao had a rough estimation of the horse’s worth. Generally, horses that could obtain ten international championships would receive about USD$4,000,000 from prize alone, and a champion breed like this must cost at least USD$7,000,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao felt an urge to give it a ride, since it was an opportunity, after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But while the two of them were chatting, a sturdy-built man walked over. Su Tao had a tall stature, but that man was three to four centimetres taller than him and had a bigger build.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pity flickered in Shui Junzhuo’s eyes, but she was surprised by Qin Jingyu’s sudden appearance and called out, “Big Brother Jingyu, what a coincidence that you’re here as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a warm smile on his lips, Qin Jingyu examined Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This must be your friend, right? Why don’t you introduce him to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Removing her glove, Shui Junzhuo gently tapped on her forehead and smiled. “Look at how muddle-headed I’ve become! This is Su Tao, a famous divine physician from Huainan Province.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you’re Su Tao!” Qin Jingyu stretched his hand out and smiled. “I’ve long heard of your name, and you must be the one that has treated Sire Shui, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was a little surprised since he didn’t know anything about Qin Jingyu, but he could tell that the latter had a good relationship with Shui Junzhuo, so he stretched his hand out as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao frowned when their hands came in contact. The domineering force coming from Qin Jingyu’s palm was definitely a gesture of provocation and threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Qin Jingyu focused on business now, he had once been in the military and was naturally well-trained. He originally wanted to test Su Tao, which was why he used a little more force on purpose when he shook hands. However, Su Tao was more sensitive than he had imagined and he retaliated with a stronger force, which Qin Jingyu could only respond by increasing his strength as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, a simple handshake has turned into a contest for strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Jingyu, who had been confident with his own strength, suddenly realised that Su Tao’s strength was shocking despite his build, his hand was akin to iron shackles that grabbed onto his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao did not feel any better. Qin Jingyu’s strength has exceeded his expectations as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But with Shui Junzhuo here, the two of them only shook their hands for five to six seconds before they separated, in case Shui Junzhuo notices something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao couldn’t help bringing his hand to his back and used his other hand to massage it, while inwardly cursing Qin Jingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Qin Jingyu, he was in a worse state. He felt that his bones were being crushed with intense pain jolting through him from his palm and his forearm was slightly twitching. However, he could bear the pain and maintained his calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was someone who practiced the Heavensezing Hands, so his hands were powerful despite looking tender and fair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Actually, it’s not a coincidence for me to be here. I actually came here to look for you.” Qin Jingyu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re leaving the country soon, so I naturally have to meet up with you more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Qin Jingyu was so blatant, Shui Junzhuo immediately glanced at Su Tao. She was worried that the latter might misunderstand those words. Soon after, she smiled. “Big Brother Jingyu, you’re putting it too seriously. It’s not as if I’m never coming back again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing her words, Qin Jingyu smiled, but he did not continue to speak. He was paying attention to Su Tao’s expression, in which he knew that the latter must understand the meaning behind his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao inwardly sighed. Although it might seem blissful for him to be surrounded by women, they’re actually his source of troubles as well, since they were too outstanding. The modern society was similar to an animal kingdom, where the leader amongst the pride of lions would naturally put other male lions in order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that Qin Jingyu must be one of his opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Su Tao had no idea about Qin Jingyu’s background, he could infer from Shui Junzhuo’s tone that this opponent was pretty powerful and his background must be comparable to the Shui Family. Furthermore, they seemed to be pretty close, and they must have known each other for years; logically speaking, he didn’t have a high chance of winning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since we’re here, why don’t we race?” Qin Jingyu smiled and continued, “I have a few decent horses myself. Although they pale in comparison to Junzhuo’s Bright Prospects with a pure bloodline and boundless potential. Su Tao, are you interested in giving it a try?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He doesn’t know how to ride horses!” Shui Junzhuo immediately explained on behalf of Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He can learn!” Qin Jingyu smiled, “This ranch is very professional, and the instructors here are decent. So you should give it a try since it’s a rare opportunity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao was annoyed with Qin Jingyu’s words, since it was evidently directed at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he couldn’t back down now, so he smiled. “I’ll give it a try, then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t even dare to ride a horse, then you’re not a man!” Qin Jingyu waved his hand and smiled, “Fetch me the new horse!”</span></p>
