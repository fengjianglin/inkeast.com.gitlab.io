 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Captain Zheng, isn’t the commotion caused by Black Leather a little too loud?” A prison officer asked in a worried tone with his brows locked together while drinking tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao’s scream for help resounded, there was an endless commotion that came from the cell along with blood-curdling screeches. The inmates in other cells were also paying attention to the commotion and were wondering who the newcomer offended to suffer so greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t bother about it. Someone has given instructions for us to turn a blind eye. In our trade, we have to occasionally turn a blind eye. After all, how many of those thrown in here are good people? So don’t be haunted by your compassion.” Captain Zheng replied. He was also worried that this might get out of hand, but many things were beyond his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“*Sigh* That’s true. No proper person would be thrown in here!” That young prison officer comforted himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a grin, Captain Zheng continued to lecture, “You will learn how to differentiate the situation after you’ve been here long enough. None of the prisoners here are good people, especially the newcomers. If you don’t show him some colors, how would he be obedient and cooperate with us in the future?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, that young prison officer smiled. “Captain Zheng is truly experienced.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The words of the young prison officer made Captain Zheng nod his head. After listening to the commotion for a while, he also got a little worried, “But that Black Leather is taking things a little too far. It has been an hour now, and they’re still not stopping?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since they’re still torturing, that means that the newcomer isn’t dead.” The young officer sighed while also feeling a little worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Captain Zheng became silent. Their prison were given an annual quota of death, and if worse comes to worst, he could just give that newcomer one of the quotas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the young officer suddenly spoke out after a brief consideration, “The newcomer hasn’t undergone sentencing yet. He was only temporarily moved here since it was dangerous to keep him in the police station. Will there be any issues with the procedures?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Captain Zheng sighed after hearing that the commotion had calmed down, “Let’s go. We’ll take a look at the situation. It will be somewhat troublesome if he dies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was a few years ago, when the internet wasn’t that developed, there would be frequent incidents where suspects would die before undergoing their sentence. But the higher management was stricter on this matter now, and if this matter was revealed, it wouldn’t be a small matter. Furthermore, that outsider’s identity was still unclear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two of them came back to the cell and opened the gate, Captain Zheng instantly knitted his brows as he looked around and asked, “What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was currently lying on their bed with their hands supporting their bodies. They seemed to be doing push-ups, and the scene was a little comical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir, we’re training our physique.” When one of the inmates saw their savior here, he immediately explained with tears streaking down his cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an unspoken rule amongst inmates that they’re not allowed to drag the prison officers into their personal conflicts. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have a good time in prison and would suffer the suppression of every inmate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you training your physique instead of sleeping at this time?” The young officer solemnly asked before he questioned, “What’s with the bruise on your face?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir, I fell earlier!” That inmate swiftly answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of you go to sleep!” Captain Zheng unhappily waved his hand and ordered. Suddenly, he felt that was something amiss with the situation and asked, “Where’s Black Leather?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir, he fainted.” Someone reported in a soft tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Captain Zheng looked over, he saw that Black Leather’s face was pale with white foam from his mouth lying in a corner and looked as if he was about to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened? Who did this?” Captain Zheng instantly felt his anger burning as he swept a glance around before looking at Su Tao.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It must be related to this brat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing by the bed, Su Tao explained after seeing Captain Zheng’s gaze on him, “Officer, he’s suffering from acute gastroenteritis. It should be caused by dinner.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did I ask you?” Captain Zheng glared at Su Tao before he continued, “So many people ate the meal, but why is he the one having problems? Answer me honestly, did you do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao smiled. “I’m a physician, and I can tell with a single look if he’s sick. You can send him for a checkup if you don’t believe me, and criticise me if I’ve made a mistake!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Captain Zheng’s face fell. Su Tao was truly sharp-tongued. It’s no wonder why someone wanted to mess with him outside. Being in prison for so many years, Black Leather had never suffered in this manner before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I suggest that you should get a doctor to look at him quickly. Otherwise, he will lose his life.” Although Su Tao wouldn’t be bothered with the death of a vile character like Black Leather, he still reminded. “Furthermore, that skinny man fell from the bed and broke one of his ribs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick, inform the infirmary!” Captain Zheng said as he ferociously glared at Su Tao. It was because Su Tao hadn’t undergone sentencing, and he couldn’t personally make a move against Su Tao as a prison officer. Otherwise, his prospects would be affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had decided in his heart to let Su Tao enjoy the night and deal with him tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The infirmary personnel swiftly came and took Black Leather away. After performing a checkup, they realised that Black Leather really was suffering from acute gastroenteritis, leaving Captain Zheng stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Su Tao, he only had to use some medical skills to torture someone without leaving behind any trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The food for officers and inmates were separated in the canteen, and the health standards for inmates were poorer. Black Leather was a publicly recognised boss, and his meal would be more sumptuous. Thus, the harmful bacteria accumulated in his stomach would continue to increase over time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Su Tao jabbed his Zhongwan Acupoint. It could be used to relieve intestine pain, but an expert like Su Tao could use it to damage the digestive system. When the immunity in Black Leather’s stomach lost balance, all the accumulated toxins formed into acute gastroenteritis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Su Tao couldn’t protect himself, he would have probably suffered by now. He might be a doctor, but he’s not a downright nice guy, especially after he just got betrayed by Miao Yugen. There was a fit of anger pent up in his heart, which Black Leather came to piss him off at this time. At the same time, Su Tao knew that as a boss in prison, Black Leather couldn’t be a good person, so he had given the latter some suffering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, never offend a divine physician. He can save lives, but he can also harm others without leaving any evidence.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the prison officers left, the prisoners knew that Su Tao had become the boss here. Since Su Tao had instructed them to do push-ups earlier, they immediately went into position without any further instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head in satisfaction, Su Tao shouted, “One!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inmates would all lower their bodies, and when he shouted “Two!” the inmates would grit their teeth as they pushed themselves up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lying on his bed, Su Tao looked at the ceiling and shouted. It was just like how he suffered insomnia as a child; he would count himself to sleep. But for some reason, he felt more energetic as he counted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would anyone be thinking about him at this moment? There’s probably a lot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’m sorry that I’m making all of you worry.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Su Tao blamed himself with guilt while feeling the sweetness in his heart.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing’s villa was still lit in the Golden Bay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting on the couch, Yan Jing looked at her phone with a grave expression. She was waiting for a call. Finally, the screen lit up and she answered, “How is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He has been sent to the third prison in the province, but it’s too late now, so I didn’t manage to find him. Please forgive me.” Tang Hu briefly paused before he continued, “But things aren’t as complicated as you’ve imagined. There seems to be another power helping him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Tang Hu was a chess piece that she had planted and his recent developments were pretty good, they were still inferior to her authority in Hanzhou. After all, Sichuan was far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who?” Yan Jing perplexedly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Lin Family of Sichuan Province.” Since he was someone who’d been in Sichuan for a long time, Tang Hu naturally had his own information network. “It seems that Huainan’s Sire Shui has personally given a call to the old man of the Lin Clan. But it’s late, so the order still hasn’t arrived.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Yan Jing instantly felt more relieved, so she replied, “Regardless if there’s another power trying to help Su Tao, you must save him quickly at all costs. I also hope that you can also find the person who framed him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief shock, Tang Hu reminded, “Big Sister Jing, we’ve prepared for years to enter Sichuan’s underworld. If you did this, I might be exposed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Yan Jing’s voice suddenly became soft, “Hu’zi, he’s important to my daughter and I.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words left Tang Hu shocked. He never expected that the Venomous Widow would reveal such an emotional side of her. He was touched and envious at the same time. He sighed at the fortune of Su Tao. In the eyes of others, Yan Jing was a demoness, but she was a loyal and trustworthy boss for her men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. I won’t let you down.” Tang Hu further replied, “I have brothers in the third prison, and I have already given out my orders. I guarantee that he won’t suffer in prison. As for getting him out, I will also do my best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she hung the call, Yan Jing sighed. She knew that Tang Hu must’ve been disappointed in her. However, she did not regret it, since Su Tao made her realise that life was worth living once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was once without anything, so she could disregard all consequences. But now, she had to weigh the matters and give up other stuff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it would disrupt her plans, and she might suffer a significant loss, she felt that it was all worth it.</span></p>
