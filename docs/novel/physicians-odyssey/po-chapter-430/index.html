 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? You’re in Beijing?” Kim Jung-yeon replied in disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had just finished her flight and she was pushing her luggage that was covered in all sorts of stickers. Her sunglasses were on her brown hair. She wore a red windbreaker with a shirt that had blue crystal embedded on the collar, a green and round hat along with white leggings and brown boots that made her look youthful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have something to do in Beijing. You can directly head to the Three Flavour Hall. Someone will help you settle down.” Su Tao helplessly explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had no idea why Kim Jung-yeon came over, he still had to act as the host since she has travelled such a long distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After tapping on her lips as she briefly pondered, Kim Jung-yeon shook her head. “No way, I’ll head over to Beijing and look for you. My Visa will expire soon, and I can’t stay here for long. But there are some pictures required for the fan club, and I have to look for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Helplessly sighing, Su Tao smiled. “Then, I’ll send you my address!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Kim Jung-yeon acknowledged, she smiled. “We already have 3,000 core members for our fan club, and the next step is to expand the range of influence. Please believe me, since I will surely support you into an outstanding celebrity doctor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed and was genuinely moved by Kim Jung-yeon’s actions, which he could basically describe her as a brain-dead fan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Truth be told, Su Tao felt a little elated, since many people in China chased after Korean celebrities, so it felt especially great that he could enjoy it the other way around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished with his call, Gu Rushan was waiting in the living room for a long time, which she grumbled when she looked at her watch. “It’s getting late, and I’ve already checked the map. It’s a dozen kilometers away from here, and according to the traffic here, it will be congested even if we take a cab.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao weakly smiled. “Give me ten minutes to prepare, and we can head over!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Gu Rushan had no other choice other than to wait patiently. Hearing the water splashing in the bathroom, she started to feel baffled. she had gradually gotten closer with this new neighbor of hers, and it’s so unlike her style.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although so many people tried to woo her, they were all rejected by her. Perhaps it was due to Su Tao being young, and he didn’t have any lethality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To save time, the two of them flagged a cab. By the time they arrived at the said location, Ni Jingqiu and her boyfriend, Huo Kun, had always been waiting for quite some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Kun saw Su Tao, he was first stunned, since he did not expect that his savior would be so young, before smiling as he looked at Su Tao’s medical box. “Welcome!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao modestly smiled. “I initially did not want to leave my name behind and be a nameless hero, and I never expected to be discovered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finding Su Tao humorous, Ni Jingqiu smiled. “It’s really a coincidence. I had some matters to do at the production team, and I never expected that your girlfriend would have an interview there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao smiled as he looked at Gu Rushan, who maintained a calm expression. At this moment, he finally understood the reason why Gu Rushan wanted him to pretend to be her boyfriend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Big Sister Jingqiu, for your help. The production team has already called me and told me that I’m hired!” Gu Rushan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at her in admiration, Ni Jingqiu replied, “From the feedback that I got from the production team, your initial performance was excellent, so you’ve practically relied on your own ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In any case, I still have to thank you!” Gu Rushan smiled, since she knew that if it wasn’t for Ni Jingqiu’s help, how could she possibly defeat that ‘internet celebrity face’ and obtain the role?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Ni Jingqiu examined Gu Rushan, she asked, “Oh, right. I’ve looked into you, and you don’t seem to have signed under any management company.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There were some companies that contacted me, but I rejected them as the terms were too harsh, and I can’t agree with their management style.” Gu Rushan smiled as she tried to conceal the awkwardness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words were half true as there were management companies that looked for her in the past, but those were to model at a car exhibit or wine reception. Although it was a fast route in earning money, she couldn’t accept the concept of selling her youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One must know how to sell themselves high so that you can receive respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Kun, here’s a chance for you!” Ni Jingqiu winked her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun was briefly stunned before he examined Gu Rushan and found her to have a unique temperament. Despite looking ordinary, she was the kind that was lasting to the eyes. He had seen all sorts of women in his management company, but someone like Gu Rushan was unique. Thus, he smiled. “I do own a management company, and you can sign with me if you don’t mind. I promise that you will be given the best treatment!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan never expected that happiness would come so quickly. But just when she wanted to agree to it, Su Tao’s voice resounded, “Regarding this matter, we still have to discuss it when we return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gu Rushan looked at Su Tao with a complicated gaze and noticed the flicker in his eyes, she soon realised what was going on. She couldn’t be too impulsive, since she still didn’t know anything about Huo Kun and Ni Jingqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s not a trivial matter to sign a management company, since it wouldn’t be easy for them to leave in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ni Jingqiu had already ordered the food, and despite Huo Kun appearing to be passionate, Su Tao could notice an indifference from him. After all, Huo Kun was unconscious when he saved him, and he had no idea how serious his condition was. Thus, Huo Kun did not regard him as important as Ni Jingqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun came from a wealthy family, and his excellent background told him that he must not forget a generous act. In his view, treating Su Tao to a meal and allowing Gu Rushan to soar into the sky was sufficient to repay for Su Tao’s help in saving him back at the park.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he never expected that Su Tao would refuse his goodwill, which made him feel embarrassed. Hence, his unpleasant mood was also shown in his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the sumptuous meal, the conversation in the room was a little cold, even with Ni Jingqiu’s attempt to alleviate the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Su, you’re a physician, so you must know traditional medical techniques like acupuncture, bone-setting, and massage, right?” Huo Kun felt that Su Tao was young, so he was casual with his form of addressing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was considered a famous physician in Huainan, and even a Major General like Jin Guoxiang had to be courteous to him. As the savior of Huo Kun, Su Tao felt a little disappointed that he would be treated with such negligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he wasn’t a narrow-minded person, and he did not feel that the latter must feel deeply grateful for his help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Kun’s tone made him feel uncomfortable. He noticed the doubts in Huo Kun’s words if he only managed to save him with luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know a lot, so I’ll not embarrass myself!” Su Tao briefly pondered and did not feel the need to bicker with Huo Kun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even so, Huo Kun did not let him off and smiled. “Seeing that you’re with your medical box, there should be quite a few treasures, right? Why don’t you show us a thing or two to widen our horizon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Ni Jingqiu felt that Huo Kun was a little rude, she still looked at Su Tao with curiosity. She wondered if he was really an expert like what the doctor said back then in the hospital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she looked at Su Tao curiously and asked, “Why don’t you look at me and see if there’s anything wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Placing down his chopsticks, Su Tao examined Ni Jingqiu for a long while before he sighed, “You do have something wrong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ni Jingqiu was initially joking around, but she never expected that Su Tao would really say that she’s sick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, she locked her brows together in perplexion and asked, “What’s wrong with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking out a piece of paper from his medical box, Su Tao wrote a few words on it before handing it over to Ni Jingqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the paper, Ni Jingqiu’s expression drastically changed, and her eyes were grave when she looked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her grave expression, Huo Kun asked, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing, I was only joking with her.” Su Tao explained on behalf of Ni Jingqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Kun knew that Ni Jingqiu and Su Tao must have some secrets, which he became curious about. But seeing that Su Tao wasn’t willing to disclose it, he became even more unhappy with Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the meal came to an end, Huo Kun and Ni Jingqiu sent Su Tao and Gu Rushan off before a sneer of disdain rose on Huo Kun’s lips as he turned to Ni Jingqiu. “I’ve accompanied them to a meal, as you’ve requested. Can I return to my company now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Kun, Su Tao is your savior, so why are you treating him in this manner?! Even if you’re not grateful for him, you shouldn’t be so rude to him!” Ni Jingqiu locked her brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Ni Jingqiu angered, Huo Kun immediately smiled. “I’m sorry, darling. I only can’t endure how he’s putting on airs by wearing a robe and really considering himself to be a divine physician.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it! Consider that I’ve done something stupid, then!” Ni Jingqiu sighed. She was helpless by Huo Kun’s attitude towards Su Tao. She initially thought that they could thank their savior, but she never expected that Huo Kun wasn’t into it and ruined it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Huo Kun, Ni Jingqiu felt that her boyfriend was good at every factor except for the fact that his life had been too smooth, and he offended many people with how aloof he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they hadn’t grown up together and the inter-marriage between their families, Ni Jingqiu really would have had to reconsider if she had made the right choice in her partner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was too late to regret as their marriage was already on the schedule, their newlywed house had also been renovated, and they’ve also sent invitations to their family and friends. Both their parents were influential figures, and this marriage could no longer be changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being a powerful woman in the eyes of many, she was still like every other girl who vexed over their marriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ni Jingqiu watched as Huo Kun entered his Porsche sports car and waved his hand in her direction before he left. After he left, she retrieved the paper that Su Tao gave her and her expression was unusual. She was full of admiration for Su Tao, since the latter managed to see through the hidden illness in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he wasn’t capable, how would he be able to make such an accurate diagnosis?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she got in her Maserati, she did not start her vehicle, but took out her phone and typed Su Tao into the search engine. However, the result of her search left her shocked!</span></p>
