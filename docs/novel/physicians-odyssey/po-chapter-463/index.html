 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng had a headache recently due to the crisis that the Medicine Deity Corporation was facing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three Flavour International sued the Medicine Deity Corporation, claiming that the Medicine Deity Corporation has violated rights in the formula of their products.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wang Guofeng was in Beijing, he still made the strategic decisions for the Medicine Deity Corporation. Under Rangure’s support, he gained complete control of the Medicine Deity Corporation. For the Medicine King Valley’s assets to fall in the hands of a disciple from the Medical Dao Sect, it could be considered an irony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the incident this time wasn’t the Medicine Deity Corporation trying to steal the Three Flavour International’s formula, but the few patents that the Three Flavour International registered were several popular products of the Medicine Deity Corporation, such as skincare, masks, and serum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To put it simply, the Three Flavour International analysed the vital component of the Medicine Deity Corporation and applied for patents, which they now gained the advantage in court.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the Medicine Deity Corporation now faced with a massive loss that they’re unable to sell several hot-selling products.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Ran’s complexion was unsightly as he said, “The Three Flavour International is too despicable!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">We</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;were the ones who created these products, and they actually applied for patents that put us in a vulnerable position.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the human heart. You could only try to snatch from someone, and they’re not allowed to snatch from you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng’s expression was grave as he sighed. Although the Three Flavour International was despicable, this was the business industry, and no one knew what their opponents might do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tapping his finger on the desk, Wang Guofeng instructed, “Firstly, contact the Three Flavour International and see if we can buy the patents back. Secondly, focus on getting the patents for our other hot-selling products. Lastly, take all the products that are involved in the infringement off the shelves, and we’ll deal with it after we resolve the lawsuit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Luo Ran replied with reluctance, “If we remove them from the shelves, then we will be facing a potential loss of tens of millions! They’re clearly our products, and we have to buy the patents from them? What logic is this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a snort, Wang Guofeng unhappily said, “Isn’t it because you guys have not paid attention to such details at the beginning, which is why we’re paying for our mistakes now?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The last two are still easy to handle, but do you think they will agree on the first one?” Luo Ran took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Three Flavour International and Medicine Deity Corporation were mortal enemies, and it’s practically impossible for them to buy back the patents from the Three Flavour International.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then we’ll use a high price to tempt them! People in business highly value money, and as long as we offer an appropriate price, we will definitely be able to tempt them. We have to get back the patents at all costs, or we can only abandon them to replace them with other products. But we will suffer a greater loss if we do that.” Wang Guofeng replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they continue to sell their products after the Three Flavour International obtained the patents, then they would only leave more evidence behind for the other party. If the court passes on a sentence, then those sales would be included in the compensation. After all, the logic applied to apples as well. If there’s a rotten part on the apple, you have to remove it quickly, or the entire apple will rot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wang Guofeng wasn’t trained for business, his mind was clear, and his decisions were considerate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the price that you think is appropriate for the patents?” Luo Ran probed. He needed to know the price so that he would know how to handle the negotiation with the Three Flavour International.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“¥20,000,000!” Wang Guofeng helplessly said, then continued, “Those products only earn us about ¥20,000,000 annually, and if the patents exceed the price, then there’s no point in us taking them back. We would rather use the money to repackage other products.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Ran was stunned before he subconsciously licked his dried lips and said with his heart aching, “Then, doesn’t that mean that we’ve given them our profits for a year?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furrowing his brows together, Wang Guofeng helplessly responded, “You should pray that they will agree to it. Otherwise, we will face an even greater loss if they sue us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll make an arrangement immediately!” Luo Ran sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Luo Ran left, Wang Guofeng locked his brows together. He had been caught off guard by the Three Flavour International’s sudden retaliation. Although the Medicine Deity Corporation managed to avoid the public criticism from the statement that they released, Su Tao’s revenge was as strong as ever, which gave him a resounding slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a paper alone had cost the Medicine Deity Corporation a potential loss of at least ¥20,000,000!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, Luo Ran returned and helplessly shook his head. “I’ve contacted the Three Flavour International, and they’ve rejected our request.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Locking his brows together, Wang Guofeng knocked his finger on the desk and instructed, “Try to contact them a few more times. We’re already in a passive position, so we can only bow our heads.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Luo Ran sighed, he left the room once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the door was knocked again, Wang Guofeng yelled out in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the response had a charming voice, “It seems like our Chairman Wang is in a terrible mood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng was shocked before he looked at the visitor, Rangure. He gave a self-ridiculing smile and commented, “I’m only trying to mend the mistakes that I’ve done!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already know what’s going on!” Rangure swept a glance at Wang Guofeng and continued, “There’s a huge difference between the management level of the Medicine Deity Corporation and the Three Flavour International. The Medicine Deity Corporation has already obtained the approval for the listing application, and it’s currently in the silent period. Not only did you guys violate the rules and issued a statement, you guys even created such grave negative news. Now, the listing is being delayed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re already trying to amend it. If we can buy back the patents, we will be able to reduce the negative news to the minimum.” Wang Guofeng helplessly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking her finger, Rangure suggested, “Don’t try to beg your competitor since you will only fall into more traps.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, what should I do?” Wang Guofeng couldn’t help feeling relieved when he heard Rangure’s words, since he knew her ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me introduce you to someone. With his strength, I believe that he can easily resolve this matter.” Rangure winked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Wang Guofeng could no longer remain seated. He became emotional. “Then, please introduce me to him!”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an ancient teahouse located in the north of Beijing, it’s situated in the southwest corner of the commercial street. Two men were sitting in a private room on the third floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the men wore a traditional costume with a fan in his hand. Although he appeared to be in his early thirties, his dressing was extremely traditional. On the other hand, the other man had thick brows, large eyes, a square face, and a sharp nose. He had the typical look of an ambitious person from novels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man in traditional costume was Tong Zuoqing, who was often known as Imperial Uncle, while the square-faced man was Qin Jingyu of China’s Elite Ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is the person that you’re recommending reliable?” Qin Jingyu proficiently brewed tea with steam permeating from the tea set when he poured hot water over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tong Zuoqing sighed when he saw Qin Jingyu’s skill. He could determine the experience of the latter’s proficient movements. Compared to him, the waitresses here were lacking. He smiled. “Brother Jingyu, don’t you trust me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a straightforward smile, Qin Jingyu shook his head. “Why would I not trust you? But I’ve also investigated that person called Wang Guofeng. He has lost to Su Tao several times, and since I’m asking you for a solution, I naturally want someone capable and not a failure.” When he finished, he poured tea into a cup and handed it over to Tong Zuoqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking a sip of the tea, Tong Zuoqing was blown away by the taste and patiently explained, “It’s called coming back up from where you fall! According to my understanding, this Wang Guofeng hates Su Tao to his bones, and a person like him is easy to control.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Jingyu first smiled before he sighed, “I don’t need him to die; I just want him to back off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since ancient times, heroes have often been prisoners of love! I understand, but please be reassured. I will handle this matter for you.” Tong Zuoqing stood up and brewed a cup of tea for Qin Jingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the know-it-all in Beijing, Tong Zuoqing knew Qin Jingyu’s intention. The reason why no one dared to pursue the princess of the Shui Family was partly due to her status, since there weren’t many that could match up to her. The other reason why was because everyone knew that Qin Jingyu had feelings for Shui Junzhuo, and no one wanted to offend the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Tong Zuoqing was surprised that an outsider had offended Qin Jingyu, who has given a death sentence to Su Tao in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A brief moment later, Wang Guofeng followed behind Rangure as they entered. His gaze fell onto Qin Jingyu with surprise. Even if he’s not in Beijing’s circle, he has heard the fame of the famous Young Master Qin. Thus, he immediately greeted with a smile on his face, “I’m really surprised to meet Young Master Qin here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Qin Jingyu smiled. “I don’t like to beat around the bush. I got Imperial Uncle to ask you out because I want to be friends with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s definitely my honor!” Wang Guofeng immediately smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Qin Jingyu smiled and said, “I know that your company has encountered some troubles recently, and I’m willing to resolve it for you. However, I have a condition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Wang Guofeng’s heart sank since he knew that nothing comes free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But seeing his hesitation, Qin Jingyu smiled. “Don’t worry, I won’t force you. I just hope that you can help me deal with a person who you are also familiar with — Su Tao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Qin Jingyu’s request, a smile immediately rose on Wang Guofeng’s lips and he straightforwardly agreed, “So that’s the matter. Su Tao and I are mortal enemies, and even if he doesn’t come looking for me, I won’t let him go so easily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Qin Jingyu smiled, he took out his phone and made a call in a solemn voice, “Mr. Meng? I have something that I would like to ask of you. A friend of mine has recently encountered some trouble in his company. His competitor snatched his patent. He’s currently facing a crisis of being sued, and I need your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jingyu, I will definitely handle the matter since it’s coming from you. Get your friend to find me. As long as he can provide substantial evidence, I will handle it for him.” Mr. Meng smiled and straightforwardly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that, Wang Guofeng inwardly sighed in his heart. He never expected that the trouble that was worth ¥20,000,000 and has been bothering him for a long time would be resolved by Qin Jingyu with just a phone call.</span></p>
