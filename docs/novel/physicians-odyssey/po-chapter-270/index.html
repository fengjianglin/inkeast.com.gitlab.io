 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took half an hour for Miao Yurong to reach his cousin’s house. It was akin to heaven and earth when comparing his tattered home to Miao Yugen’s house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Yugen’s house was a three-story villa decorated with glazed roof tiles. There were two sculptures of dragons on the roof that looked dominating. Although it was already 8 p.m. and most villagers were resting, Miao Yugen’s house was still lit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Miao Yurong yelled, his holler instantly attracted the barking of dogs, which terrified him. A few minutes later, Miao Yugen walked out with his wife, Liu Ye and smiled. “So it’s Yurong, why are you here so late in the night?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Liu Ye had no favorable opinion of Miao Yurong. After all, everyone in the village knew that he was useless, and his wife ran away with their daughter. So it’s certainly nothing good for that fellow to come at this timing. She was a vanity woman, so she knew that Miao Yurong definitely had something to ask of her husband. This was how people were; they would often want to flaunt themselves once they’re successful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Liu Ye would wear a bright smile the more she loathed Miao Yurong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whenever Miao Yurong looked at Liu Ye, he would sigh in his heart. Back then, this woman paled in comparison with Fan Lihua when she married over, but along with Miao Yugen’s successful career, she was akin to a flower that bloomed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have something to ask of Yugen!” Miao Yurong did not dare to look at Liu Ye and lowered his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the sense of inferiority in Miao Yurong, Liu Ye felt pleased. When Miao Yurong married Fan Lihua, the village spread that Miao Yurong was so fortunate to have such a beauty like Fan Lihua as his wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the end? She was now the beauty in Miao Village, while Fan Lihua had been turned into an old woman from being poor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s a phrase in the city&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">—</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;there are no ugly women, but only those that are lazy to doll themselves up. Liu Ye knew that her foundation wasn’t good, so she had invested in herself when Miao Yugen became rich. Such had undergone the knife to make her chin sharper, her nose bridge higher, and even paid more attention to her makeup. This was the reason why she had undergone a drastic change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are guests in the house. I’ll bring you to the study room.” Liu Ye didn’t find Miao Yurong hateful anymore when she basked in the satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Yugen was living a good life and even had his own study room. This was the taste of the rich. When Miao Yurong followed behind Liu Ye, he gulped down saliva, wondering how it would feel to stay at this house for a night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Fan Lihua sneaked out with their daughter, Miao Yurong never had a proper life. Without anyone caring for him, his life became even more rotten. He even quit his job and became a bum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how Miao Yurong dragged his feet as he looked around in curiosity, Liu Ye snickered in her heart. If it was a few years ago, before Miao Yugen became wealthy, she might be willing to talk to Miao Yurong. But her status was no longer the same, and her eyesight was much higher. In her eyes, Miao Yurong was nothing but useless trash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s Yugen seeing today?” Miao Yurong rubbed his hand as he probed, “How long do I have to wait to see him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A foreigner that came to play!” Liu Ye brewed a cup of tea for Miao Yurong, and naturally, it wasn’t any expensive tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had walked such a long distance, Miao Yurong also felt thirsty, so he took a sip and sighed, “Yugen is having such a good life now. He even built connections with foreigners?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the eyes of Miao Village, foreigners were not only mysterious, but they also represented power. There was a saying that foreigners were all wealthy, and just giving you some tips could ensure your life without worries. Thus, foreign guests had undoubtedly held a high position in Miao Yugen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had such a good life, his wife wouldn’t have left him, and how would he become the joke of the village today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving her hand, Liu Ye explained, “It’s mainly because Yugen has a good relationship with Mr. Xuan of the Baitan Town. That foreigner is a businessman who wants to invest in Baitan Town, so Mr. Xuan got Yugen to receive the foreigner.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his thumb, Miao Yugen praised, “Yugen is doing better and better now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Liu Ye saw Miao Yurong’s hand in his pocket and smiled. “Is it a little cold? I’ll turn on the air conditioner!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Yurong had seen air conditioners on the television. He saw how Liu Ye applied nail polish as she pressed on the remote, a beep instantly resounded and warm air blew out that left Miao Yurong in admiration again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An air conditioner was costly, and they also required a lot of electricity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This air conditioner was bought last year, and it’s eco-saving. So it won’t waste too much electricity.” Liu Ye explained. She had guessed Miao Yurong’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh! How comfortable!” Miao Yurong replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Liu Ye was basking in satisfaction from Miao Yurong’s admiration. She had gone through a tough life, and Miao Yugen’s current achievement was also related to her. If she hadn’t been so good at playing along, how would Miao Yugen have such achievements today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was chatting with Miao Yurong, she wasn’t bothered about the matters of the Miao Village. She had already considered half of herself as someone from the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a voice yelled out, and Liu Ye left. A brief moment later, Miao Yugen came in and gave a cigarette to his cousin and smiled. “So, why did you come looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having his head hung low, Miao Yurong explained the entire situation and even exaggerated the matter. “Fuck, how can I tolerate having my mother and me being beaten?! It’s still because Second Uncle is helping the outsiders!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Miao Yugen heard about Second Uncle, he locked his brows together. “Hmph, Second Uncle is already getting on his age, and yet he still likes to dip his fingers in other people’s business!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Yurong knew that Miao Yugen had some grudges with Second Uncle. Back then, when Miao Yugen stole from the village treasury, he was discovered by Second Uncle and was nearly beaten to death. Thus, he continued to fan the fire, “Looking at Second Uncle’s opinion, I’m afraid he’s going to sell the mountain in the village to that outsider!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Miao Yurong had no idea that he had guessed half of it correctly by luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Smacking his hand on his thigh, Miao Yugen cursed, “Miao Zhongtian, that son of a bitch! Why is he the one making the decisions? I’m planning to take all of Miao Village’s mountain into a sourcing ground of a Stone Factory!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Miao Yugen’s words, Miao Yurong instantly rejoiced. “Big Brother Yugen, you’re going to set up a factory in Miao Village?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Yugen knitted his brows and coughed, “I’m just a supervisor in Jintian Village’s Stone Factory, but I don’t want to work for others my entire life. Now that I’ve saved up money, I’m planning to set up my own!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, can I work for you?” Miao Yurong asked in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staring at his cousin, Miao Yurong felt that it was an excellent opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure! You’re my cousin, and I need someone that I can trust in the new factory, so you’re one of my choices. However, you can’t be a bum like you are now when you’re in the Stone Factory.” Miao Yugen was briefly stunned. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t introduced a job for Miao Yurong, but the latter was just a good-for-nothing. But after considering it now, he felt that he could make use of Miao Yurong to obtain the mountain and continued, “I’ve already understood the matter. Don’t worry, I will get someone to chase the outsiders out tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will surely not let you down, and I will work hard!” Miao Yurong immediately stood up, since it was getting late. Bowing to Miao Yugen, he continued, “Cousin, thank you for your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he was sent out, Miao Yurong was disappointed, since it wasn’t Liu Ye who sent him out. On his trip back, he was feeling butterflies in the stomach. His mind was filled with Miao Yugen’s promises and the latter’s house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After watching Miao Yurong leave, Miao Yugen lit up a cigarette before looking at his villa. Although there were windows, the lights in the room still pierced through the window, and it was dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been working so hard to become an authoritative figure in Miao Village now, and he was no longer a frog in a well. When he came in contact with the outside world, he realised how childish he had been.

 <p>Sigh... cowards that had to sell their wife for money...</p>
 <p>For you guys to know, most of Asia's countries generally have a lower minimum wage compared to western countries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lemme give you guys an example, I once worked as a waiter in the past while schooling to earn some part-time cash, and they were paying around $6/hour ~$4.41 USD. And I once received tips of $100, which is equivalent to 2 days of my salary.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, I heard that some countries have a minimum wage of about USD$7-8 ~$10 after converted into Singapore dollars, which is easily the starting salary for a fresh university graduate in Singapore.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>So if anyone is wondering why is he turning on the A/C if it's cold, most A/C have a heater function built-in. So instead of dispensing cold air, there's a setting for it to blow out hot air instead.</p>
