 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wang Guofeng sang Jonathan Lee’s Men’s Thirty, his voice was robust and filled with emotions that invited applause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Returning to his seat, Huo Kun gave him a thumbs up and whispered in his ears, “Young Master Feng is truly Young Master Feng. You’re not called a lady killer for nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng humbly waved his hand and smiled. “With our relationship, I don’t think we need to flatter each other. You spoke through the phone that you have something that you’d like to ask me, and I wonder if we can talk about it now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun nodded his head and waved his hand towards everyone else. “You guys go next door for a brief moment. I have something to talk to Young Master Feng about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he was the bankroller today, everyone stood up and headed for the room next door after turning off the karaoke system. Instantly, the room fell into silence and Huo Kun’s glance fell onto Ling Yu with hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing through his thoughts, Wang Guofeng smiled. “My Junior Brother isn’t the kind to spout secrets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling relieved, Huo Kun lowered his voice, “I visited the hospital a few days ago and nearly lost my life. I invited you over because I would like you to take a look at me and see if I’m suffering from any terminal illness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the dim lights in the room, Wang Guofeng couldn’t see Huo Kun’s complexion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he stood up and turned on the light before glancing at Huo Kun’s complexion. Then he turned to Ling Yu. “Have you noticed anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I still have to take his pulse!” Ling Yu smiled and nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng turned to Huo Kun and explained, “I’m already not providing any treatment, but my Junior Brother is skillful, so let him take a look at you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew his grandfather’s temper, and if his grandfather knew that he had treated someone, he would surely be chased out of the household. Hence, he had been cautious on this matter and did not dare to cross it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Kun had his doubts, since he believed in Wang Guofeng’s medical skills more, he still stretched his hand out after hearing Wang Guofeng’s promotion of Ling Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yu locked his brows together. Huo Kun’s pulse was more complicated than he had imagined. Despite a clog in his heart, there’s a surge of hidden energy in his body that allowed Huo Kun’s blood to circulate in his body normally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From TCM’s angle, Huo Kun’s body was in a terrible state, and it’s not an understatement to say that his life was hanging by a thread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he was still alive was due to the hidden energy in his body. Otherwise, there’s a high possibility that he might suffer a chronic heart arrest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a breath, Ling Yu said, “If I’ve not guessed incorrectly, you must have fainted three days ago while jogging.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing such an accurate speculation, Huo Kun’s eyes lit up and he immediately said, “Yeah, I was even in the hospital for an entire day. According to the doctor, I was suffering from chronic heart arrest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did anyone perform emergency treatment for you?” Ling Yu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, Huo Kun was shocked as he replied in excitement, “That’s right! There was a young physician that conducted emergency treatment on me before the ambulance arrived.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile rose on Ling Yu’s lips as he replied, “Then you have to thank that young physician. If it wasn’t for him, then you couldn’t still be sitting here. Furthermore, your illness still hasn’t been treated, and you’re merely relying on a breath that he replenished for you to maintain your current state. Once the breath is exhausted, then there’s a chance of you having another chronic heart arrest again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Huo Kun widened his mouth and was shocked beyond words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng knew that Ling Yu’s diagnosis skills have already reached the legendary Detailed Realm. Although he did not take Huo Kun’s pulse himself, he could tell from Huo Kun’s complexion that the latter was suffering from a grave illness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to worry about it. Since my Junior Brother is here, then he can naturally treat you.” Wang Guofeng smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun finally felt relieved and he wryly smiled. “Then I’ll have to trouble the two of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Kun did not feel grateful for Su Tao. On the contrary, he felt rage burning in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was his logic. Since Su Tao had saved him back then, then why didn’t Su Tao save him completely and leave such a tail behind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying goes, save people to the end. Hence, Su Tao was either incapable, or he intended to use this to threaten him and Ni Jingqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun’s way of thinking was a little unusual. Su Tao did not have any equipment with him when he performed the emergency treatment back then. When they met again, he had also thought of treating Huo Kun, but the latter’s arrogant attitude made Su Tao unhappy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a doctor, it’s a principle that doctors never knock on the patient’s door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing a patient like Huo Kun, Su Tao wouldn’t cross his bottom line to snub up to the former to treat him unless absolutely necessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People like Huo Kun weren’t rare. They considered themselves to be the center of the world and felt that everyone should revolve around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao saved Huo Kun, but the latter only felt that it was proper and to be expected as a matter of course, and it would be enough if he gave Su Tao some favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun was arrogant and he wasn’t the type to casually place his trust in others. Since he grew up with Wang Guofeng, he treated the latter with such importance since he knew how popular the Wang Family’s pharmacy was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But strictly speaking, that respect wasn’t direct at Wang Guofeng’s medical skills, but the Wang Family’s celebrated position in Beijing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Wang Guofeng has acknowledged Ling Yu’s strength, then Huo Kun naturally wouldn’t doubt it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like Su Tao, Ling Yu had a habit of carrying his medical box around with him. He took out his needles and performed acupuncture for Huo Kun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The acupuncture technique of the Medical Dao Sect was by using the Rising Dawn Qi to clear up the patient’s meridians. Acupuncture was their primary skill, while they used other methods to supplement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Pellet was also one of the Medical Dao Sect’s inheritance, which was the reason why outstanding disciples in the sect were also proficient in manufacturing pellets; this was the most significant benefit of a sect. The moment you become a member of the Medical Dao Sect, you would be qualified to seek medicine from the sect. Grandmasters created those medicines in the sect, and the effects were superb. Even if your medical skills were lacking, you could use those medicines as a supplement to treat some complicated illnesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ling Yu used acupuncture, he chose to insert his needles in the Fengchi, Baihui, Yintang, Hegu, Renzhong, Anmian, and Taichong Acupoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From TCM’s angle, the chronic heart arrest was also known as fainting with their limbs turning cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This condition was mainly caused by severe clogging in their blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yu’s acupuncture was akin to performing maintenance for a vehicle by adding oil to the parts and tightening the screws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly half an hour later, Ling Yu removed the needles and ended his acupuncture session. As Huo Kun let out a heavy breath, he felt his entire body being lightened and knew that Ling Yu’s acupuncture had taken effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing to the side, Wang Guofeng silently nodded his head. Ling Yu’s acupuncture technique had reached a high level that wasn’t inferior to his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he was also feeling complicated in his heart as there’s a feeling of him being replaced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Guofeng did not feel jealous, since he couldn’t treat any patients now, and the Medical Dao Sect needed a successor. Hence, Ling Yu’s talent was a piece of good news for the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After retrieving a white bottle, Ling Yu handed it over to Huo Kun. “There are a total of seven pellets in this bottle. When you wake up in the morning, drink a cup of water first before swallowing the pellet two minutes later. It will take effect a week from now, and if you watch your diet and lifestyle, you won’t suffer any relapse in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You mean it will still relapse in the future?” Huo Kun asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yu smiled as he explained, “When an ordinary person suffers from the flu, will they never experience the flu ever again after taking medicine? Your heart pulse is injured, and it’s related to your lifestyle. So if you don’t take good care of yourself, it will occur again as soon as three to five years, and as long as ten years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Huo Kun’s face turned grave as he sighed, “Thank you for your guidance!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Ling Yu continued, “Help the dying and healing the injured is the natural calling of doctors. But I suggest you leave as soon as possible to rest; it will be beneficial to your body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But!” Huo Kun looked at the time, and it’s still early. Was he going to end his night so soon?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wang Guofeng stood up and gently patted Huo Kun’s shoulder. “Health is of the utmost importance in life. I’m grateful for your host today, but we will have to take our leave. You should rest early as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng felt that Ling Yu’s reminder for Huo Kun was tactful, since the latter’s condition was a result of his unhealthy lifestyle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staying up late for a long time and participating in all sorts of wild parties has exhausted Huo Kun’s vitality, which was the reason why his heart pulse was akin to an old man at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bottle that Ling Yu gave Huo Kun wasn’t cheap, and it had a miraculous effect on those with heart conditions. Wang Guofeng inwardly sighed. Ling Yu was probably only so generous for his sake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they left the clubhouse, the two of them started to discuss Huo Kun’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, do you know who saved Huo Kun?” Ling Yu’s expression turned grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who?” Wang Guofeng’s tone sank as he asked, “Could it be other young experts from the sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao!” Ling Yu said in a grave tone as he explained, “If it wasn’t for Su Tao leaving a strand of Qi behind in Huo Kun’s body, he would have already died by now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you certain that it’s him?” Wang Guofeng asked, feeling bewildered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a bitter smile, Ling Yu replied, “His Qi is unique. Although it’s not especially powerful, it’s endless, and the unique point is much more evident than any other physician’s Qi. Furthermore, it could be easily inserted into the five viscera and six bowels to conceal it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng had researched Su Tao numerous times, and the reason why the Heavenseizing Hands were called the Saint Hands of Xing Lin lied in this factor. He never expected that Ling Yu managed to discover it from treating Huo Kun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Know thyself, know thy enemy.” Wang Guofeng smiled. “I believe that you can create a miracle and defeat Su Tao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ling Yu did not speak and gave a faint smile in the direction to Wang Guofeng. He knew that the grudge between his Senior Brother and Su Tao was too deep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Daoist School’s Medical Skill had influenced him, so he had his own system of values. Act according to his heart, and not be affected by the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could tell that Wang Guofeng has been trying to incite disharmony, but he wasn’t willing to clash with his Senior Brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having a mild character and being ready to adapt by taking action through inaction ⁠— Ling Yu’s mentality was several levels above Wang Guofeng!</span></p>
