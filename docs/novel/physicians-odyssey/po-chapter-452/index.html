 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao did not know that a plot was brewing against him. He was still focused on preparing for the National Healer Selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he did not expect that because of his blank origin, he would encounter a setback in the first phrase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the National Healer Selection’s rules, there would be an examination phase within two weeks after the application was filed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The examination was the same as other examinations, with the candidates’ backgrounds being investigated. Furthermore, it was stricter since they would investigate the candidates’ families.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If your family had an oversea experience, a criminal record, involved in gambling, drug-taking, or was involved in major diseases, the candidates would have their qualifications eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s résumé was simple, so there was nothing to be investigated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His grandfather, Su Guangsheng, was an ordinary physician in Hanzhou City who accumulated positive public praise. His parents passed away in an accident twenty years ago, leaving him behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing that cannot be explained was his missing background for the past ten years, in which the examination committee fell into a dilemma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the committee gave Su Tao a call for him to prepare information for that. Although he had the Shui Family acting as his guarantor, he still had to make an explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason for that was simple, every National Healer Grandmaster would serve senior officials. For those in ancient times, any problem that arose would result in their assets being confiscated, and family exterminated. Even in modern times, they would also be implicated in jail sentences. Thus, no one dared to be negligent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with Sire Shui and Sire Cao acting as guarantors, Su Tao still had to make an explanation for his history to prove his qualification to participate in the National Healer Selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao couldn’t be truthful about his history and could only come up with a lie. He explained that he spent ten years in a remote village, and due to his parent’s passing, he grew up with his aunt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was only a formality, the committee did make an investigation and discovered that Su Tao did have an aunt that he had no blood relations with. She was an adopted daughter of Su Guangsheng and remained single throughout her lifetime and was also a famous female divine physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that resolved, he soon encountered another setback when he received a call from Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s a problem! Are you home right now?” Shui Junzhuo solemnly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am!” Su Tao replied in perplexion as he locked his brows together. But he soon noticed that Shui Junzhuo was outside his apartment, so he went and opened the door for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo rushed in and saw Kim Jung-yeon typing on the keyboard in the smaller bedroom. She then sighed and wryly smiled. “I need an explanation. Why is there a woman here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Shui Junzhuo’s character, it’s impossible for her to act out in this manner, even if she was jealous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Su Tao furrowed his brows and bitterly smiled. “She came over from South Korea a few days ago, and you should know that she’s the administrator behind my fan club. So I can’t possibly keep her out, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like you still have no idea about how serious this matter has become.” Shui Junzhuo took out her phone and tapped on the screen before passing it over to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While looking at her phone, Su Tao soon locked his brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Famous Physician, Su Tao, is staying together with a Korean girl?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The biggest joke about boycotting South Korea! China’s Physician King has fallen to a Korean girl’s skirt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Physician King Su Tao is a supporter of South Koreans with assets in South Korea!</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many such similar articles with crude content that was practically calling Su Tao a traitor to his country and that he supported South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only does he have a fan base in South Korea, he even has a medical center there and is staying with a South Korean lady, Kim Jung-yeon. Although he seemed to be loyal, he actually harbors evil intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reading those articles, Su Tao soon figured out the seriousness of this situation and couldn’t help sighing. He never expected that he would be defamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those articles had pictures serving as proof, which included the photo of Su Tao and Kim Jung-yeon entering the same apartment, screenshots of a Korean section in Su Tao’s international fan base, and the Three Flavour Hall’s plaque on South Korea’s medical center from when Kim Jung-ho lost to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire country was boycotting South Korea right now, so anyone that’s involved in this controversy would be bashed online.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao was filled with indignance as he bitterly smiled. He previously fought with Kim Jung-ho to fight for TCM’s dignity, but he never thought that he would become a public enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These aren’t true!” Su Tao bitterly smiled, while feeling powerless. That’s because the public didn’t know the truth; they’re all being misled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had experienced the power of the internet for the very first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know!” Shui Junzhuo also felt furious. She was more understanding than anyone about how much effort Su Tao put in to fight TKM, fighting for the dignity of China’s culture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao gradually calmed down. “We have to find the source of the news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve already found it; it came from a media company that has German shares. This matter has blown up with a huge troll army, and the public is being misled.” Shui Junzhuo sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, the figure of Rangure appeared in Su Tao’s mind, so he replied, “This should have something to do with Wang Guofeng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Shui Junzhuo was baffled before she took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Medicine Deity Corporation and Three Flavour International are competitors, and Wang Guofeng is now the Chairman of the Medicine Deity Corporation. Starting from last year, the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company has started to invest in the Medicine Deity Corporation. If my reputation is ruined, then Three Flavour International’s brand will be affected and they will be the biggest winner.” Su Tao calmly analysed and continued, “The Medical Dao Sect has also sent Ling Yu to participate in the National Healer Selection, and if I lose the qualification, that means that Ling Yu will become a National Healer. Hence, Wang Guofeng is vicious to use this move. But you don’t have to be too worried, I’m clean, and I don’t have to be guilty of it. As long as I do my part, I believe that everything will be cleared up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao with a complicated glance, Shui Junzhuo initially wanted to tell him that she’s going to use the Shui Family’s resources to resolve this matter for Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao already had his own decisions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Shui Junzhuo was about to speak, she was interrupted by Su Tao, “No need! I believe that I can deal with this matter. I know that the Shui Family can easily erase such fake news, but I don’t want to keep asking you for help. After all, I owe the Shui Family too much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do we have to be so distinct about it?” Shui Junzhuo felt that her words sounded a little wrong, so she immediately explained with her face blushed, “You saved my grandfather, and even saved Grandpa Cao. In terms of grace, we owe you more!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Su Tao replied, “I treated them because it’s my duty as a doctor, and I’ve also received my fees for that. It’s like farmers; if you ate the food that they grow, are you going to be eternally grateful to them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo’s face blushed even further before she shook her head. “How can this be compared to that? Farming doesn’t take much skill, and it’s something that everyone knows. However, a good doctor is rare, and not everyone can treat any illnesses like you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao had to admit that Shui Junzhuo’s reply did make him feel happy. However, he still remained indifferent and smiled. “You don’t have to interfere in this matter. When I’m truly at my wits’ end, I will come look for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing Su Tao being so persistent, Shui Junzhuo could only give up. However, she decided to help Su Tao if the matter goes out of control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s still a week before the examination ends.” Shui Junzhuo reminded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll resolve this matter swiftly.” Su Tao had to immediately contact Yan Jing, who was back at Hanzhou City, and resolve this matter.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did Rangure help blow up the matter, he even made use of his company’s public relations to fan the fire, instantly causing Su Tao to be in the headlines.</span></p>
