<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If others knew that Sire Shui was actually willing to go this far to nurture a young man, they would probably go insane from jealousy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Sire Shui was more open-minded about it since he owed Su Tao favour. Not to mention that he had also taken a fancy to both Su Tao’s character and medical skills. Although there wasn’t any history on Su Tao, Sire Shui was satisfied with Su Tao’s actions after he returned to Hanzhou City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Su Tao also had his own flaw of being too fickle when it came to relationships. However, he was an experienced person, so he knew that outstanding men would always have no lack of beautiful women around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s medical skills had won Sire Shui over, and the latter felt that such superb medical skills shouldn’t be buried in the sand. The nation required a talent like Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Dingjun was a good friend of Sire Shui, and he was someone who’s still active in many fields. Thus, his words and actions could affect many industries. If something happened to someone like him, then it was a significant loss for society. It was just that Cao Dingjun had a weird temper and disliked doctors; regardless of TCM or western medicine. The moment he finds out that the other party was a doctor, he would instantly flare-up. This was also why the Cao Family was helpless and had to seek help from Sire Shui to try and convince the stubborn Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Cao Dingjun’s current status, only someone like Sire Shui could convince him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Understanding his old friend’s character, Sire Shui could only play some tricks. He went over especially to Minnan Province and performed the Pulse Art before Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As someone with a passion for martial arts, Cao Dingjun’s interest was instantly piqued in the Pulse Art after witnessing Sire Shui performing it. Thus, Sire Shui gave him a foreshadowing to introduce him to Su Tao when there’s an opportunity. However, Cao Dingjun had no idea that Su Tao was a physician, and simply considered Su Tao to be a martial artist. This was how Sire Shui bluffed his way through and gave Su Tao a chance to meet with Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao heard of Sire Shui’s arrangements, he gave a wry smile. TCM emphasised that doctors did not knock on the patient’s door, and Sire Shui’s actions have clearly violated this rule. However, Su Tao could only agree to it since he has received numerous amounts of help from Sire Shui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, Miao Village’s adventure came to an end, for the time being. Although Su Tao did not manage to find the cloud grass, he obtained quite a bit of harvest. Aside from finding many wild herbs, he also found a wild fleece flower and a 100-year-old ginseng. Adding all of it together, the worth has exceeded ¥700,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Jingjing has gained great insight from this event. Su Tao had given her a perfect example of applying what you’ve learned in real life. Despite memorising the Synopsis of Golden Chamber’s Prescription and Compendium of Medical Herbs 1596, she was no different from a blind man when she climbed the mountain. However, Su Tao had grasped everything and even knew where the herbs grew. This was the reason why he managed to find so many precious herbs, and this wasn’t something that an ordinary person could achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she has decided to study the Compendium of Medical Herbs 1596 once more. Not only did she have to know the effects, shapes, scents and prescriptions of every single herb, she also had to learn their natural growing habitats. She realised that it was beneficial to understanding the effects of those herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In such a rural place like Miao Village, divorce was a huge matter. However, Miao Yurong had gone too far, so Fan Lihua managed to get the divorce procedure done under the support of Miao Zhongtian, the Village Chief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Fan Lihua, it was a relief to her. However, she did not feel good about it. They shared a bed for a decade, and Miao Doudou was the product of their relationship. Although Miao Yurong was human trash, it would be a lie to say that she had no feelings for him. On the way to the airport, Xiao Jingjing sat beside Fan Lihua and comforted the latter. Fan Lihua also secretly wiped her tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone had already brought the plane tickets for Xiao Jingjing, Fan Lihua, and Liu Jianwei to go back to Jiangnan Province, while Su Tao and Shui Junzhuo headed to Minnan Province to visit Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao stepped into the airport terminal first, which Xiao Jingjing looked at his silhouette with a complicated gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jingjing, you should learn how to take the initiative. Otherwise, he might be snatched away.” Everyone in the Three Flavour Hall knew about Xiao Jingjing’s feelings. Fan Lihua had a good impression of Xiao Jingjing, who was kind and passionate. However, she was just too ordinary when compared to Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lowering her head, Xiao Jingjing replied, “Big Sister Shui is a good person, and I can tell that she’s serious about Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words made Fan Lihua sigh. She knew that Xiao Jingjing had lost her confidence to compete with Shui Junzhuo. Thus, she encouraged her, “Are your feelings for Physician Su fake? Listen to me. You should try and fight for it. Otherwise, Physician Su will be taken away, sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking her head, Xiao Jingjing gave a self-ridiculing smile. “Aside from Big Sister Shui, there’s also Big Sister Yan. They’re both outstanding women, and they can help Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Xiao Jingjing being silly, Fan Lihua jabbed her on the head and sighed, “Aren’t you outstanding as well? Listen to me. You must not give up. In life, encountering a man that you fancy isn’t easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Biting her lips, Xiao Jingjing hesitated before she took out her phone and edited her message for a long time before she finally sent it. “Master, stay safe and return early.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her message was soon replied by Su Tao, “Take care of everyone in the Three Flavour Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xiao Jingjing saw the message, the depressed feelings in her heart instantly disappeared. She felt that she wasn’t a nobody in Su Tao’s heart. She was Su Tao’s Senior Disciple, and when Su Tao wasn’t around, the entire Three Flavour Hall would fall on her shoulders. Thus, she must manage the Three Flavour Hall well, inside and out.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the vehicle stopped, a well-dressed staff member walked over and respectfully opened the door. He waited for the guest to come out before opening the front door. Walking out of the vehicle, Bai Fan tossed the key over to the staff member and passed a red bill over. Seeing the red bill, the staff member immediately thanked him, knowing that he met a tycoon today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Bai, the air around you is getting stronger.” Wang Guofeng praised with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Patting Wang Guofeng’s shoulder, Bai Fan removed his sunglasses and replied, “Money is earned to be spent. The sales of our Medicine Deity Corporation is pretty good recently. Have you checked your account? The dividends have already reached seven digits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve not checked it.” Wang Guofeng smiled as he continued, “I’m used to living a frugal life, and I have no idea how to spend the money you gave me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Bai Fan teased, “I’m not surprised. We’re not in the same world. One of your feet is in the system, and gossip will revolve around you if you lead a luxurious life. Why don’t you listen to me and leave to work with me? With your medical skills and the strength of the Medicine Deity Corporation, we can become the biggest TCM corporation in a few years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Guofeng shook his head at Bai Fan’s suggestion. His Wang Family was a family of imperial physicians, and both his grandfather and father were paying a great deal of attention to him. Although he might be able to earn lots of money by leaving his current post, he was still yearning for the glory of a physician. He was only playing around by having one of his feet in the business world. In the future, he would walk on the same path as his grandfather and father by becoming a national physician and serve authoritative figures. In ancient times, that would be equivalent to an imperial physician, and it represented the highest glory for a doctor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Wang Guofeng was stubborn down to his bones, Bai Fan did not continue to persuade him. After all, he was only making use of Wang Guofeng’s reputation and connections for the swift development of the Medicine Deity Corporation. In the outside world, Wang Guofeng was the representative of the Medicine Deity Corporation, and only the medical skills of the Wang Family can receive the title of Medicine Deity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan brought Wang Guofeng to He City’s Business Clubhouse. Although the exterior looked ordinary and similar to a starred hotel, the interior was dominating with luxury. There was also a fragrance lingering in the air with ladies in revealing clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they came to a private room, they saw a blonde woman who had been waiting for them. She had exquisite features and rosy lips with her blonde hair bundled up. Every single action of hers was enchanting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Miss Rangure, how are you?” Wang Guofeng took the initiative and gave a greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing up from her seat, Rangure nodded her head towards Wang Guofeng. The room was warm, and her coat was on the hanger. She wore a low cleavage beige shirt, and because of her voluptuous figure, half of her chest was exposed. She walked towards Wang Guofeng and gave him a hug, which left him surprised and his heart nearly jumped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Wang Guofeng admired Rangure, he knew that she was a thorny rose. Thus, he was a little surprised that she would be so passive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Rangure finished hugging him, she tapped Wang Guofeng’s lips with her finger and gave a charming smile. “You’re not allowed to behave like a stranger with me the next time we meet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roger that. Rangure is a good friend of mine, and friends can be more casual without the need of etiquette.” smiled Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan could see that Rangure was trying to seduce Wang Guofeng, which made him inwardly snickered. He was a smart person, and knew that Rangure was a viper. He was more than willing to see Wang Guofeng fall, so he was more than happy to see Rangure flirting around with Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s eat while we talk!” Bai Fan waved the bell beside him and waiters came in with the menu.</span></p>

We want to thank Miss Rangure for your help. The Medicine Deity Corporation’s skincare products have passed the audit, and we will officially launch into the Europe market tomorrow.
