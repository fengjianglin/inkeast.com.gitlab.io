 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo did not sleep well last night, she had eyebags around her eyes. She drove a locally produced Haval H1, and it was hard to imagine that someone from the Shui Family would get such a cost-effective vehicle. Then again, no one would dare to provoke the car if they noticed the car license plate that started with 京V. After all, anyone who can obtain this plate license wasn’t a pushover, and it was practically a symbol of status.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the car license plate was too unusual for the vehicle, which attracted the attention of many drivers. Hence, anyone who sees this car would know that the driver was the princess of the Shui Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Shui Junzhuo had a driver's license, her skill was nothing extraordinary. She turned the navigation to high volume. But even with the navigation, she would react a tad slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao found it funny. He never expected that the intelligent Shui Junzhuo would be someone who didn’t recognise her way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how Su Tao held his laughter, Shui Junzuo immediately blushed as she explained, “I’ve shown my embarrassing side. I’ve been incapable of recognising the road ever since I was young, and I’m still unfamiliar with many places despite staying in Beijing for so long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao replied, “It was hard on you. Why don’t you make a stop to the side and let me take over?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo briefly hesitated, but she shook her head in the end. “There’s nothing I can do even if you despise me. As the saying goes, husband and car cannot be loaned. This is my bottom line as a person!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao never expected that Shui Junzhuo would know this saying and replied, “What if the car is loaned to your husband?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo was briefly stunned before she rolled her eyes at Su Tao. “Then, it’s naturally fine, but it’s a pity that we’re not related!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, let me rephrase my words. What if the car is loaned to your boyfriend?” Su Tao continued his teasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo felt her body burning as she inwardly cursed Su Tao for his teasing. Hence, she purposely jammed on the breaks, which Su Tao was startled and flew forward. If it wasn’t for the seatbelt holding him in his seat, he would probably be kissing the windshield by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oops, I’m sorry! I’m not good at driving, so please don’t trigger me. Please forgive this female driver here!” Shui Junzhuo innocently said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao’s forehead was covered with wrinkles as he inwardly swore that he would never tease Shui Junzhuo ever again whenever she’s driving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vehicle drove into Dongzhimen, where trees decorated the two sides of the road. At the same time, Shui Junzuo excitedly introduced, “When the fall season arrives, this road will be turned into a Ginko avenue with gold everywhere, and it’s gorgeous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the majestic building that hung flags of different countries, Su Tao knew that this must be an embassy and smiled. “Now that we’re reaching our destination, can you tell me which foreign VIP I’ll be treating?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo was briefly stunned before she smiled. “I knew I couldn’t hide it from you! It was my father who asked me to invite you over. No, to be exact, it’s a Russian friend of my father. He has a relative who visited the hospital numerous times and tried numerous medicine but there are still no signs of any recovery. Now that he’s in China, he sought my father to find an outstanding doctor to treat that relative of his, since he wasn’t familiar around here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Russian?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Su Tao couldn’t help thinking of Vera as he inquired, “What’s the condition of the patient?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s a famous rhythmic gymnastics athlete, known as the Queen of Rhythmic Gymnastics and the pride of Russia. But she started to eat excessively two months ago during her training and gained 20 kilograms.” Shui Junzhuo helplessly replied as she continued, “She has done a health checkup, but there’s nothing wrong with her body. Even psychologists couldn’t find anything wrong with her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll give it a try, then.” Su Tao sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Russian embassy was massive. It was similar to a medium-sized university. There were also many buildings located at the rear, where the Russians bought properties here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo’s vehicle smoothly passed through a few gantries before arriving at the lawn of a villa with a voluptuous Russian woman walking over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hello, Irina!” Shui Junzhuo hugged the woman as a form of greeting after she got out from the vehicle, which Su Tao could tell that they share a pretty good relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Welcome, Junzhuo!” Irina turned to look at Su Tao in perplexion as she asked, “This is…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s the physician that I’ve invited over to treat Natasha!” Shui Junzhuo introduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao noticed the flash of doubt across Irina’s eyes; he knew that she was like everyone else who doubted his ability due to his young age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Irina had concealed it perfectly, perhaps due to Shui Junzhuo’s presence, and she smiled. “Natasha has gotten much better these past few days. Although she’s not willing to practice, her eating condition and weight are now under control.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Irina leading the way, they entered the villa, which Su Tao realised that Shui Junzhuo had held back with her information. It turned out that Natasha was the beloved daughter of a Russian businessman, Ivanov.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The villa was designed in a luxurious style with thick carpets lying on the ground, medieval-style paintings and ornaments hanging on the wall. Aside from that, there were two knight armor suits placed at the two sides of the stairs, an exquisite chandelier hung on the ceiling, and a European-style fireplace that created an exotic atmosphere in the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao walked to the cabinet-of-honors, it was filled with Ivanov’s merits and Natasha’s trophies, medals, and certificates. There were even photos of young Natasha included.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Natasha was a typical Russian beauty. Although she lacked the eastern traits like Vera, she had a strong aura of western beauty that was akin to the aroma of green olives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a particular one that stood out with artistic sense. Natasha held a six-meter ribbon in her hand as it looped around her four times while she was in midair, looking at the far end of the ribbon with a charming smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is it? Isn’t she pretty? If you manage to treat her, she might even pledge herself to you, so you must grasp this opportunity well!” Shui Junzhuo playfully winked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But before Su Tao could reply to Shui Junzhuo, he suddenly heard footsteps coming from the stairs, which instantly left him dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had underestimated the influence of 20 kilograms. The angel from the photo had utterly changed. Not only did she have flabby cheeks, but her perfect figure also seemed clumsy and swollen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, his mood dropped down the valley. It wasn’t because he was disgusted by Natasha’s appearance, but he was affected by her photo and couldn’t believe that he was seeing the same person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a middle-aged man standing beside Natasha and he conversed with Irina in Russian, “Irina, Natasha just has to maintain her current diet, and she will gradually return to her initial weight. As for her unwillingness to continue practicing Rhythmic Gymnastics, I feel that we should respect her decision. Perhaps she’s tired of her past lifestyle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Disappointment flickered in Irina’s eyes as she replied, “Thank you, Mr. Kelov, for making the trip over. We’ve sought famous doctors all over China, but there’s no one near your standard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kelov smiled. “China might be doing well in recent years, but they still pale in comparison to our top medical standards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Russia’s medical studies were renowned throughout the world like the Pavlov First State Medical University of St. Petersburg and <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University</span>, which had a long history and glorious achievements. Those universities were incredibly professional with the latest medical equipment and education that produced many medical experts. Even one-fifth of the boarding students have chosen medical studies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kelov was a professor from the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University</span>, a medical university that was only ranked beneath the Paris Descartes University. Hence, he was naturally qualified to comment on China’s medical standards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Shui Junzhuo was proficient in Russian, she immediately frowned with displeasure upon eavesdropping on their conversation. At the same time, she felt fortunate that Su Tao couldn’t understand Russian; otherwise, he would surely turn around and leave again with his character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Irina realised that she had been rude by talking only to Kelov, so she introduced, “This is our Russia’s divine doctor, Mr. Kelov, and it was due to his examination and prescription that Natasha no longer has a strong urge to eat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Natasha’s face, Su Tao shook his head, which was noticed by Kelov and he found it rude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are these two?” Kelov asked Irina. He didn’t like others showing opinion about his patients.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Irina immediately explained, “This lady is the daughter of my husband’s friend, and this young man is the doctor from China whom she has invited.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao, Kelov instantly, impolitely commented, “Such a young doctor? China’s medical standard is truly terrible. In Russia, anyone who hasn’t undergone strict training cannot provide any medical treatment!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite Shui Junzhuo’s mild temperament, she still couldn’t help being enraged by Kelov’s arrogant attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she refuted with accurate Russian pronunciation, “May I ask how Mr. Kelov determined that Physician Su Tao has not undergone any strict training? Did Russia’s medical university only teach its students on how to judge a book by its cover? In my view, Mr. Kelov lacks in manners, and in China, doctors like you are those without medical ethics. So even if your medical skills are superb, no one would dare to look for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kelov did not expect that Shui Junzhuo was proficient in Russia, which his expression instantly became awkward before turning to indignance. In the end, his expression was replaced by rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Irina also did not expect that the atmosphere would be filled with gunpowder, but she immediately tried to alleviate the situation. “You are all my guests, so please give me some face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a deep breath, Kelov was older, and he couldn’t be bothered to engage in a verbal conflict with the two that were much younger than him, so he snorted, “Since you guys are doctors, then let’s make a bet. If you guys fail to detect Natasha’s illness, then you guys will have to apologise to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His condition wasn’t harsh, since they only had to detect Natasha’s illness to win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll agree with your bet. But if we’re able to detect Natasha’s illness, then not only do you have to apologise to Su Tao, you also have to recognise him as your teacher!” Shui Junzuo had no idea what was wrong with her today. She was acting entirely out of her character. But perhaps it was due to her absolute confidence in Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her confidence was built on numerous miracles as a foundation; hence it was sturdy and unbreakable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Deal! But don’t regret your decision, young lady!” Kelov sneered in disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the three of them conversing in Russian, Su Tao felt his head aching. But even at this moment, he did not know that Shui Junzhuo has made a bet with Kelov on his behalf.</span></p>
