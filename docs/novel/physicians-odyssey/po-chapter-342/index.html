 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flight attendants have always been the dream of men. But in modern society, it wasn’t a good career.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, they did not enjoy a high salary. Their salaries were usually around ¥5,000. As for those in the internship, they could only receive ¥900 a month without any employment benefits. Even if they get promoted to a Senior Stewardess after two years, they would only receive a monthly salary of about ¥8,000, and even if they get promoted to a Leading Stewardess or In-Flight Supervisor, their pay would only be roughly around ¥12,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, this was a career that heavily relied on one’s appearance with a high threshold and competitiveness. If they went over a certain age, they would be replaced by younger stewardesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When that air stewardess returned to the tail of the cabin, she noticed words written behind the note. After taking a look at it, it was actually a prescription to nourish the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was giving her a way out of the embarrassing situation by implying that she must be seeking his help by leaving her number with him. Hence, he gave her a free medical prescription.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many occupational illnesses for air stewardesses like tendinitis, cervical spondylosis, and other strains. For some stewardesses, there would even be red lines on their legs due to varicose veins, their innate constitution and long hours of standing. Hence, there was a trend amongst them to wear medical-grade stockings. But those stockings were thick and tight. It was still alright during the winter, but it was stuffy in summer, not to mention that it wasn’t hygienic for them to wear them for an extended period, since it would be easy for them to contract women-only illnesses. Not to mention that the moment the plane takes off, the air stewardess would bear a high burden on their bodies, so they wouldn’t even have the time to visit the washroom. It would be easy for them to catch urinal diseases.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a single glance, Su Tao could see through any problem in the body of that air stewardess and gave her a standard prescription as her reward for her eyesight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the plane arrived at Qiongjin City’s airport, Su Tao saw Xia Yu waving his hand the moment he came out. Today, Xia Yu wore black with a windbreaker, sunglasses, casual trousers, and black glossy boots. He was extremely eye-catching. He looked like an underworld Godfather from the previous century.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking the luggage from Su Tao, Xia Yu smiled. “I welcome the return of our divine physician!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh, ever since you started dating Yuqin, not only has your taste in fashion improved, it seems that the standard of your speech has also increased.” Su Tao teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pulling his collar, Xia Yu immediately smiled. “Well, men are different with or without a woman around them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, that’s true. Men are usually more casual when they’re living alone, and they can afford to take some risk. But the moment they have a woman, they would have a sense of belonging in their heart and choose a more comfortable life.” Su Tao smiled as he analysed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moving over towards Su Tao’s ears, Xia Yu whispered a few words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Su Tao was briefly stunned before he showed a wry smile. “Aren’t you going a little too fast? You’ve already boarded the train before buying the ticket.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Xia Yu replied, “I didn’t have a choice. Yuqin has a pretty good family condition, and I’m afraid that her family might not agree with our relationship if I don’t get it done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have to give props to your wits.” Su Tao raised his thumbs at Xia Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Showing an embarrassed smile, Xia Yu replied, “Well, I’m actually being forced. It was Yuqin’s idea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao smiled happily. “Women do hold the decision to bear children. If she doesn’t want a child, she can leave you with great disappointment, even if you’ve done tricks to knock her up. I’ll give you a prescription later for a fixed period of time, and I guarantee that the two of you will have a healthy baby.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu let out a sigh. Di Yuqin was a carrier of Hepatitis B. So despite the fact that she was no different from an ordinary person under Su Tao’s treatment, there were still chances of it passing on to the child, and it’s unavoidable for them to be concerned, regardless of the development of modern science.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So how could Su Tao not see through the intention behind Xia Yu’s words?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu and Di Yuqin both had absolute trust in Su Tao’s medical skills, and they believed that Su Tao could help them in this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After picking up Su Tao from the airport, Xia Yu drove all the way to Huaibei Province’s He City. The branch was initially set to open at the beginning of the year, but it was delayed due to various reasons. Hence, Su Tao had to make a trip over to follow up personally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they reached He City and saw Cai Yan, Su Tao had a misperception that she had grown prettier, since it had been some time since they last met. She wore an oversized coat with her brown hair draped over her shoulders and wore fifteen-centimeter heels, looking extremely elegant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good that you’re here, help me take a look at the herbs!” When Cai Yan saw Su Tao, she immediately dumped some work onto him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There shouldn’t be any problem with Zhao Jian’s standard.” Despite Su Tao’s words, he still went to the medicine cabinet and examined the herbs. There couldn’t be any mistakes to this for a pharmacy, and he could tell that Cai Yan has gained a good understanding of a TCM pharmacy since she was concerned about this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Having you to go through it is more assuring.” Cai Yan smiled as she turned around and started issuing orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao made a check, there weren’t any significant issues to the herbs in the cabinet. However, he still readjusted the arrangements a little and placed commonly used herbs at a more convenient location, while placing uncommon herbs at slightly more remote areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Real skills could be seen through the fine details of telling the difference between an experienced and inexperienced physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite Xia Yu’s fashionable clothing, he immediately removed his coat upon entering the branch and started rolling up his sleeves to help. Although Su Tao and Xia Yu’s participation might not increase the speed, the atmosphere was much better, since the boss of the Three Flavour Hall came over from Hanzhou City to help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it was afternoon, Cai Yan and Su Tao finally got themselves free and took a break with a cup of instant coffee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You had it tough. You’ve been the one managing this branch since the renovation.” Su Tao’s gaze fell on Cai Yan’s fingers. Her fingers were no longer that tender, they became much rougher. However, not only did he not find it a flaw, he felt a warmth in his heart instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t help it; I have to return my debt!” Cai Yan teased. “You’ve helped me several times, and I naturally have to do my best to repay you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Actually, there’s no need for such complicated methods!” A smile rose on the corner of Su Tao’s lips as he teased, “You can just marry me to repay your debt.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dream on!” Cai Yan balled her fists as Su Tao purposely pushed his face over and suffered a blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan initially thought that Su Tao would dodge. She never expected that she would hit him so easily. As she rolled her eyes, she spat, “You’re shameless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Women do not love guys that aren’t bad.” Su Tao provoked as he twitched his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re a famous doctor, and if your fans knew that your personal life is such a mess, wouldn’t they be disappointed?” Cai Yan continued to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those fans are incomparable to a finger of yours in my eyes.” Su Tao chuckled. “You wouldn’t have joined my fans club, too, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having her little secret revealed, Cai Yan gently snorted and denied, “I didn’t!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao weakly responded, “A man fears to gain fame, and pig fears to be fat. If I’m given another choice, I would rather be a nobody.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How fake!” Cai Yan would never believe Su Tao’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Cai understands me well!” Su Tao continued his impromptu. Whether he was mocking himself or acting like a fool, he only hoped that Cai Yan could smile to pull their relationship closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could sense her feelings for him, and she had already considered his own career as hers and gave it her all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t talk about that useless stuff!” Cai Yan’s brows loosened up and sighed, “There’s a problem that has to be resolved. Otherwise, our branch won’t be able to open for business.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she used the word ‘our,’ it made Su Tao feel a surge of warmth rise within his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao soon straighten his face and asked, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We couldn’t get the fire safety approval for the branch. I’ve already made a few trips over and even got Aunt Wei to help me clear the path. But it has always been stuck at the fire safety. They kept finding various reasons to delay it. Even the Medicine King Hall’s branch finished their renovation, but our fire safety approval still hasn’t been issued.” The reason why Cai Yan never told Su Tao about it in the past was fearing that he might be worried about it. Furthermore, Su Tao has been traveling, and there was nothing he could do, even if she told him about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any public operation had to be approved for its fire safety regulation, and it was generally stricter for KTV, hotels, nightclubs, and other entertainment outlets. But for pharmacies, it shouldn’t be that strict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like someone is trying to sabotage us.” Su Tao sighed as he continued, “Let me handle this. I’ll get the fire safety approval issued as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Cai Yan saw Su Tao, she felt a strong sense of security. Even though Su Tao was an outsider, and he wasn’t familiar with He City, she believed in his ability to get things done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao had two choices laid before him. First, he could rely on his connections to get establish access with He City’s Fire Safety System. Even if Yan Jing couldn’t help, Sire Shui definitely could. But even if he cleared up the higher connection, he might get impeded by the goons, and in the future, the lower levels of the Fire Safety System might periodically come and create trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second, he could find the problem and slam the background and strength of the Three Flavour Hall in the face of the Fire Safety System. He might be an outsider here, but he’s not a pushover. It was akin to a bell for those that were thinking of obstructing the Three Flavour Hall’s operation, and it would also give a warning to the other departments to not take the Three Flavour Hall lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Prepare the documents that are needed for the application. I’ll handle it myself!” A smile rose on Su Tao’s lips that made Cai Yan feel at ease.</span></p>

 <p>So when a pig becomes fat, that pig would be 'processed' to be eaten, sold etc... Just like how they fed chickens before 'processing' them.</p>
