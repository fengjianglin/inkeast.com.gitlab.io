 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 114 - Yan Wujin’s Martial Arts Dream</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the proverb says, there’s a master in every skill. Training constantly in any skill to perfection could destroy the heavens and ruin the earth. This move of Knife Demon’s had been simplified to just a simple chop. Drawing a big arc with his arm, along with a step forth, although the knife appeared slow and clumsy, it had a stunning bearing, as if it could split the heavens and earth apart. Enveloped by this aura, Su Tao instantly felt that he couldn’t escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the domain that Knife Demon had formed. In ancient times, a Martial Arts Expert had achieved the realm of killing one in ten steps. That meant that their domain covered the ten steps. At this moment, Knife Demon had cultivated that mysterious domain, causing Su Tao to feel like livestock for slaughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Knife Demon’s blade came down, he realised that Su Tao had disappeared. He was instantly astonished, since this was something that was practically in the bag and wouldn’t fail!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sat on the side, covered in sweat as he had just brushed shoulders with a grim reaper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, Su Tao had used the Pulse Art to shorten himself by half an inch, before escaping from the Knife Demon’s knife in a weird position, making a roll and stopped with his back on the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were records in the Imperial Physician Sculpture that the highest state of the Pulse Art could allow one to change their appearance and physique, that meant to change their body shape through the connection between the Seven Apertures of the body and the Meridians to change the body shape and even appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had always thought it to be rubbish, but under that earlier danger, it had allowed him to come in contact with that realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Casting a glance at Su Tao, Knife Demon coldly snorted and let out a weird yell before fleeing. Roughly ten-odd seconds later, Yan Wujin had arrived with his hands behind his back at the spot where Knife Demon previously stood. Casting a glance at Su Tao, he asked, “Are you injured?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just superficial injuries.” Su Tao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin sighed and took several steps forth while muttering, “Are you bullying me, who I couldn’t outrun you at my age?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Yan Wujin appeared, Su Tao knew that he had been saved. Recalling the terrifying killing intent emanating from Knife Demon, he felt fearful. His skills were sufficient for him to deal with ordinary folks, but he would be helpless against a Martial Arts Expert like Knife Demon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Su Tao had focused all his attention on his medical skills, and the energy of a person was limited. If he spent all his energy on Martial Arts, Knife Demon surely wouldn’t be a match for him by now. It’s mainly because one cannot be a jack-of-all-trades, or they would be master of none.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After opening the door and sitting in the hall for half an hour, Yan Wujin returned. There was a huge slit on his azure clothes, the evidence of the danger that he had faced previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Su Tao brewing tea, Yan Wujin took the teacup and said, “Tea made from the Old Street’s well is truly as rumored! Naturally, it is also because of the good tea leaves. This must be freshly picked from the Kongling Mount’s Tea Tree King this year! They only produce a few hundred catty every year.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin was truly formidable, despite not showing anything, he actually possessed bountiful knowledge in his heart. Su Tao nodded his head. “That’s some keen eyesight, Senior Yan. How’s the matter with Knife Demon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin shook his head, “Reaching our level, unless we are willing to fight in a decisive battle, none of us can stop the other party from escaping. It was also uneasy whether I could survive twice under his knife.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao bitterly smiled. “I can only say that I’m unlucky. Earlier, I nearly paid a visit to King Yama. It took a freak combination of factors that I could escape from his knife.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin waved his hand and smiled, “Please don’t say that. If Knife Demon heard that you avoided his assassination by luck, he would probably have his nose crooked from anger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Refilling another cup of tea for Yan Wujin, Su Tao briefly pondered before reminding, “Senior Yan, there’s something that I should say about last time. Now that I’ve seen you again, I have to pour out what’s on my mind, no matter what.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a broad smile, Yan Wujin waved his hand. “Go ahead!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Su Tao briefly arranged his words before saying, “Actually, you’re not suitable to fight anymore!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin was briefly stunned, before he shook his head with a bitter smile. “A man can't help but go with the tides. Stepping a foot into this circle, don’t think of getting out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that as an expert at the level of Yan Wujin, they’re actually extremely familiar with their own physiques. They should know their own condition, so he could only try his best to persuade. “You cultivated the Eight Extremist Fists when you were younger. This set of fist techniques is too overbearing, and it belongs to the sort of Martial Arts that harm your enemy and yourself at the same time. Although you have switched to Taiji when you’re about forty, trying to alleviate the repercussions brought by the Eight Extremist Fists, overusing Taiji will also harm the vitality in your body, despite having the effect of strengthening your body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing Su Tao’s medical skills, Yan Wujin gently replied, “How can we let it go so easily? Let’s go one step at a time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin had saved his life numerous times, and as a doctor, he couldn’t stand and do nothing. Abruptly standing up, he walked towards the medicine cabinet and pulled the drawer, then casually grabbed some herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin watched from the side, grabbing medicine was a foundation in TCM. Attaining the highest level, they could practically weigh it with their hands, and clearly, Su Tao had reached this level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take a minute, and Su Tao had already returned with a packaged medicine. He smiled, “Vitality Nurturing Powder. Brew it and take it once in the morning and night, it will aide your old illnesses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin did not refuse. He finished the tea before leaving with the package.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sending Yan Wujin to the door, Su Tao briefly glanced at the former’s silhouette and sighed in his heart. He could feel a sense of loneliness coming from Yan Wujin, since ordinary people wouldn’t be able to reach their level. For someone that was so obsessed with Martial Arts, calling them to give up was a mistake, and Su Tao was starting to regret his words.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin strolled, and he could feel the sincerity from Su Tao’s reminder. All along, Yan Wujin had been a Martial Arts Grandmaster in fists, and most people only looked at his appearance and not in his heart. Thus, he had been suffering quietly, but he had to grit his teeth and persevere. Once they’ve stepped in it, giving up was absolutely impossible unless they gave up entirely on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he knew it, Yan Wujin had already returned to his home, and just when he wanted to push the doors open, Yan Sha opened them from the inside and she looked at Yan Wujin. “Grandfather, you fought again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin sighed, “Isn’t it all because of the Yuezhou’s Knife Demon returning? Adding on to his injuries this time, I don’t think he has the guts to return any more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Sha knitted her brows before she entered the house and came back out with a treasured sword and knitted her eyebrows. “Why don’t I go and give him another sword?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You? You’re still lacking.” Yan Wujin shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Sha unhappily pulled the sword out. The blade and the sheath rubbed each other, emanating a ringing noise before she said in a clear voice, “Grandfather, didn’t you say that I am talented? It’s just a Knife Demon, and I’m confident that I can deal with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a gentle smile, Yan Wujin explained, “In terms of strength right now, you might not be weaker than him when he has suffered injuries. But Knife Demon must have experienced all sorts of trials between life and death to be able to make it so far. The more predicaments you are in, the more dangerous it will be, and you have always been lacking in that matter of training, so I cannot allow you to risk your life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sighing out, Yan Sha revealed reluctance in her eyes. “Grandfather, you must bring me along, alright? I will definitely be able to help you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gently rubbing Yan Sha’s hair, Yan Wujin smiled. “Where’s your mother? She’s working OT again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a flash of disappointment when Yan Wujin mentioned her mother before Yan Sha replied, “She has led the team to hunt down a drug syndicate in another province. I have no idea when she will return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin sighed, “She’s working too hard and forgot about her family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although hunting down a drug syndicate might sound dangerous, Yan Wujin knew the ability of this Daughter-in-Law of his, and there’s no issue in her protecting herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Yan Sha responded, “Grandfather, I don’t see it that way. Mother is a heroine, so I must also become a criminal police like her when I grow up to clean out the poison in society.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Wujin’s gaze gently flashed. His Daughter-in-Law had been too great of an influence to Yan Sha. Ever since his son had passed away, his Daughter-in-Law has been infatuated with her work. Yan Wujin faintly said, “Rest early. You still have school tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Sha nodded her head with her braids swinging while she went up. When Yan Wujin looked at Yan Sha’s silhouette, he felt a complicated emotion in his heart.</span></p>
