 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo immediately gave Ivanov a call and explained the entire situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Ivanov already got to know from his wife that their daughter finally had hope of recovery. Although Kelov was beaten up, he was the one who provoked the other party first. Hence, not only did Ivanov not pursue the matter, he even expressed his sincerest apology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Ivanov also did not want his family’s matters to blow up. As a businessman, he knew the meaning of resolving troubles into nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Kelov, Ivanov had no favourable opinion of the former, to begin with. The former relied on his decent medical skills to act arrogantly and boast his own ability in their conversation, emphasising on his relationship with the president, which made Ivanov feel disgusted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hanging up the call with Shui Junzhuo, Ivanov gave the Vice-Principal of the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Sergei, a call.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sergei was responsible for the foreign affairs of the university, and he’s accountable for dispatching all the specialists abroad. As for Ivanov, Sergei was familiar with this person. Although Ivanov was overseas most of the time, he’s mighty within Russia’s upper circle and was rumoured to be the greatest competitor for the top tycoon in Russia. Thus, Sergei had to handle this matter carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sergei, I’m thoroughly disappointed in Kelov. Not only has he failed to treat my daughter’s condition, he even went around, causing trouble in China for me! Right now, please inform him to return to Russia immediately!” Ivanov’s stern voice resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that voice, Sergei was startled, before he immediately inquired, “Kelov is one of the best specialists in our university. Although his temper is a little fiery, it shouldn’t be a problem as long as he makes a move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a deep sigh, Ivanov replied, “You guys don’t have to worry about my daughter anymore. I only have one request, ask Kelov to return immediately, since I do not wish for him to cause any trouble here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll inform him immediately!” Sergei wryly smiled as he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon hanging up the call, Sergei locked his brows and pondered for a long time before he finally gave Kelov a call.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Kelov had just arrived at his hotel, and he was currently treating his injuries before a mirror. The injuries were painful, to begin with, and when the sterilising alcohol touched them, it would hurt even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gritting his teeth, he swore that he had to take revenge for this matter. At the same time, he had already planned to give a call to all the high-ranking officials he knew, since he had once treated them. If they knew how he was bullied in China, they would undoubtedly be willing to sound out their voices for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he received a call from Sergei, which was really a coincidence, since he was about to report his humiliation and seek for help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Vice-President Sergei, I was just about to inform you that I was beaten up in China!” Kelov’s anger flared up as he continued, “I’m here representing the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, so you have to fight for my rights!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Sergei remained silent. He never expected that Kelov still had no idea how serious this matter was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Kelov continued to threaten, “Why aren’t you saying anything? If the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University doesn’t want to help me, then I can only choose to leave. I don’t feel comfortable staying in a place that doesn’t feel safe and doesn’t have any sense of belonging!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Sergei was thoroughly angered by Kelov’s arrogant words. Kelov was fortunate that his stinking mouth did not get him killed overseas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Sergei slowly said, “Firstly, I’m calling with regards to this matter. Just a moment ago, the honourable Mr. Ivanov had just called me and explained the matter. The reason why you were beaten up was related to yourself, and I have to remain impartial in this matter; secondly, you are to return to our country immediately. This is a request coming from Mr. Ivanov himself; and last but not least, if you really wish to leave the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, I believe no one will obstruct you because it’s your freedom and you did not sign any slavery contract with the university. Furthermore, the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University is an individual organisation, so it will still function normally even if it loses a person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Kelov felt his entire world spinning. Since when has he suffered such humiliation? But some people were like that, preying on the weak and fearing the strong. Hence, he bowed his head after receiving such a reprimand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll immediately return!” Kelov’s head sank low as he helplessly replied, “I had enough of this place as well!”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng was currently bringing Ling Yu around in a mysterious building to meet with a few familiar people. Although Wang Guofeng has stopped treating patients, as according to his grandfather, Wang Xi’s request, he had been trying his best to nurture his Junior Brother, hoping that the latter could grow up faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, he was so passionate and hoped that Ling Yu could threaten Su Tao and take revenge for the past grudges. Furthermore, he was using the same tactic as Bai Fan to nurture Ling Yu into his tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he didn’t treat patients anymore, he could still get his way across with Ling Yu by using his resources in the medical industry to strengthen the Medicine Deity Corporation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he had already guessed why the mysterious lady, Rangure, chose him after they’ve worked together for some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had lost his capital, then he naturally had to find a replacement. Only in this manner, would he still have worth to Rangure, and he wouldn’t be abandoned like Bai Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Wang Guofeng thought of grooming Ling Yu into his successor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the Range Rover, Wang Guofeng looked at Ling Yu and sighed. Despite the latter’s young age, he actually managed to be neither servile nor overbearing and remained so calm before so many leaders that were similar to his master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll take you to a place to relax since we’re done with our matters.” Wang Guofeng turned the steering wheel as he drove and asked, “It has been some time since I met with a buddy of mine, why don’t I bring you over and get you to know him as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not familiar with Beijing, and you’re my guide. So I’ll just follow you.” Ling Yu politely smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng pridefully said, “Although I’m usually in Qiongjin, I’ve grown up here, and I have friends around here. They’re all doing pretty well these days too, and they’re all wealthy and respectable people. Later, when I bring you over, you must show some of your abilities. If you can impress them, then you won’t have to wander around if you’re trying to gain a footing in Beijing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words were a little partial, which Ling Yu felt uncomfortable upon hearing them. But when he recalled his master’s recent words to him, a smile rose on his lips and he did not put this matter in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he went out as a wandering doctor, the Medical Dao Sect’s Sect Master told him, “Come into being from the wild mountains and enter the world through the city. First, come into being before entering the world for you to understand the Medical Dao’s essence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Ling Yu treated everyone as a form of cultivation. As for his Senior Brother’s words, he has treated it as cultivation for his mentality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, the Range Rover parked at a high-rise building and Wang Guofeng and Ling Yu took the lift to the nineteenth floor. When they came to the reception, Wang Guofeng took out his VIP card and the attractive attendant led them through the long hallway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along the way, they would occasionally pass by revealing ladies and Wang Guofeng smiled before turning to Ling Yu. “Have you taken a liking to any of them? I can call them over for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ling Yu pursed his lips and kept his silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng felt that his Junior Brother was way too introverted and still had no idea of a woman’s beauty. When this brat grows up in the future, he will probably thank him for taking such good care of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a commercial leisure clubhouse and Beijing was extremely strict with their entertainment places nowadays. Hence, these clubhouses that were higher class generally had a strict admittance. After they passed through a few corners, they arrived at the private room that sat seven to eight people with both genders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The women were either singing or accompanying others to drink while the men were busy groping the woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey! Young Master Feng is finally here!” The man who sat in the middle stood up and walked towards Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Patting his shoulder, Wang Guofeng introduced, “This is my Junior Brother, Ling Yu! This is my buddy, Huo Kun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was indeed a coincidence that Wang Guofeng was meeting Ni Jingqiu’s boyfriend, Huo Kun, who Su Tao had saved back in the park.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After getting Wang Guofeng and Ling Yu to sit down, a woman came over, which Huo Kun gently pushed her away and smiled. “Don’t be so flirty, can’t you see that I want to chat now? I’ll deal with you later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master Kun, you’re still so unconventional? You’re going to get married, so wouldn’t it be bad if your fiancée knew about this?” Wang Guofeng smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Kun unhappily waved his hand. “It has been a long time since we met, can you not speak of these mood-killing things?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Wang Guofeng replied, “You have to take it a little easy. The Ni Family is powerful in Beijing, and it’s beneficial for both you and the Huo Family to become the Ni Family’s son-in-law.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gently hammering Wang Guofeng in the chest, Huo Kun sourly said, “Bloody hell, only you dare to rub salt on my wounds. I’m also someone with strong self-esteem, and if it wasn’t for the family’s benefits, why would I make such a huge sacrifice? But you don’t have to worry about it, this is just having some fun, and Jingqiu wouldn’t ask much even if she knew about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Raising his thumbs, Wang Guofeng smiled. “I take my hat off to you! You’re the real expert here, and you’re practically the idol of all men.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Kun revealed an unnoticeable wry smile, since only he knew about his difficulty. If anyone encountered someone like Ni Jingqiu, who wouldn’t find an opportunity to have some fun outside?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, we’re done with our greetings, let us enjoy ourselves!” Huo Kun gave an eye-signal to the attractive lady beside him, which she immediately called two ladies over and sat beside Wang Guofeng and Ling Yu. After pouring a cup of wine, they took a grape each and placed it by the two person’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll do it myself.” Ling Yu smiled as he took the toothpick from the girl and gently placed it in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Guofeng saw this, he did not pay much attention to it, since his Junior Brother must have visited this sort of place for the first time, and it’s natural that he couldn’t open his mind. Hence, Wang Guofeng let Ling Yu get used to the atmosphere by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he sighed. He slowly fell in this manner under Bai Fan’s temptation back then.</span></p>
