 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao did not stay in South Korea to enjoy the applause and praises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His performance at the International Medical Summit has won many people over. But because of South Korea’s defeat, the South Korean media found a loophole and reported, “Does the young Physician King, Su Tao, possess the bloodline of the Republic of Korea?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news instantly caused a commotion and many fans of Su Tao attacked South Korea’s media on the internet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck, are you guys really that shameless? So all capable people are Koreans? Why are you guys so shameless?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Admit defeat if you lose. Don’t find an excuse and disgust everyone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao is from China, and I can prove that. I’m his ex-girlfriend…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simply putting it, it was a complete mess on the internet, since many Chinese felt prideful. After all, Su Tao has won honorably, leaving the other party at their wit’s end and they would go as far as finding such a reason to retain their honor.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a brightly lit room, a man donned in black was kneeled in the center, looking helpless. He was feeling nervous from the shame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry that we failed to bring Su Tao back. A group of experts suddenly appeared, and if I’ve guessed correctly, they should be special forces tasked to bring Su Tao back.” That man was the person who went after Su Tao earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get up! I never expected that his background would be so powerful. I received information from my channel that he received the favor of a certain powerful family in China. If we take him down, it might complicate the situation.” A woman was seated in the office desk before the black-clothed man. She had a graceful figure. She slowly turned around and looked at the man. “Stay abroad for the time being and return after this matter dies down. You should be targeted by now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man felt greatly relieved as he kowtowed on the ground. When he left, he noticed that his entire body was covered in sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman let out a sigh and tapped on her lips. She took out her phone and made a call, “We failed to capture him. He has gone back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it, then! Kwon Woo-bin’s father has terminal cancer, and I’m afraid Su Tao might not be confident in treating him. Not to mention that the Kwon Family’s fall is determined.” A voice resounded from the other side. “This time, Su Tao has ruined our plans several times, and the fall of the Kwon Family is fixed. For the time being, we will lay low until we’ve accumulated enough power to rise again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about the sacrifice?” The woman asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I initially wanted to make a gesture. But not only did it fail, the media even exposed it. We have to destroy all the evidence and calm the rumors.” The person from the other side analysed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Disrupting rumors through teams to shift the attention off the president. It was a frequent political tactic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the plan failed, and the Kwon Family was captured. Even if they wanted to cover it up, the judgment of the law was inevitable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about that prosecutor, Han Jung-yul?” The woman asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s just a puny prosecutor. Someone will make things difficult for him and he’ll give up.” The voice replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through this event, South Korea underwent turmoil, and it was inevitable for the Park Family to replace the Kwon Family as the most prominent force in Seoul. As for the female president, she would be investigated by the prosecutor’s office, since their plan has been exposed. Hence, they would surely have to lay low for the time being and remain low-profile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this trip to South Korea, Su Tao has gotten rid of the hidden enemy, Master Qian, and obtained a stable group of fans. At the same time, he defeated Kim Jung-ho. Overall, he helped the Park Family stabilise their status, which indirectly affected the balance between the two countries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Smaller cases, we treat illnesses; medium cases, we treat people; large cases, we treat the country. That was the essence behind Su Tao’s performance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was just a chess piece amongst the masses, and not every single one of his merits was noted by everyone. However, Sire Shui has been paying attention to Su Tao, so his evaluation of him rose again.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After arriving at the Minnan Province once again, Su Tao saw Cao Huaiqing the moment he got off the plane. The latter was looking at Su Tao with a respectful expression. The latter knew that he couldn’t judge Su Tao by his appearance, since he had already received the word from the hospital that his father, Cao Dingjun, was suffering from Senile Dementia. Two weeks ago, Su Tao had only relied on his eyes to achieve this detection. Hence, he had no choice but to see Su Tao in a new light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Dechun was standing not too far away from Cao Huaiqing. As Cao Dingjun’s personal doctor, he was naturally held responsible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Physician Su, thanks for taking the time to make a trip to Minnan Province.” Cao Huaiqing’s attitude has undergone a drastic change at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s human nature. Su Tao was long used to it, so he wasn’t bothered by that. He was only treating Cao Dingjun due to Sire Shui, and if it was someone else, he would naturally not cooperate with them with his temper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had a temper, and Su Tao wasn’t an exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to take a look at the case file.” Su Tao did not bother replying to Cao Huaiqing’s courteous words and went directly into the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his request, Xia Dechun handed over the file over. Su Tao had caused a huge uproar in the International Medical Summit. Although he was in the country, he had also heard rumors from his circle that Su Tao has been determined to be the youngest divine physician in China with the highest potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Dechun had personally witnessed the magic of TCM, but he was still skeptical about treating Senile Dementia. After all, it was a world-class tricky issue. Senile Dementia was greatly related to the human body’s function, and the main reason for it was cerebral atrophy. From the western medicine angle, they could only use medicine to slow down the disease, and it was practically impossible for it to be treated thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flipping through the file, Su Tao gained a rough understanding of Cao Dingjun’s condition, paired together with his previous observation. Although he had determined that the illness would undergo an outbreak within these last few days, it shouldn’t be so severe. Worse comes to worst, Cao Dingjun should only suffer in the decline of his memory and have mobility issues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Cao Dingjun was currently unconscious, so he had to ponder over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did the old man consume rabbit meat recently?” Su Tao closed the file and pulled Xia Dechun to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, he ate wolfberry with rabbit meat yesterday — wolfberry to nourish the liver with the effect of lowering blood pressure. The rabbit meat can strengthen his body. This is a nourishing medicinal cuisine that a famous expert prescribed for the old man.” Xia Dechun was startled by Su Tao’s words. There wouldn’t be an issue with this, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the Compendium of Medical Herbs 1596, the characteristic of rabbit meat can nourish the body and expel toxins, but it’s a taboo to be used in cuisine. As the saying goes, rabbits can kill if their eyes are closed. If they died with their eyes closed, there would be toxins present in their flesh, and it cannot be consumed. But it’s not that profound, just avoid for pregnant women, those lacking Yang in the body, and children with chickenpox. The old man’s physique belongs to the lacking of Yang, so his condition would deteriorate if he consumes rabbit meat.” Su Tao explained with his brows locked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s explanation was detailed. Although Xia Dechun knew nothing about TCM, he knew that those words weren’t bullshit. He initially wanted to use medicinal cuisine to nourish the old man’s body, but he never expected that he would cause the condition to deteriorate instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this matter got out, not only would it affect Xia Dechun’s position, but he might even be reduced to a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pulling him aside and not mentioning it before Cao Huaiqing was protecting his honor. This made Xia Dechun’s perception of Su Tao to change. He realised that this was a young man who knew how to conduct himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But truth be told, he was also in an awkward position. Cao Dingjun was against seeing doctors and refused to accept any treatment. Although he consumed wolfberry with rabbit meat, instantly ruining the balance in his body and causing his Senile Dementia to break out, it had nothing to do with Xia Dechun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone refuses treatment, not even a deity can treat them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The patient’s Yin and Yang were still balanced before, so it’s impossible to detect with medical apparatuses.” Su Tao looked through the file and determined that there was a tendency for Senile Dementia. But he still couldn’t figure out why Cao Dingjun was unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s the case. Is there any treatment for it?” Xia Dechun asked in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is, but I’ll need Doctor Xia to work together with me!” The reason why Su Tao talked to Xie Dechun so nicely was due to a little scheme he had in mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please, speak your mind!” Xia Dechun had considered Su Tao as a doctor at his level by now, and no longer look down on the latter due to his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had also done a foreshadowing to allow Xia Dechun to look at him in a new light. If the latter hadn’t personally witnessed how Su Tao accurately detected Sire Cao’s Senile Dementia, how could he be willing to listen to the words of a young man?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moving towards Xia Dechun’s ears, Su Tao whispered his thoughts. Xia Dechun’s brows briefly locked together with perplexion in his eyes before helplessly sighing, “No problem! As long as Sire Cao can recover, I’m willing to put on an act with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao followed Xia Dechun to Cao Dingjun’s ICU ward, the latter was currently on an oxygen mask as the apparatus beside him pulsed. Although he looked like an ordinary person, he was unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Dechun had a high position in the Western Medicine industry, and he swiftly arranged to get Cao Dingjun into the surgery room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You need help?” He asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nope, my medical box will be sufficient!” Su Tao arranged his medical box and retrieved his needle belt, then performed acupuncture for Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, it’s not tough for him to get Cao Dingjun to regain his consciousness, but trying to treat the Senile Dementia required some unique methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He inserted the needles into the Hegu, Jusanli, and Yuji Acupoints. Those three were effective for the treatment in the lacking of Yang. When Xia Dechun saw the beads of sweat on Su Tao’s nose, he knew that Su Tao wasn’t merely performing acupuncture, but he was fully focused on the needles. That was the highest realm of acupuncture!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the acupuncture session ended, Su Tao started to massage Cao Dingjun’s abdomen. Along with the great force, Cao Dingjun suddenly opened his eyes and vomited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had already predicted this and had prepared a bucket to contain the foul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few minutes later, Cao Dingjun fully regained his consciousness. However, he had vomited violently and was weak at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where am I?” Cao Dingjun started to look around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The hospital!” Xia Dechun came up and replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hospital?” Cao Dingjun instantly became unhappy and declared, “I want to leave now!” He was extremely against hospitals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old man, I’m afraid that you won’t be going anywhere!” Xia Dechun subconsciously looked at Su Tao and sighed. He had to put on a realistic act, “You’re suffering from a terminal disease, and you only have a few days left!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” Cao Dingjun was terrified. He couldn’t help reacting in this manner, but his physique was weak, so he fainted again!</span></p>
