 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cloud Grass had a strict requirement for the environment. It can only grow in a suitable environment. Although human’s creativity could create an environment for plants, it wasn’t easy to create a similar environment for unique plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had the same logic to science. Despite the constant development of science, it’s still impossible for them to interpret the process of the human mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mother nature was mysterious, and it had to be respected. Otherwise, some precious things would disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden Chicken Mountain was a treasure, it’s just that no one could recognise its worth. Not only was there a high possibility of a silver mine being beneath this mountain, but there were also various magical herbs that could benefit humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Going back down the mountain wasn’t that complicated. Xu Dashan found a convenient way. When they returned and saw Shui Junzhuo, Su Tao noticed that her eyes were flickering with concern and excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Shui Junzhuo turned around and did not want to talk to Su Tao. Walking up to her, Su Tao said, “You wouldn’t be that petty, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re a liar!” Shui Junzhuo threw a tantrum. She was definitely acting out of character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s for your best interest!” Su Tao shrugged as he continued, “I’ve already played along with you since you wanted to experience how camping in the mountain feels like.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo snorted, but after a brief pondering, she didn’t find any meaning in it and asked, “Did you find what you’re looking for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We were lucky!” Su Tao pridefully patted on his medical box. “I plucked some, and there’s enough to treat Sire Cao. But I have something I would like to ask for your help!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Shui Junzhuo nodded her head. “Go ahead and say it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pulling Shui Junzhuo to the side, Su Tao whispered, “I need you to get Sire Shui to protect this Golden Chicken Mountain from being destroyed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Shui Junzhuo briefly hesitated before she promised, “Alright, I’ll tell grandpa about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was someone else making this request, they would undoubtedly be treated as making a big fuss out of nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Su Tao was different. In Shui Junzhuo’s heart, Su Tao was a man blessed with wisdom, and he wouldn’t make such a request if there wasn’t anything significant in the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To people in the TCM industry, Cloud Grass is a magical treasure.” Su Tao explained with a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. I believe that grandpa can easily resolve this matter.” Shui Junzhuo replied straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he requested Shui Junzhuo to get Sire Shui’s help to protect Golden Chicken Mountain wasn’t because he feared that someone would go and pluck the Cloud Grass. The Cloud Grass had a complicated procedure to be plucked, and general people wouldn’t know its worth; so there wasn’t any use for them. He was afraid that the silver mine might be exposed and if someone laid an intention on it, the Cloud Grass would be gone. All they had to do was detonate the entire mountain to retrieve the treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s no eternal secret. Even if Su Tao believed that Xu Dashan wouldn’t reveal this secret, people would definitely pay attention to the latter due to him. If someone linked the clues together, it wouldn’t be tough for them to figure out a thing or two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had many enemies, and there wasn’t a lack of people waiting for him to reveal his flaws.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A guest arrived in the TCM Department Head’s office in Qiongjin City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Guofeng saw Bai Fan, he was surprised before he closed the door and locked his brows together. “Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan smiled and casually sat on the couch. Looking around, he did not find any ashtray, so he went to take a cup of water from the dispenser before returning to the couch. After lighting up a cigarette, he asked, “Why? I'm not welcomed? Am I that shameful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Wang Guofeng replied, “Although the leader in the hospital doesn’t care about my affairs outside, I still have to maintain a low profile. There’s a complicated string of relationships in the hospital, and I would’ve been brought down by someone if my reputation wasn’t big enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spreading his hands on the couch, smoke exited Bai Fan’s nose and mouth as he responded, “Wrong. Your reputation is worth nothing. It’s the reputation of your father and grandfather that has granted you an untouchable plaque.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng smiled as he turned on the air-conditioner in the office. The smoke from cigarettes was extremely stinging to the eyes, and he could feel his eyes aching. Thus, he opened a window and sighed, “What is it? You wouldn’t come looking for me if there’s nothing, so there must be an important matter with your trip here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Extinguishing the cigarette in the disposable cup, Bai Fan said with an unsightly expression, “Your trip to South Korea this time was initially hoping for Medicine Deity Corporation to open up a new market, but I never expected that there wouldn’t be any harvest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his words, Wang Guofeng instantly became unhappy. “You’re blaming me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Bai Fan knew that Wang Guofeng was prideful, so he continued, “I’m only reminding you not to lose your courage and confidence. Su Tao is slowly grinding down your willpower!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan managed to see through Wang Guofeng. He went straight to where it hurts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having his soft spot jabbed at, Wang Guofeng’s breathing turned rough. “You have to admit that Su Tao is a rare talent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“China’s culture runs deep, and it never lacks talents.” Bai Fan indifferently replied. “I placed my money on you because you have more of an advantage than Su Tao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks for your encouragement!” Wang Guofeng knew that Bai Fan was using another method to stimulate him. He also knew that his mentality has lost balance, and on this trip to South Korea, even Kim Jung-ho has lost to Su Tao, which created a sense of inferiority in Wang Guofeng’s heart. At this moment, he has already lost the confidence to compete with Su Tao again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re partners, and the Medicine Deity Corporation will grow stronger if you do.” Bai Fan sighed. “Have you started preparing for the national healer candidacy? If you successfully become a national physician, it will be a promotion for the Medicine Deity Corporation, and I believe that we will be able to catch up to the Three Flavour Cosmetics International’s steps.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve already mentioned this to my father, but he did not give me an immediate response. Don’t worry about it. Regardless of anything, I will do my best and obtain the candidacy.” Wang Guofeng declared with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I have already made arrangements. Although the national healer’s judges will be different every year, I can find most of the judges.” Bai Fan revealed a cunning smile as he continued, “As long as you get through the examination, I will guarantee your success!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng’s expression suddenly turned grave as he said, “Bai Fan, I hope that you can trust my strength in this manner and allow me to receive this honour without any tricks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Bai Fan smiled. “Alright, I’ll promise you!” However, he had another thought in his heart. If Wang Guofeng wasn’t capable enough, then he had to create the conditions and opportunities for the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Bai Fan was certain that he had to create a glorified image for Wang Guofeng. In this manner, he would be able to push for a faster development for the Medicine Deity Corporation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, I need your help with another matter!” Bai Fan’s eyes flickered with a cold light as he continued, “The Beautifying Cream from the Three Flavour Cosmetics International is better than the products of our Medicine Deity Corporation without any side effects. I’ve bought their products on the market, but I couldn’t find the crucial ingredients in their products after analysing it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Medicine King Valley is famed for medicinal research. How can I help you, if you can’t find it?” Wang Guofeng questioned in disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know that you have a close relationship with an employee in the Three Flavour Hall! Can you get that person to help us with the prescription?” Bai Fan lowered his voice and continued, “Guofeng, the Medicine Deity Corporation is your business, and you can’t just sweep your hands clean, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want me to steal their secret prescription?” Wang Guofeng instantly grew enraged as he slammed his palm on the table. “Even if I, Wang Guofeng, am useless, I will not do anything that goes against my principle!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Bai Fan explained with a smile, “That isn’t considered stealing, we’re just borrowing their prescription. I believe that with the Medicine King Valley’s strength, we will be able to upgrade it if we obtain the prescription, and we will be able to create a product with a longer lifespan than the Three Flavour Cosmetics International.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me consider it!” Wang Guofeng held his guard up against Bai Fan, but he never expected that the latter would understand him so thoroughly and even investigate Mo Sui’er’s feelings for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their partnership could be considered one with the most distrust in it. The two of them held their guard up against each other and weren’t unwilling to reveal their backs to one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, I hope that you can invite an influential figure for my Medicine King Hall’s new branch. The Three Flavour Hall has advertised that Dou Fanggang would be providing free consultations in the opening of their new branch, and it has caused a massive ripple.” Bai Fan said. “You know that that new branch of the Medicine King Hall is meant to hinder the development of the Three Flavour Hall. According to Su Tao’s intention, the Three Flavour Hall will expand in the blueprint of a chain; so we had to keep up with his steps.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re too concerned about Su Tao!” Wang Guofeng sighed. Right now, Bai Fan’s reputation within the TCM industry was damaged, after harming his master, so he couldn't invite any influential figure to host an event in the new branch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, you’re not concerned about Su Tao?” Bai Fan attacked with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m concerned, but I will defeat him with honour!” Wang Guofeng replied. “But I will try and help you arrange an influential figure. I’ll let you know beforehand that it won’t be a small price!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his hand, Bai Fan smiled. “Don’t worry. I’m never a miser.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With concern flickering in Wang Guofeng’s eyes, he said in a fearful tone, “Whether it’s the Three Flavour Cosmetics International or the Three Flavour Hall, they’re both Su Tao’s public business. I’ve heard that Su Tao recently used the TCM Alliance’s name to establish a Qihuang Charity Funds. Not only are they acquiring orphanages and nursing homes, they even rented an entire mountain in Sichuan Province.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about that!” Bai Fan sneered. “I believe that he must have his eyes set on some business opportunity by using the Qihuang Charity Funds. As for Sichuan Province, I have already sent someone to investigate, and I believe that we will soon find out what Su Tao is doing there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan inwardly commented that Wang Guofeng was being a hypocrite. Although the latter claimed that he wanted to defeat Su Tao with honour, he was also cunning, just like him.</span></p>
