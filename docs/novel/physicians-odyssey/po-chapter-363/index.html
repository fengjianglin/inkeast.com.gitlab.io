 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to Zhao Yongde’s confession, the truth was revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Zhao Yongde left, he had a vicious smile hanging on his lips that made Su Tao furrow his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where’s Old Sun?” Just when they’re preparing to leave Dongyi Village, Jiang Qinghan noticed that the forensic doctor was missing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He had no face to stay and left.” Zhang Zhen replied in disdain. “He has always been prideful, and he was known as the cockiest forensic doctor in Hanzhou City. But Su Tao has given him a resounding slap this time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just be quiet!” Jiang Qinghan glanced around. She knew that Zhang Zhen had dissatisfaction with the forensic doctor, Old Sun. But she was the chief here, and she had to protect the harmony of the entire department.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Zhen shut his mouth with Jiang Qinghan’s words, but he smiled in an embarrassed manner. “You’re the broad-minded one not to hold any grudges!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jiang Qinghan was in the second team, she often went to get help from Old Sun. However, that fellow was extraordinarily cocky and would purposely take his time, often dragging everyone down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So since there’s an opportunity for him to humiliate Old Sun, Zhang Zhen would definitely not let it go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after a brief pondering, Jiang Qinghan was a woman, and she did not mind that. As a man, it would make him seem too petty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a grin, Zhang Zhen came to the side and started giving out orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You seem to have some thoughts!” Seeing Su Tao’s silence, Jiang Qinghan asked with her brows knitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s nothing much!” Su Tao smiled as he purposely sneezed and found a reason while rubbing his nose. “The weather is too cold!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have a coat in the car. It might be small for you, but it can still help you ward the cold.” Jiang Qinghan turned to open the trunk and took out a green coat. “It’s a habit of mine to bring a warming coat with me, since I often have to work overnight when handling cases. In cold weather, it will be easy to catch a cold if I wear less, so I always bring a coat with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had already lied, he could only gnash his teeth and follow through it. Thus, Su Tao took the coat. Although it was a little short on the arms, it still looked stylish when he didn’t button it up. There was also a fragrance coming from the coat that made Su Tao’s thoughts wander. He knew that this was definitely left behind when Jiang Qinghan wore it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, backup came from the city. The discovery of an ancient tomb even alarmed the Municipal Committee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Cultural City that was currently being built in Hanzhou City was still lacking in the highlight. So when a complete tomb of the Song Dynasty was discovered, The Secretary of the Municipal Committee, Zhang Ping, immediately gave out orders to spare at all costs and protect the integrity of the tomb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To secure the news from leaking that might cause the tomb to be excavated by others, the Municipal Committee even requested assistance from the military. Thus, the villagers of Dongyi Village were startled when they saw two military trucks drive in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Vice-Bureau Chief of Hanzhou City’s Public Security Bureau, Mei Dongcheng, who was also Jiang Qinghan’s superior, also arrived on the scene. When he saw Jiang Qinghan, his face was immediately covered in smiles. “Chief Jiang, you’ve done another great contribution!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the compliment, Jiang Qinghan modestly replied, “This is all due to everyone’s efforts!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Mei Dongcheng responded, “Your team has also contributed!” When he saw Su Tao standing beside Jiang Qinghan, he smiled and asked, “This is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was just about to introduce him to you!” Su Tao wasn’t a member of the Public Security Bureau, and Jiang Qinghan was afraid that Mei Dongcheng might have other thoughts. Hence, she immediately introduced, “This is Su Tao, you should have some impression of him, no?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, he’s Su Tao!” Mei Dongcheng took the initiative to give out a handshake and continued, “It’s all thanks to your help that the SG Chaebol’s food poisoning incident could be resolved. Could it be that the matter today also has something to do with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it wasn’t for Su Tao to commend himself, and he could only give an embarrassed smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Jiang Qinghan had the thought of giving Su Tao credit, she explained the entire situation to Mei Dongcheng while excluding the part where she was under the influence of the drug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the entire process was short, it was exciting and even made Mei Dongsheng exclaim in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a straight expression, Mei Dongcheng asked, “Little Su, are you interested in joining our Public Security Bureau?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao suavely rejected, “I have my own TCM pharmacy that I’ve inherited to manage. I’m afraid that I might not be suitable for the job.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be in such a rush to refuse me; let me explain it to you. After you join the Public Security Bureau, you’re not required to come in on a daily basis. We intend to hire some special talents this year to create a special consultant team that comprises the talents of various industries. There are too many varieties of criminal cases nowadays, such as the internet, finance, and there are many more new cases emerging. So we need some special talents to assist us.” Mei Dongcheng showed a satisfied smile and added, “Naturally, you will be paid for your service!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao turned to glance at Jiang Qinghan, and when he saw the smile on her lips, he knew that she probably had such thoughts as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When King You of Zhou tried to obtain a smile from a beauty, he even took it as far as making fun of his vassals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To please his master, it might not be a bad thing for him to enter the consultant team, and he might even have more chances to be with Jiang Qinghan. Although it might be dangerous, he could righteously pull their distance closer together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao showed a wry smile. “I’m afraid that I might not be up for the task, but I can give it a try. However, if I don’t meet the standards, please dismiss me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Mei Dongcheng nodded with a smile. “I believe in my eyesight.” When he turned around, he looked at Jiang Qinghan, “I’ll leave the consultant team to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a plan that Jiang Qinghan has suggested. Hence, she nodded her head. “I’ll follow through it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the scene being protected, aside from personnel of the City Cultural Bureau arriving in Dongyi City, the Provincial Cultural Bureau also arrived with specialists of the Antique Research Institute. Hence, this case has come to an end with the Public Security Bureau handing the matter to the other departments while Jiang Qinghan left Dongyi Village with Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is Xu Rui still annoying you?” Su Tao suddenly asked when the car drove onto the highway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s been in some trouble recently. Some employees of his injured a man and created a negative effect on the government, so they intend to cancel the qualification of his company. He’s now busy with public relations in Qiongjin City!” Jiang Qinghan replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s in Qiongjin City, but you’re still able to receive his news. It looks like your relationship is pretty extraordinary!” Su Tao locked his brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me? Do I need your approval to have interactions with anyone?” Jiang Qinghan questioned with a stern expression. She felt that Su Tao was overstepping his boundaries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just don’t feel that he’s a good man, and I’m afraid of you being cheated!” Su Tao replied as he stuttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not any good person either, so it’s not for certain who’s cheating who!” Jiang Qinghan lowered her voice as she focused on driving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, Su Tao was unhappy and wondered why Jiang Qinghan was so cold to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had no idea that Jiang Qinghan was still pissed at herself. The incident back in the tomb probably caused Su Tao to look down on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, why would he ask about Xu Rui? Perhaps he thought that she was a careless woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a deep breath, Su Tao replied, “I’m concerned about you and Yan Sha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just care about yourself!” Jiang Qinghan interrupted. “In the future, don’t bother about me and Xu Rui’s matters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Su Tao weakly sighed. He realised that he couldn’t deal with Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Jiang Qinghan was not only his master, but she’s also an officer with a fiery temper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Jiang Qinghan parked the vehicle outside the Yan Residence, Su Tao sighed the moment he stepped out and followed in. Yan Wujin was currently drinking tea in the courtyard, and when he saw Su Tao come in, he suggested, “It’s getting late now. Why don’t you stay for dinner?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao felt awkward with the sudden coldness of Jiang Qinghan’s attitude and found an excuse, “I have an appointment later, so I’ll come by next time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he got into his car, he called Lu Shimiao’s phone. Although they hadn’t met for some time, the two of them have kept in contact. Firstly, it was due to the matters in Qihuang Charity Funds, where Lu Shimiao had to seek advice from Su Tao; secondly, Su Tao had to periodically ask in regards to Little Yuan’s Aphasia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me treat you and Little Yuan to some western food!” Su Tao suggested with a smile. “With your culinary at that level, consider it as giving Little Yuan a change of taste for once.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shouldn’t you be more sincere about inviting someone? Aren’t you afraid of me rejecting your invitation?” Lu Shimiao threatened with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, your culinary skills are excellent, but you have to occasionally get a change of taste. Bringing Little Yuan to have western food can also widen her experience and be effective in treating her Aphasia.” Su Tao instantly changed his tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a baddie who sees the wind and sets the helm!” Lu Shimiao glanced at Little Yuan, who was seated in the living room watching television and replied, “Send me the address, but I might be a little late!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she hung up the phone, she hummed a tune and waved her hand at Little Yuan. “Uncle Su is going to treat us for dinner. Come, let’s dress up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Yuan’s eyes instantly lit up. She had a deep impression of Su Tao. She had been puzzling over why hadn’t he come to see them. Hence, she turned off the television with the remote control and followed Lu Shimiao into her children’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao meticulously decorated her room with wallpaper pasted over the wall, along with pieces of pink furniture and a bed. There were all sorts of children’s books on the shelf that were suitable for her age. Opening the closet, it was filled with all kinds of new clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao has put in great effort for Little Yuan since she saw a shadow of herself in the latter. Thus, she was determined to give the best to Little Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want to wear?” Lu Shimiao asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Little Yuan briefly hesitated, she pointed at the white padded jacket. As Lu Shimiao nodded her head, she knew that that was the common thought of little girls, hoping that they could be the darling of heaven like Snow White.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After changing Little Yuan, Lu Shimiao entered the master bedroom and found a white fur coat along with a pink scarf. After putting on some lip gloss, she was dazzling to the eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing beside Lu Shimiao, Little Yuan was dumbfounded before she gave out a hand sign and praised, “Mummy Lu, you’re too beautiful!”</span></p>
