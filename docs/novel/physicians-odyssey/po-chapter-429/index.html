 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she woke up the next morning, Gu Rushan noticed that she had already recovered and she couldn’t help being shocked at her neighbor’s skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although their intimate contact last night was awkward, he was ultimately trying to treat her, and she did not think too much about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, she would also be touched if she visited the hospital and was treated by a male doctor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was a crack in her heart as she had been protecting her body well from being touched by anyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So… that’s the feeling of being touched by a man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite feeling a little disgusted, it wasn’t unpleasant. On the contrary, it felt a little weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Men and women had their own needs. They had their own desires, they would imagine, and they also need comforting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The incident last night lingered on her mind when she was on the bed. Although she wanted to forget about it, she still lingered on it in the end as the sensation made her feel excited and bashful at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After changing into her exercising clothes, Gu Rushan knocked on the apartment next door. However, there wasn’t any commotion and she sighed. She knew that she was late, and Su Tao had probably gone for his morning workout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she jogged by herself for about an hour before she returned home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she noticed the missed call on her phone, she dialed back and discovered that it was a call from Ni Jingqiu, which she had forgotten to register the name in her contacts yesterday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rushan, are you free in the afternoon? I’d like to invite you and your boyfriend out for a meal.” Ni Jingqiu asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am…” Gu Rushan gnashed her teeth. It wasn’t appropriate to reject it. “But since you’ve treated me yesterday, why don’t I be the host today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re too polite in saying that.” Ni Jingqiu’s tone sounded sincere as she continued, “My boyfriend has regained his consciousness, and he insists on thanking your boyfriend. It’s just a meal, so how can it be comparable to your boyfriend saving his life?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, then!” Gu Rushan anxiously replied. She was worried that Su Tao might be missing. If that’s the case, then the meal in the afternoon would go down the drain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hanging up the call, she soon received a message on the location of their meeting. It was at a famous Chinese restaurant in Nanerhuai, which Ni Jingqiu had shown her sincerity by inviting them to this location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan immediately started to look for Su Tao’s number through her call history, but when the latter did not pick it up, she resorted to camping outside his apartment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly half an hour later, Gu Rushan finally saw Su Tao exiting the lift and sighed out in relief. She had been waiting for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve waited a long time for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the charming Gu Rushan, Su Tao smiled. “What’s wrong? Did you miss me so much after not seeing me for just a night? You wouldn’t have fallen for me, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glaring at Su Tao, Gu Rushan replied, “The other party just called and asked us out for lunch today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Su Tao indifferently replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s with that response?” Gu Rushan rolled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What response do you want from me?” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since she has waited for Su Tao for a long time, Gu Rushan was already becoming annoyed and replied, “I feel that you should be happy since you’re getting a free meal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao refuted, “I feel that someone here is the one getting the free meal. After all, I was the one who saved a life and they wanted to thank me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was instantly left choked for words and her nose became sour before her eyes turned red with tears running down her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was startled by her abrupt change. He never expected that she would cry from his teasing. Thus, he immediately appeased, “Don’t cry! Don’t worry about it; I won’t go back against my promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wiping the tears off the corner of her eyes, Gu Rushan gave a complacent smile. “That’s more like it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how she cried on demand, Su Tao bitterly smiled. Gu Rushan’s acting was really genuine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no idea that although Gu Rushan might not have majored in acting, she had been practicing every day. For an actress, crying was the foundation and they had to achieve it within five seconds. However, Gu Rushan wanted to be a level above others by crying within three seconds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she managed to cry in just three seconds, and not only were her eyes brimming with tears, but there were also tears rolling down her cheeks, which was filled with an artistic sense if it was caught on camera.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao felt that his acting skills were pretty good, but compared Gu Rushan, he felt inferior, like a baby that couldn’t lift a finger against an adult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He initially thought that she would let him off the hook after promising to her request, but he never expected that she would knock on his doors a brief moment later and sit on his couch without asking for permission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her intention was evident. She wanted to keep an eye on him so that he wouldn’t disappear since the lunch later was too important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Su Tao, this might be a patient trying to thank him. But for her, she had to grasp onto this opportunity and build a good relationship with Ni Jingqiu. After all, with the latter as her backer, she wouldn’t be far from her dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had changed into a set of stylish clothes and with the temperature around twenty, it was appropriate spring season clothing. She wore a pink blazer along with white casual trousers. When she changed her shoes, her purple socks were incredibly eye-catchy. She had evidently put an effort into her dressing. She was also wearing a pair of silver earrings that gave off a cool and able aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Natural beauties were those who were lasting to the eyes. Although Gu Rushan seemed to be delicate at the first glance, Su Tao noticed her cool and refined temperament after their interaction, which originated from the fact that she has practiced dancing and her every movement would permeate with elegance without her noticing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not intending to leave! Get me a cup of water, I’m going to die of thirst!” Gu Rushan examined. Su Tao’s apartment gave her the feeling of clean and tidy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao asked, “How about tea?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Gu Rushan decisively refused. “Only old people like to drink tea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re really not being courteous here!” Su Tao poured a glass of water for Gu Rushan before he entered the kitchen and came out with two bowls of noodles a brief moment later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re pretty meticulous to even prepare one for me, but I don’t have a habit of eating breakfast!” Gu Rushan said as she endured the appetising yellow noodles and vegetables.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not good for your stomach if you don’t eat breakfast!” Su Tao smiled. “If you refuse to eat, then I won’t go with you to lunch later!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How despicable!” Gu Rushan rolled her eyes as she started slurping the noodles. “The noodles sold in the supermarket are ordinary, I’ll make it for you next time. I guarantee that it will taste excellent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao bitterly smiled. Gu Rushan’s character was straightforward, like people from Shanzhou Province, unlike girls from Huainan Province, who were usually sweet-tempered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Gu Rushan was eating with gusto, she did not look unglamorous and cleared the bowl of noodles in just a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao sighed, “Why do you need to eat so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve still yet to integrate yourself into the rhythm of this city. Living in this city, you have to even run on the road as every minute late will put a gap between you and others. Everyone’s trying their best to seek success, so how can I take the time to enjoy life?” Gu Rushan sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao commented, “You will succeed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s hope so!” Gu Rushan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw that Su Tao was done with his meal, Gu Rushan stood up and she collected the bowls and chopsticks before she headed to the kitchen and started to wash the dishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fine details could reveal a person’s character, which Su Tao could tell that Gu Rushan was an independent woman that didn’t like to rely on others. So by treating her a bowl of noodles, she would wash the dishes to tell you that she’s not the kind of woman that reaps without sowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Su Tao came to a decision in his heart. Even if he knew that Gu Rushan might be using him, he was fine with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">We’re living in the world so that we’re valuable to others. As long as you provide sufficient benefits to others, you will have a sense of existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, his phone rang. It was an international call, and Kim Jung-ho’s voice anxiously resounded, “Physician Su, I have something that I’d like to ask you. Did my sister come and look for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nope.” Su Tao was briefly stunned as the image of Kim Jung-yeon flashed in his mind. “Don’t worry about her. She’s already an adult, and she will be fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Kim Jung-ho bitterly smiled, “Jung-yeon always wanted to come and look for you in China, and you know that the relationship between our countries is tense recently, so I’m worried that she might be in danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it, the conflict between countries won’t implicate the citizens. China’s citizens are all friendly, not to mention that Jung-yeon is also proficient with Mandarin, so it won’t be a problem.” Su Tao comforted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll leave my sister to you.” Kim Jung-ho sincerely made his request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao smiled. “Don’t worry about it, she’s the founder of my fan club, and I will definitely do my best to protect her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s something that I’d like to remind you.” Kim Jung-ho lowered his voice and continued, “By handing her to you, I’m talking about like brothers and sisters. Don’t try anything with her!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know! I have a taste.” Su Tao replied half-heartedly as Kim Jung-ho was really too excessively worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But hearing Su Tao’s words, Kim Jung-ho instantly became unhappy and questioned, “What do you mean? Is my sister not outstanding enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao laughed as he changed the topic, “Now that our two countries are in a tense relationship, it’s unavoidable for there to be a divergence in our conversation, so let us cut things short. I will take good care of Kim Jung-yeon, and you can just send me her mobile number later. Oh, how’s the situation in South Korea?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a deep breath, Kim Jungho helplessly replied, “The female president was impeached, and the Kwon Family has been weakened. There’s also a boycotting activity in the country as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, wouldn’t you be affected by it?” Su Tao locked his brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nope! On the contrary, my business bloomed instead!” Kim Jung-ho awkwardly smiled before sighing. “I have a lot of customers from China, and I’m also in an awkward position!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao roughly understood Kim Jung-ho’s meaning, since there were many Chinese in South Korea. Now that the two countries were in a tense relationship, the business of a medical center that bears the sign of a pharmacy from China naturally bloomed since it attracted many Chinese who were staying in South Korea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Medical studies are not restricted by boundary!” Kim Jung-ho continued. “In my eyes, there are only patients, and I will do my best to treat them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao shook his head and smiled. “I don’t agree with you on this point. On this matter, I will absolutely not treat anyone that holds prejudice against my country, since I am a physician. It was the culture inheritance for the past thousands of years that gave me the ability to make a living, and I can’t possibly use it to nurture my enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho fell into an awkward silence before he wryly smiled. “You’ve given me a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s why we can never be friends!” Su Tao sighed in regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this matter, Kim Jung-ho also sighed. Even if his medical center hung the signboard of the Three Flavour Hall from his loss, he still failed to dispel the guard in Su Tao’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Kim Jung-ho knew about this well, since he was having ideas about Su Tao’s Heavenseizing Hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hanging the call, Su Tao soon received a message, which he gave a call according to the number that was sent over. However, the call was denied after two rings and he sent a message over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A brief moment later, Kim Jung-yeon immediately called him back.</span></p>
