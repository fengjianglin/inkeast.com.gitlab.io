 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While leaving the stage, Su Tao left a bunch of people behind. The host still wanted to interview Su Tao and share his thoughts about this victory, but Su Tao did not feel the necessity for it. He had already proven his strength by winning, and he might stir trouble if he said anything. After all, this wasn’t his home ground. As the saying goes, disaster originates from the mouth. There’s no lack of ferocious characters in South Korea, and he didn’t want to get involved in any trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking over, Murong Hong wore an amiable smile on his face. His attitude had completely changed at this moment. Looking at the former, Su Tao had also buried the hatchet. Truth be told, he would also suspect himself if he was in Murong Hong’s shoes and worried that TCM might suffer another blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I apologise for the words I’ve spoken earlier!” Murong Hong gave a deep bow towards Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao immediately supported Murong Hong and replied, “Senior Murong, I can’t accept this bow from you. I can understand your previous concern, and it’s also because of your motivation that steeled my confidence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Murong Hong had tears welling up in his eyes as he sighed, “Su Tao, aside from apologising to you, I’m also thanking you. Your performance today brought honor back to TCM. It’s fulfilling to see how you brought the honor that Kim Jung-ho took from us last year back. You’ve brought glory to the country and TCM, so I naturally have to declare my position.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a modest smile, Su Tao replied, “Senior Murong, I can feel your heart. Old Song and Old Dou have told me about you being an honest person, and even I felt admiration for what you’ve done for TCM.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Murong Hong felt that Su Tao’s character was simple. The latter had a clear differentiation between black and white. He’s someone who would give respect upon receiving it. On the contrary, he would retaliate if you insult him in the face. Someone like him wasn’t hateful, especially when it’s a capable young man. Thus, he couldn’t help but gently pat Su Tao’s shoulder and promised, “Old Song and Old Dou have been trying to persuade me into join the TCM Alliance, and I’ve agreed to it now. From tomorrow onwards, I will do my part in developing the TCM Alliance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon receiving this news, Su Tao couldn’t help smiling before letting out a sigh, “If Senior Murong is willing to join the TCM Alliance, I believe many people will follow your lead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The TCM Association is too stiff, and they no longer seek to develop. They’re lacking in the power to rally supporters and loyalty. Old Song has a vision that the development of the TCM Alliance will bring a powerful driving force for TCM’s inheritance and promotion.” Murong Hong confidently smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao and Murong Hong could be said to have created a friendship through discord. Despite the contradiction they had in the past, the knot between them had been resolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason for it was simple, Murong Hong’s wrath lied in Su Tao’s arrogance to represent TCM and challenge TKM. But the reality has proven that Su Tao actually was that capable and obtained a victory without any suspense. Since he could force his prideful enemy into admitting defeat, it was no longer arrogance, but confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Murong Hong left, he was in a great mood. Although this was a distinguished meeting for Western Medicine, he felt every single one of his steps were sonorous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason was simple. TCM was proven to be effective in treating tumours. Even if not everyone possessed that skill, it proved that TCM had an indispensable position in modern medicine.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The specialist from the Netherlands, Bath, glanced at Gillette. The latter was still in shock, and even the contempt that was on his face has disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am I seeing things right? Such a long needle actually treated the tumour in the intestines? It must be a scam!” Gillette was still reluctant to accept this fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Traditional medical inheritance has its own speciality, and I’ve decided to research TCM. Gillette, do you want to cooperate with me?” Bath smiled. With the truth laid before their eyes, Gillette had been fully convinced by Su Tao’s skills, despite his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I definitely must research TCM. But, I’m doing it in the hope of exposing the sham of TCM!” Gillette proudly declared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright then, how much are you going to invest in the research?” Gillette teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A million euros! No wait, make it two million!” Gillette said with a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a miracle for a miser like you to make such a generous decision.” Bath had a good relationship with Gillette. Although the two of them had different nationalities, they often contacted each other through emails.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them made a huge decision today; researching TCM from the angle of Western Medicine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Kim Jung-yeon was feeling complicated in her heart. Even if she was the administrator behind Su Tao’s fan club, she couldn’t help feeling depressed when she saw her grandfather and brother’s expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps she had expected that her brother would lose to Su Tao, but she never expected that it would be in such a direct manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The competition gave everyone the conception that Kim Jung-ho and Su Tao weren’t on the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was akin to solving a mathematical equation. No matter how Kim Jung-ho pondered on the arithmetic, Su Tao already had a more advanced calculation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference in level determined that the competition was one-sided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at her phone, Kim Jung-yeon noticed that there were many fans cheering for their idol’s victory. Letting out a weak sigh, she said, “The live broadcast will stop here, and Su Tao has ended the competition with a victory! Thank you all for supporting Su Tao!”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Liu Ruochen was a spectator, she couldn’t help feeling her blood boiling while standing beside Su Tao. The latter had convinced everyone with his skills. As someone in the TCM industry, she felt pride surging in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You won. Good job!” Liu Ruochen calmly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fortunate that I did not disappoint you.” Su Tao whispered in Liu Ruochen’s ears. Looking from another angle, it looked as if Su Tao was kissing Liu Ruochen on the cheek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This action was seen by Wang Guofeng, or putting it in another way, Su Tao did it on purpose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng’s countenance was drained of colour with all the anger pent in his heart without any ventilation. The reason was simple; he lost to Kim Jung-ho, and Su Tao came out like a messiah and regained the honour of TCM that he lost. This moment had become Wang Guofeng’s humiliation. Or perhaps, it cannot even be considered a humiliation; his glory had all been taken by Su Tao with him turning into a supporting character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As someone with meticulous thoughts, Liu Ruochen rolled her eyes at Su Tao. “Is there a meaning in doing this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao replied, “That’s the stance of a victor; cheering from the audience and winning the heart of a beauty. How can this get any better?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Liu Ruochen replied, “You’ve truly become famous now. Now, you have to be cautious with your future actions!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not that cowardly.” Su Tao smiled proudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know that you’re courageous, but you have to consider the others. If someone saw what you did, wouldn’t I become your scandalous girlfriend?” Liu Ruochen gently smiled. “I don’t want to be in the headlines!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finding a reason in her logic, Su Tao helplessly smiled. At this moment, Liu Ruochen stood up and left. Just when he wanted to chase after her, he was obstructed by Kim Han-joo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nice to meet you, Su Tao!” Kim Han-joo took the initiative for a handshake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nice to meet you too, Senior Kim!” As the victor, Su Tao had to maintain a gentlemanly bearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. My Kim Family will not renege on our promise. We will replace the signboard of our medical centre with the Three Flavour Hall!” Although Kim Han-joo wasn’t fluent in his pronunciation, his voice was clear and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll get someone to send the Three Flavour Hall’s logo to Kim Jung-ho. I’ll have to ask you to generalise it!” Su Tao also wasn’t polite, since it was something that he won.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a hint of bitterness flashing in Kim Han-joo’s eyes, he replied, “Sure! But I have another suggestion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please, speak your mind!” An old fox was cunning, and Su Tao had already expected something from Kim Han-joo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the day comes when Kim Jung-ho exceeds you in his medical skills, I hope that you can allow our medical centre to regain our own signboard.” Kim Han-joo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure!” Su Tao smiled. “But I won’t give Kim Jung-ho that opportunity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile rose on Kim Han-joo’s lips. Su Tao was someone worthy of his respect, despite the difference in their nationality. As someone who researched TCM for a long time, Kim Han-joo was filled with admiration and respect when he saw the Heavenseizing Hands appearing in the world once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, there were no classifications in medical studies, since all of them shared a common enemy ⁠— diseases.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenseizing Hands has performed a miracle, and it’s the bane of diseases. Hence, Su Tao was a breakthrough to traditional medical studies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Kim Han-joo thought deeper about it. If Kim Jung-ho could interact with Su Tao, the former would have an opportunity to learn the Heavenseizing Hands. If that’s the case, then the Kim Family’s inheritance of TCM would grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thereafter, Su Tao and Liu Ruochen left the summit together. He had already completed his task here, with a load in his heart relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fans that have been waiting here for a long time rushed over, so the security team immediately came up and surrounded Su Tao and Liu Ruochen, opening a path for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they finally came out, there was a black vehicle with three robust men coming out. The leading one wore sunglasses. He tossed the half-burnt cigarette in his mouth and walked towards Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the three of them pouncing over ferociously, Su Tao was worried that Liu Ruochen might be in danger and whispered, “There are too many people here. You head back to the hotel first, and I’ll come looking for you later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Liu Ruochen was stunned by his words, Su Tao suddenly quickened his pace and quickly strode towards his right. The three robust men also moved and chased after Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Ruochen’s first response was that Su Tao might be in danger, and he purposely distanced himself from her to keep her safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Liu Ruochen made the decision to chase after the three men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao guessed that those three coming after him should be related to the Kwon Family, and they were naturally after him. Aside from Liu Ruochen, who was beside him, there were also a large group of fans. Thus, he could only lure the three men away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao quickened his steps, the three men were having a tough time keeping up. In just a brief moment, the three of them were already gasping for air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing that it’s impossible for them to catch up at this rate, the leader amongst the three men pulled out a pistol from his waist and fired a shot into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the gunshot echoed, Su Tao stopped and turned around, facing the three men. He knew that despite his speed, it’s impossible for him to be faster than bullets.</span></p>
