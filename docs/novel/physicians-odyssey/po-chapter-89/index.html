 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 89 - Heart Talk in the Suite</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao lost her centre of gravity while her shoulder was being embraced. She suddenly reacted like ants in a hot wok as she violently struggled, taking two steps back before turning around and glared at Su Tao with rage flashing in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s smile looked hateful in her eyes. He seemed pleased with himself as he said, “Don’t be nervous, I’m just proving that our relationship isn’t as simple as colleagues. Furthermore, our relationship as friends is absolutely pure, so don’t get the wrong idea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sourly staring at Su Tao, Lu Shimiao gently stomped her right foot on the ground before she turned around and ran off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her posture was beautiful when she was running and her booty had danced violently. Due to the thin pyjamas, Su Tao could see the outline of her undergarment, along with a vague crack in between.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, Su Tao was also under control of his emotions when he tugged Lu Shimiao. Having such a bewitching woman beside him, along with such a massive presidential suite, no one would believe them, even if they said nothing happened between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao hesitated when he saw the panic in Lu Shimiao’s eyes. She wasn’t rejecting him, but her eyes looked like there wasn’t any sense of security. It was akin to a deer that was terrified while it was feeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lu Shimiao entered her room, she immediately locked the door and leaned against it with her heart violently throbbing. In that instant, when she fell on Su Tao, she hesitated and struggled in her heart, along with the existing panic and nervousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was a smart woman, and her environment made her independent. She knew her current situation, even if her relationship with Qiao Bo was broken, they’re still husband and wife in name. So she definitely couldn’t do it as it was the bottom line of her morality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, she was also much older than Su Tao. Even if she got together with Su Tao, it’s merely to satisfy the physiological needs, and such a relationship wouldn’t last long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With heavy footsteps, Lu Shimiao took two steps forth before she collapsed on her bed. The bed was incredibly soft. She could feel her body being brought up to the air a little from the springs. She felt discomfort in her chest, so she adjusted her posture. She turned around, staring at the chandelier that hung on the ceiling and closed her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As exhaustion corroded her consciousness, she suddenly opened her eyes and felt a burning aura in her body that made her throat itch and her mouth dry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao sighed before she helplessly stood up and opened the door to the room. She did not immediately go out, but briefly watched the commotion in the living room. After seeing that there didn’t seem to be anyone there, only then did she walk out to the liquor cabinet and pour herself a glass of red wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red wine tasted sour, but it was immensely quenching. She gulped it down and instantly felt the heat in her body settle down before pouring herself a second glass. She drank the second glass even faster than the first with a sweet sensation left on the corner of her lips. Wiping the wine that was left on her lips, she drank the third glass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the third glass entered her stomach, she felt her legs going soft. With one hand holding the bottle of wine and another on the glass, she sat back on the couch, while she subconsciously asked herself if she was drunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao, get out!” Lu Shimiao yelled as she slammed her hand on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only roughly ten-odd minutes later when Su Tao’s head peek out of the door and he looked at Lu Shimiao in shock. “What’s wrong? Holy, why are you drinking so much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking drunk, Lu Shimiao raised her finger and hooked it, along with a bewitching smile. “Come, drink with me.” When she finished speaking, she had a hiccup and smiled foolishly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao shrugged his shoulders. It was still 9 p.m., and he initially thought that Lu Shimiao had fallen asleep and that it would be an endless night without anything to do. So he had no reason to refuse Lu Shimiao’s request to drink together. “Sure, let’s have a drink, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Won’t it affect your competition tomorrow?” Lu Shimiao asked with concern after she abruptly slapped her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The competition in the morning is already practically in my pocket.” After Chu Huilin relinquishes from the competition, Su Tao would be able to proceed without having to battle. As for the one in the afternoon, he still had no idea of his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a bottle of brandy along with several bottles of mixers, Lu Shimiao snatched it from him before he could pour it. “I want to drink it pure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a bitter smile, Su Tao could already see that Lu Shimiao was a little drunk. “Drinking it pure makes it easy to get drunk. You must be mentally prepared that I won’t wait upon you if you’re drunk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who needs you?” Lu Shimiao changed the glass and poured herself half a cup of brandy before tossing cubes of ice in it. Taking a sip, despite it’s burning taste, she said otherwise from her lips, “How comfortable!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao helplessly sighed, since he wasn’t a stranger to Lu Shimiao in this state. Despite her cold appearance, she was actually a passionate woman in her heart. Raising his cup and bumped with hers, the back of his hand came in contact with her fingers that felt especially wonderful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Su Tao said, “Alcohol can numb a person. The comfort is merely a façade. You will know the meaning of pain when you sober up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao swirled the cup in her hand. The ice cubes knocked against the glass, emanating a crisp sound. She sighed with a lost gaze, “I also have no idea when I got indulged in alcohol. As a doctor, I know that excessive alcohol will cause a side effect, but I’m still reluctant to give up that moment of relaxation that alcohol gives me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao filled Lu Shimiao’s cup again and smiled. “Relax occasionally, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking another big gulp, Lu Shimiao cast Su Tao a glance. “Actually, I know that you’re not that different from other guys. You’re just trying to approach me so that you can get in bed with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should understand this concept. Most of the guys around a beautiful woman aren’t pure.” Su Tao awkwardly smiled while shrugging his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao sighed, “Is there no pure friendship, then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head with a smile, Su Tao replied, “If the two of us keep it under control and stop our relationship from taking further developments, we will be able to maintain our status as friends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao gave a burst of exaggerated laughter as she answered, “I will control it, I’m just afraid that you won’t be able to. I was really startled when you tugged me earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao gently breathed out and smiled. “You’re afraid because you’re worried that you cannot control the restlessness in your heart, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Lu Shimiao’s gaze got lost in her thoughts, before she said, “Our hearts are all made of meat, and I have a bottom line in my heart. It’s just that I don’t know when that bottom line will be lowered. You’re handsome, talented and protective of me. If I kept up with a cold attitude against you, then I’m an abnormal person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao did not expect Lu Shimiao to talk it all out when she’s drunk. What’s going on? Were they going to be frank about everything?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Lu Shimiao continued to narrate her story, “When I was 8, I asked the Dean why I didn’t have any parents, unlike everyone else. The Dean told me that I was more beautiful and intelligent than everyone else, because I had too much with me, so I was unlike others.” Lu Shimiao continued to sigh, “Say, wasn’t the Dean smart?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao nodded in agreement. “Also a very kind person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When I was 16, the Dean suddenly passed away. At that time, I thought to myself that I must become a doctor so that I could save the Dean. But can a dead person be saved? Isn’t it ridiculous?” Lu Shimiao smiled while wiping the tears off the corner of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed, he looked at Lu Shimiao and responded in a soft voice, “You’re not ridiculous at all. The reason why someone wants to grow stronger is so that they can protect those close to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao turned to look at Su Tao. “Back then, when I married Qiao Bo, it wasn’t because of love. I just thought that his circumstances were pretty good, and he even had a powerful father. So that’s the reason why I married him, so that I could develop further in the hospital. Aren’t I realistic?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao shook his head as he comforted, “Your choice isn’t wrong. Marriage to a woman is akin to a second life, everyone wants to change their fate, so they choose men with a background so that they can shield them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lifting her hair and revealing her pearly-white ears, Lu Shimiao helplessly said, “It’s only a pity that I misjudged. Qiao Bo is, after all, someone living in the shadow of his father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You still have a chance to make a choice.” Su Tao responded with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao’s eyes beamed while nodding her head. “You’re right, I met you. You even brought changes to my life. I suddenly realised the endless possibilities of the future. In the past, I acted so cold just to hide the inferiority in my heart. I have always felt that the reason why my marriage failed was because of me. I’m an orphan, so I’m afraid of becoming alone all again, becoming someone without any family again. But right now, I understood that if I have a family that isn’t warm, it’ll just bring me pain.”</span></p>

I only feel that you’re pretty, so I can’t help wanting to get close to you. As for the other things, it’s only because we’re fated.”</span></p>

 <p>Well, I've noticed quite a bit of moral questions rising here and there.<br>Just to tell you guys to chill a little xD Discussions are fine, but just don't develop it into a moral argument.<br>It's still fine so far, but I thought I should just pop it here. After all, there's already a disclaimer in the synopsis to warn moralist.<br><br>There are also people questioning the quality of the novel and stuff like that. I would say that it's personal opinion, and no, this isn't a novel dumped to me by Wuxiaworld but something I've chosen.<br>I'm a no-brainer for TCM + Martial Arts, has been a huge fan of such genres since young. But I have to say that this novel is really interesting, at least in terms of the conversation between characters and the face-slapping action.</p>
