 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone has their own secrets, and the reason why Su Tao did not share it with anyone was that it wasn’t exactly a glorious past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it wasn’t pleasant, why not toss it to the back of his mind and start a new life?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was studying Song Sichen’s medical notes, Yan Jing called and invited him to dinner, in which he agreed since it has been a long time since he last saw Hua Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was genuinely fond of Hua Yan, and this could be considered as loving the house, love its crow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Making a stop by a supermarket, Su Tao picked up two sets of toys. He bought a set of dolls and a set of mermaid. It was pretty much common knowledge that girls are fonder of cute dolls, while boys are fonder of weaponry toys, a discrepancy caused by physiology. For a girl like Hua Yan, these two toys are extremely attractive for her, and it was also suitable for a girl’s nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After making the purchases, Su Tao drove to the Golden Bay. When he arrived, Hua Yan was waiting outside the door. When Su Tao got out of the vehicle and retrieved the toys from the front-passenger seat, Hua Yan’s eyes sparkled as she ran in the direction of Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it was still drizzling, the ground was slippery so she slipped and fell on the ground from her frantic running. However, she soon got up on her feet and brushed her knees before smiling at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a complicated sigh, Su Tao felt heartache for her fall, but at the same time, he was also gratified by Hua Yan’s improvements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bending down, Su Tao picked Hua Yan up and saddled her on his shoulders. Receiving the toy’s packaging from Su Tao, Hua Yan incessantly chuckled with her tender legs swinging around before Su Tao. Deep in his heart, Su Tao felt that the hearts of girls were really pure since they would openly display their feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Yan Jing heard the commotion outside, she came out of the villa. Looking at her, Su Tao was briefly stunned as the infamous Venomous Widow of Huainan Province was actually wearing a cartoon apron!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her hair was draped over her shoulders with a faint tint of a healthy rose colour on her cheeks. Despite the apron wrapping around her body, it couldn’t conceal her outstanding figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was like a fermented Nuerhong Wine, which left a rich aftertaste due to her past experiences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She doesn’t like any toys at home!” Yan Jing helplessly sighed and even felt a little depressed. To win over her daughter, she created a room filled with all sorts of toys. However, Hua Yan wasn’t too interested in them, but she was so easily captivated by the two toys that Su Tao bought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the reliance that her daughter had for Su Tao, Yan Jing felt gratified and helpless at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That depends on the person, am I right, Hua Yan?” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Yan went along with it as she waved the toys in the direction of Yan Jing, which the latter sourly rolled her eyes and returned to the kitchen. “I’m personally cooking today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking another glance at Yan Jing’s silhouette, Su Tao felt warm in his heart. Not only has Hua Yan changed, but even Yan Jing has also changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Yan Jing lived in hatred, so she was ruthless and vicious when handling matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But with Hua Yan entering her life, her motherly love returned. Although she was still ruthless and vicious, there was occasionally a touch of human warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was in the past, Yan Jing wouldn’t have dealt with Xu Rui so gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arriving at the living room, Hua Yan excitedly tore open the packaging and stripped the clothes off the doll.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But soon after, she was stunned since she has no idea how to put the clothes back on. Hence, she could only look at Su Tao with puppy eyes to seek his help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao did not help her directly but slowly guided her, which Hua Yan ultimately put the clothes back on the barbie doll. Although there were a few sections that seemed awkward, Hua Yan felt satisfied as she removed the clothes once more before dressing the doll again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stripping and dressing the doll, Hua Yan was engrossed in the joy of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For kids, their happiness was that simple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it was time for dinner, Yan Jing’s best friend, Qin Meimei, came over. When she saw Su Tao here as well, she feigned awkwardness as she covered her mouth in astonishment. “Oops, if I knew that you’re here, then I wouldn’t have come to disrupt your happiness!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rolling her eyes, Yan Jing laughed, “But you didn’t seem to sound that way through the phone. When you heard that Su Tao was coming, you immediately insisted on coming over as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a gentle snort, Qin Meimei removed her coat, revealing her low-collared woolen shirt and pantingly said, “So what? Are you going to throw me out? I’m all alone now, and I can’t stand others being lovey-dovey the most!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing was teased as her shoulders trembled from her laughter, “Why don’t you go and find new love? There are so many opportunities in Aqua Brook, and I’m sure you can find someone suitable for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Turning to Hua Yan, Qin Meimei nudged her lips and snorted, “Is this how you educate children?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words left Yan Jing briefly stunned before she kept her mouth shut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing was no longer the same as she was when Su Tao met her for the first time. Before her daughter, Yan Jing was a gentle mother who paid attention to her speech and actions since she knew that children learn from adults.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Qin Meimei and Yan Jing arguing, Su Tao knew that he couldn’t join this matter, or he would become the common target. Hence, he could only whisper to Hua Yan while occasionally putting vegetables into her bowl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she looked at those vegetables, Hua Yan hesitated and knitted her brows before shoving a few of them into her mouth before looking at Su Tao with puppy eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in response to her reaction, Su Tao’s expression turned solemn, which Hua Yan could only swallow those vegetables down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Meimei watched the whole scene and sighed, “I never expected that Su Tao would have such a technique at dealing with kids!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a gentle sigh, Yan Jing shared, “Hua Yan doesn’t like to eat vegetables normally, and I’m also having a headache about this issue. So how did you get her to eat them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao smiled. “I naturally have my own ways. I told her that if she doesn’t eat any vegetables, she will turn into an ugly duck in the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So easily?” Yan Jing smiled wryly after a brief stun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re too soft on Hua Yan. Although you’ve regained her after losing her, you still have to teach her well.” Su Tao patiently pointed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Hua Yan heard Su Tao’s words, she suddenly raised her head and glared at Su Tao before letting out a snort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her response made Su Tao smile as Hua Yan’s ego was stronger than he had imagined, based on how easily she became angry with a tactful criticism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crawling up from the chair, Hua Yan no longer cared about Su Tao. Seeing her tantrum, Su Tao smiled and gave an eye signal to Yan Jing to not bother about Hua Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hua Yan was, after all, a little girl. So how could she win against adults? Hence, she would secretly peek at Su Tao, wanting to get comfort from him. However, Su Tao purposely toughened his heart and didn’t look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After their meal, Su Tao quietly sneaked behind Hua Yan before suddenly picking her up and spun her in the air. In the beginning, Hua Yan was startled, but after realising that Su Tao was messing with her, she started chuckling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how Hua Yan and Su Tao played on the side, a gentle smile hung on Yan Jing’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing her changes, Qin Meimei pursed her lips together. “Shit, you fell for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What nonsense are you talking about?” Yan Jing glared at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve all been through that phase, so you don’t have to be shy!” Qin Meimei took a deep breath. “It’s good having someone you like. I already have no idea how that feels anymore!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Yan Jing analysed, “It seems like that tycoon hurt you too deeply.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a sad expression, Qin Meimei gently sighed, “I have no idea when, but I actually don’t feel that hurt breaking up with him. Perhaps I’ve already lost feelings for him long ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t have any feelings for him, why would you persevere for so many years?” Yan Jing exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When we broke up, I came to understand that what I loved from the beginning was his talent. I felt that he was warm, gentlemanly, and understanding. But after that, I came to love his money more.” As if she was encouraging herself, Qin Meimei said in determination, “In the future, I can’t live with that much greed for money anymore!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Yan Jing knew that Qin Meimei was bullshitting. She had deep feelings for that tycoon. Li Yede was a cunning expert in romance, who had been using love to hold onto Qin Meimei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Women tend to have a unique feeling for the man that took their virginity. Even if Li Yede was cunning in how he obtained Qin Meimei’s virginity, Qin Meimei still waited so many years for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Su Tao playing with Hua Yan, Yan Jing and Qin Meimei took some alcohol and went up to the balcony to chat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were initially just partners, but ever since Qin Meimei broke up with Li Yede, the two’s relationship got closer and progressed in the direction of best friends. At the same time, Qin Meimei looked for Yan Jing to drink more often as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was in the past, where Yan Jing was a thorny rose, she definitely wouldn’t allow Qin Meimei to get too close to her. But ever since her daughter returned, the two’s relationship got better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Hua Yan was exhausted, she actually fell asleep in Su Tao’s embrace, which he carried her to her room and put blankets on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he came to the balcony, Su Tao was briefly stunned. It had only been half an hour, but the two of them had drunk a little too much and were indolently sitting at the table. Under the hazy lights on the balcony, the two of them created a gorgeous scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the two of them sat together, Yan Jing seemed more outstanding in terms of appearance with her exquisite nose bridge and ample figure. On the other hand, Qin Meimei was skinny, but her facial features were more seductive. She had thick makeup on, and her every action would permeate charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While silently admiring the two of them, Su Tao couldn’t help having his heart ripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Su, come and drink!” Qin Meimei bewitchingly looked over and licked her rosy lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t the two of you drinking a little too much?” Su Tao furrowed his brows together and refused, “Don’t drink too much; it’s not good for women to touch alcohol often as it will cause premature aging!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nonsense!” Qin Meimei stood up and walked over. But due to the intoxication of alcohol, she was staggering her way and practically pounced on Su Tao. “Yan Jing, come and help me. This fellow is too heavy, and I can’t drag him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling that the sensation of Qin Meimei’s hands wandering on his body felt ticklish, Su Tao couldn’t hold back his smile. “Are you dragging me here? You’re clearly just wrapping yourself around me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stinking brat, you actually dared to take advantage of me?” Qin Meimei’s interest rose as she started framing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing to the side, Yan Jing gently took a sip on the wine with a gentle smile. It was as if she enjoyed the scene of Qin Meimei teasing Su Tao.</span></p>
