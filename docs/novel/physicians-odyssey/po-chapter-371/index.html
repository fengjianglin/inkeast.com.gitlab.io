 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Bai Fan left the room, Wang Guofeng came into the room when he heard a commotion. He saw that Zhang Ailian was fully dressed and she looked panicked with the lamp rolling down the bedside cabinet. Taking a deep breath, Wang Guofeng walked over and smiled. “It was a friend of mine!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A friend? How can he enter your room as he wishes?” Zhang Ailian cautiously asked as she felt her face burning. She was feeling as if she was fully bare in public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing her question, Wang Guofeng immediately started to lie, “This room was booked by him since he has some status here. Last night, I missed you too much and gave you a call to come over to Hanzhou City. However, he didn’t know about it and became worried after seeing that I still wasn’t awake, so he got the card from the reception counter. We can only blame the fact that the two of us slept too well last night without any alertness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng was now an expert in lies, as his ability to create a story was simply unparalleled without any stuttering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at Wang Guofeng with a complicated gaze, Zhang Ailian sighed with a wry smile. “Guofeng, let’s not meet in secret anymore in the future. I was really nervous and felt that my heart would explode at any moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With bitterness in Wang Guofeng’s eyes, he gently held onto Zhang Ailian’s hand. “Ailian, you can’t be so ruthless to me! You know how much I’m infatuated with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pause, a wry smile rose on the corner of Zhang Ailian’s lips. “I love you too, but I already have a family. We can only blame the heavens for letting us get to know each other so late, and we’re not fated!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slapping himself in the face, Wang Guofeng’s eyes turned red. His actions startled Zhang Ailian before she immediately held onto Wang Guofeng’s hands. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bitter smile was plastered on Wang Guofeng’s lips as he mocked himself, “I can only blame myself for being so useless that I can’t even pursue the girl I love!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhang Ailian caressed Wang Guofeng’s cheeks, she felt her nose sour with tears rolling down. “I’m sorry, Guofeng. Please don’t think of it that way…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head forcefully, Wang Guofeng replied, “I can’t accept this fact. If you leave me, then I will die before you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Zhang Ailian was utterly startled by Wang Guofeng’s acting and immediately hugged him. “Guofeng, don’t do this. I promise you that I will never leave you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Guofeng placed his chin on Zhang Ailian’s shoulder while caressing her soft hair gently, Zhang Ailian couldn’t see a smile creeping on Wang Guofeng’s lips. It was a smile filled with satisfaction and intoxication.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng had now become an excellent conman. His acting skill could grasp onto the heart of the other party. In addition to his background, social status, along with the image that he had accumulated in the past, Zhang Ailian would never think that Wang Guofeng was only enjoying the process of subduing a married woman, not her as a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng first brought Zhang Ailian to a famous restaurant in Hanzhou City, the Spring Pleasure Pavilion, for their breakfast before leaving. After they left the highway, Zhang Ailian requested Wang Guofeng to drop her by the roadside as they go on their separate ways to prevent them from being seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wang Guofeng felt that it was good having a married woman as his secret relationship as secrecy was extremely important to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was barefooted while she wore shoes. So if this matter was exposed, she would have more to lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Range Rover drove, a black vehicle slowly approached Zhang Ailian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, charming, how are you? May I ask, how do I get to Sunshine Road?” The window wound down as Xia Yu asked while removing his sunglasses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s very far from here, and you won’t understand my description. If you have a phone, you can navigate the map!” Zhang Ailian held her guard up against Xia Yu by instinct, since she often gets pickups due to her extraordinary appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu looked rough and even looked like a mobster. Hence, he triggered Zhang Ailian’s disgust by instinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, babe! Are you waiting for a cab? Where are you going? I can bring you over as long as you’re willing to guide me!” Xia Yu chewed on a piece of chewing gum as he continued to worm his way in with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need!” Zhang Ailian saw a cab from afar. She ran over and flagged it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being rejected, Xia Yu did not feel awkward but squinted his eyes and fiddled with the camera beside him before turning to Su Tao, who was seated in the backseat. “Wang Guofeng is truly a cautious person to leave his lover behind by the highway intersection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sourly smiled. “It’s fine if you’re following them, but why did you go strike up a conversation! Aren’t you afraid of revealing yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a complacent smile, Xia Yu responded, “Life is meaningless without any surprises. Don’t worry about it, that woman is more nervous than I am right now. She had an affair, and her heart is sensitive. She was afraid of being recognised by anyone who can reveal her identity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao responded, “Do all private investigators have such peculiar tastes? Knowing that others had a private affair, they would still want to probe to seek excitement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu chuckled, “Can’t help it. All humans have their occupational illnesses. However, this can only be used once, so I did not drive my usual car. Otherwise, I won’t be able to continue my work anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao pondered for a long time while caressing his chin, he instructed, “There must be a plan for Bai Fan and Wang Guofeng to meet. You must surely keep an eye on Wang Guofeng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. It’s all within my control, and I’ll go lay out a trap later. Wang Guofeng has too many holes at this moment, and it’s easy to gather his evidence!” Xia Yu smiled confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling that there was something amiss, Su Tao reminded, “I have an ill omen that something is about to happen!”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wang Guofeng returned to Qiongjin City, he purposely strayed from contacting Mo Sun’er for a week until she sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cliffhanging was a common tactic used to woo girls. Only when she’s thinking about you and noticed that you’ve suddenly distanced away from her, she would take the initiative to approach you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his phone rang, Wang Guofeng smiled as he picked it up and pretended to be busy, “Sun’er, what’s the matter? I’m sorry, but I have been busy recently! I have a few critically ill patients to treat, which was the reason why I haven’t been contacting you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I see!” Mo Sun’er awkwardly smiled. “I thought that you’ve come to hate me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hate? How is that possible?” After a brief pause, Wang Guofeng asked, “Oh, right. You mentioned that you’re coming to play in Qiongjin City over the weekend. When are you coming? I’ll go and pick you up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Mo Sun’er was relieved that her Senior Brother still had her in his heart and responded, “I’m coming together with Xiao Jingjing. But if you’re busy, then there’s no need to bother with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is that possible?” Wang Guofeng waved his hand. “You must tell me beforehand. Otherwise, I will be angry with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Mo Sun’er felt honey coating her heart. She had mustered her courage for a long time before calling Wang Guofeng because she had been hesitating due to Wang Guofeng’s attitude. However, Wang Guofeng’s voice made her feel relieved that he was still that gentleman. After a brief pondering, she added, “Oh, there’s something that I have to remind you. Jingjing doesn’t seem to have any good impression of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Wang Guofeng replied, “Xiao Jingjing has marvelous talent, and she had obtained a good achievement back then in the internal competition of the Jiangnan TCM University. I have a good impression of her, and I even wanted to invite her over to study at the main branch of the university. However, she rejected my invitation. Perhaps there’s a misunderstanding between her and me, but it’s nothing. My breadth of mind isn’t that small.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a breath in relief, Mo Sun’er pursed her lips and smiled. “Then I’m reassured. I’ll contact you at that time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she hung the call, Mo Sun’er proudly smiled at Xiao Jingjing. “You must take some time out! I’ve already made an appointment with my Senior Brother for him to treat us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xiao Jingjing was in an awkward position as she responded, “Then I’ll seek master’s opinion about it. Three Flavour Hall has a good business, especially on the weekends. There will be many customers, and wouldn’t it be chaotic if we left?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your mind is all about Su Tao!” Mo Sun’er jabbed Xiao Jingjing’s head as she insisted, “I don’t care! You have to follow me to Qiongjin City!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What am I going there for?” Xiao Jingjing sourly said. “I don’t want to be a third-wheel!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha!” Mo Sun’er laughed. “I’m calling you over as my shield in case my Senior Brother does anything irrational!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words left Xiao Jingjing speechless and she sourly glared at Mo Sun’er. “Stop messing around, or I’ll tell your Senior Sister about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Mo Sun’er heard about Liu Ruochen, her face instantly withered and she begged, “My dearest friend, I believe you won’t betray me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a wry smile, Xiao Jingjing sighed, “I will request for leave from master. But there’s nothing I can do if he doesn’t approve it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If he doesn’t approve, then we’ll just go on strike! That tyrant, I’ll see who will work for him in the future!” Mo Sun’er arrogantly declared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, her words made Xiao Jingjing’s face become dark, which Mo Sun’er immediately smiled. “Alright, alright. I’ll take back my words. You lass have nothing good except Su Tao being your Achilles’ heel and giving me a grim look whenever I speak ill about him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pursing her lips, Xiao Jingjing smiled. “Without master, I would still be that ugly duckling burying my head in books! In my heart, he is as important as my parents!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er’s lips moved, but she did not speak what she wanted in the end. After interacting with Su Tao for such a long time, she noticed that the latter had many merits. Hence, there was a reason why Xiao Jingjing was so hell-bent on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re so silly! You clearly have feelings for him, so why are you not confessing?” Mo Sun’er spurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rolling her eyes, Xiao Jingjing replied, “It’s easy saying it. Do you dare to be so wanton with your Senior Brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With her weakness jabbed, Mo Sun’er tickled Xiao Jingjing’s armpit, which the latter chuckled and retaliated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Peng walked out of the concoction room and passed by Mo Sun’er’s room, he took a glance through the door’s crack and shook his head before sighing, “Two madwomen!”</span></p>
