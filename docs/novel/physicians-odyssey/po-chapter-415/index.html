<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his dream, Su Tao was riding a stunning horse as it galloped through the field, increasing its speed before coming to a stop by the lakeside. There was someone standing in the lake fully naked. However, that figure was blurred. Su Tao couldn’t hear anything nor could he see anything when he tried to take a closer look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Getting down from his horse, Su Tao stripped his clothes and ran into the lake then started to swim. He wanted to chase after that figure. But when he felt that he was becoming tired and powerless, he could vaguely hear a woman sobbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you crying for me?” Su Tao wanted to open his eyes, but his eyelids felt heavy. No matter how he struggled, he couldn’t open his eyes. It was akin to sleep paralysis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Silly girl, what are you crying for?” He inwardly muttered before he lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he regained consciousness, it was already 6 p.m. the next day. He was sent to the VIP ward in Jianghuai Hospital. There was a deep gash on his back, which had been stitched up, so he was lying on his chest. At this moment, he felt an irony. He was a famous physician, but he never expected that there would be a day where he was treated with Western Medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that Su Tao had regained consciousness, Wang Song came over with a smile. “How are you feeling?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Wang Song being so amicable, Su Tao knew that he had changed the former’s attitude after how he treated the Brain Stem Hemorrhage patient. As a man, it would make it seem too effeminate if he still held a grudge on this matter. Hence, he smiled. “I’m feeling pretty good! The wound is recovering pretty quickly, too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Song knew that Su Tao was talking about his own condition, which he smiled. “You can just rest well and recuperate here. You’re a member of Jianghuai Hospital, and you can treat this place as your home. The nurses here will immediately tend to you if you have any requirements.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao immediately felt warmth in his heart. He could tell the sincerity in Wang Song’s words. At this moment, Su Tao felt that Jianghuai Hospital was fortunate to have a leader with such breadth of mind. Hence, he replied, “President Wang, thank you for your concern. I will remember this grace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Song’s expression loosened up before his phone rang. Taking a glance at his phone, he turned to Su Tao with a bitter smile. “I still have some things to handle, so I’ll not be hindering your rest. We’ll chat when we have time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, he immediately left the ward in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But a brief moment later, a young nurse came in. “Vice-President Su, I’m here to clean your wound and change the dressing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the nurse, she was pretty young and seemed to be in her twenties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the best hospital in Hanzhou City, every nurse here must have some family background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nurse was blessed with delicate features and was wearing a pink uniform with simple makeup that belonged to the sweet and charming category.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll have to trouble you, then!” Su Tao gently readjusted his posture to make it easier for the nurse to change his dressing and felt the intense stinging pain when he shifted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fortune-telling old man’s words were really right about bloodshed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao has read the Book of Changes in the past, so he knew a thing or two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was more like a combination of the study of probability and statistics by collating various data to analyse the possibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Su Tao made a note that if he came across that fortune teller again, he had to befriend that old man. After all, there’s no harm having a prophet around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the nurse was young, she had high standards when she took care of him. It was so much so that he didn’t feel anything, and before he knew it, she had already finished changing his dressing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nurse packed the medical apparatuses and said, “Vice-President Su, I have something that I would like to ask you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can just call me Su Tao; there’s no need to be so reserved.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to be a nurse in the TCM Department, and I wonder if you can help me?” The nurse weakly spoke her request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was briefly stunned into astonishment. “This is a VIP ward, and it has the highest treatment for nurses in the entire Jianghuai Hospital. Why would you want to transfer to the TCM Department?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when the nurse wanted to say something, she hesitated and her eyes turned red before leaving in a hurry when she heard footsteps outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that that nurse must have her difficulties, which he sighed. If her request was reasonable, then he wouldn’t mind helping her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao laid on the bed, the door opened. He saw Jiang Qinghan carrying a multi-layered tin when he directed his gaze over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She seemed to have rushed over, since she was still wearing her police uniform with dazzling stars that decorated her shoulder. She wore a police cap with all her hair stuffed into it, except for the two strands that draped by her ears. Although the navy uniform did not look that tight-fitting compared to casual clothes, she still looked heroic when she wore it with her tall structure, especially her long legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, you’re here?” Su Tao wanted to get up from the bed to greet Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was immediately stopped by her. “Don’t move! You suffered a deep gash that practically exposed your bones, and the doctor said that you have to rest for two weeks!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Su Tao recalled the sobbing he heard when he was dreaming, that should have been Jiang Qinghan. At this moment, he felt that all the suffering he went through was worth it to have such a beauty shed tears for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not that exaggerating. After all, keep in mind that I’m also a doctor. In a while, grab my medical box and apply the medicine that I made myself. It’ll help the wound heal faster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan nodded her head and explained the matter from last night, “Zhao Yongde was killed by me on the spot last night in the scuffle, and it was just as you’ve guessed; he changed his appearance whenever he’s about to commit a crime. He had a different appearance last night. After making a comparison, we found out that he’s directly involved with many tomb-raiding incidents in the country, and he has also used similar tactics to escape from prison. His real name is Ma Huiteng, a person of the Miao Ethnic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Locking his brows together, Su Tao sighed, “This is a complicated matter. I heard that he seems to be from the Witchcraft Sect, which seems to be an organisation. I’m afraid we won’t be having peace in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his words, Jiang Qinghan’s eyes turned cold. “I have zero tolerance for criminals!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed. He found this spirit of Jiang Qinghan’s to be especially captivating. Now that he looked at it, it was probably this fearless factor of her’s that filled her with righteous energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strictly speaking, Jiang Qinghan cannot be considered a perfect woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aside from her outstanding appearance, she’s neither gentle nor virtuous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she had a straightforward style and treated criminals as enemies, unlike other women who were generally pampered and shy. He realised that it was this factor that made him constantly worried about her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, it would be a significant loss to society if someone righteous like Jiang Qinghan was gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This matter involves a massive organisation, and I’m afraid that it won’t be easy for us to catch them.” Su Tao shook his head before he finally recalled something and asked, “Where’s my coat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pointing at the balcony, Jiang Qinghan replied, “It’s all covered in blood, so I washed it for you, and it’s drying outside. But due to the huge hole, I’m afraid that it has to be thrown away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that Jiang Qinghan washed it, Su Tao immediately grew anxious. “There were things in my pocket, did you take them out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I did, I have common sense. I placed them in the drawer!” Jiang Qinghan was perplexed by Su Tao’s sudden question and asked, “Is it something important?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Help me look for a piece of paper!” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan seemed to have an impression of it. She had found it in the drawer and handed it to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Su Tao cast a glance at it, he was instantly left speechless before he tore it into pieces and threw it into the trash can.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao, Jiang Qinghan asked while wearing an unusual expression, “Why did you tear it apart when you were looking for it earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I initially thought that it was important, but it turns out to be nothing significant.” Su Tao explained with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao wasn’t willing to explain much, Jiang Qinghan did not force an answer out of him, but opened the tin and took out the rice, pork rib soup, and a few light dishes she made with a smile plastered on her lips. “Here, this is the second time that you’ve saved my life. So to thank you, I will be feeding you personally, and you can just remain in your current position.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao ate, he was pondering about the words written in the note, Yang Guo and the Dragon Maiden. A wry smile rose on his lips. The old man was truly godly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two characters were from a classic called the Return of the Condor Heroes, where the Dragon Maiden was Yan Guo’s master. The two of them experienced a touching relationship that went against everyone’s wishes, just to be together. Wasn’t that the same as his relationship with Jiang Qinghan as well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was a pity that his feelings were one-sided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shredded it into pieces because he did not want to let Jiang Qinghan see it. After all, wouldn’t she keep a distance from him if she saw it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao finished the meal, Jiang Qinghan packed the containers and said, “I’ll be sending you three meals a day, and I will also wash your clothes for you as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you; you’re so good to me!” Su Tao said as he looked at Jiang Qinghan’s silhouette.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you so polite? I’m your master, and as the saying goes; a teacher for one day, a father forever. So it is natural for me to take care of you.” Jiang Qinghan responded. But after a brief pondering, she was a woman, so how can she become Su Tao’s ‘father’?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, then to repay you, I’ll take care of you when you become old!” Su Tao spoke with complicated feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who needs you to take care of them!” Jiang Qinghan felt that there were two meanings to Su Tao’s words. Although the latter was young, he’s still a man. So how could she rely on a man with no blood relationship to take care of her? Thus, she rolled her eyes. “I’ll get your medicine for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After watching Jiang Qinghan leave, Su Tao instantly felt empty in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After waiting for some time, Jiang Qinghan returned with his medical box and took the initiative to apply medicine for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After briefly pondering, Su Tao did not have any reason to refuse her goodwill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does it hurt?” Jiang Qinghan stuck cotton in the medicine before she gently applied it on the wound. She feared that she might cause pain to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nope! On the contrary, it feels comfortable!” Su Tao spoke the truth as all the haziness disappeared when Jiang Qinghan was the one applying medicine for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he instantly figured something out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, life was not a drama, so the future with Jiang Qinghan was still in his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secondly, the current age was different. Love was something that exceeded the boundary of age, status, height, and otherworldly prejudices. After all, even a scientist in his eighties could marry his own granddaughter as his wife, so what’s impossible?</span></p>
