 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing seems to have planned her time well as she arrived after Jiang Qinghan left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment she entered, she gently shut the door and even locked it before she pulled the curtains and quietly sat beside Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there anything wrong?” Su Tao asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rolling her eyes, Yan Jing sourly replied, “There will be something wrong if there’s nothing wrong! You’re already in this state, so how can I possibly feel good?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Adjusting his posture, Su Tao propped himself so that he could get a better look at Yan Jing’s face while lying on the bed before he exclaimed from shock, “You cried?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glaring at him, Yan Jing denied, “How is that possible? I’ve always been cold-blooded, and my tear glands have already dried up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“See, I’m still alive, and it’s just a superficial wound that will recover after a week.” Su Tao gave a brief ponder, and knew that Yan Jing was making a cold remark since she must have been apprehensive about his injury. Hence, he smiled. “But thinking about it again, you can consider this to be something good instead. At least I can see how important I am in your heart, doesn’t that call for a celebration?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing’s face blushed from frustration and bashfulness at the same time as she snapped, “Are you still thinking about that matter? How can you celebrate when you’re already in this state?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Yan Jing with lust, Su Tao smiled while recalling a plot in a movie as he said, “Actually, I’m in a good posture. You only have to make a hole under me, and you can go under the bed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re insane!” Yan Jing glared at Su Tao. “Seeing that you can still spout nonsense, my mood has gotten better. Oh, right, haven’t you been meeting Jiang Qinghan quite frequently?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Su Tao’s heart clenched as he smiled. “What’s wrong? Jiang Qinghan is my master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sourly rolling her eyes, Yan Jing sighed, “You’ve encountered danger because of interacting with her. You took a bullet because of her previously, and now, you suffered a deep gash to your back. I have no idea where you will be wounded next. Putting it in a nutshell, I think that being together with her just brings you trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That was all purely coincidence. After all, we need to have different experiences in life to make it more interesting.” Su Tao bitterly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Examining Su Tao’s expression, Yan Jing suddenly asked, “You wouldn’t have fallen for her, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao furrowed his brows before he immediately explained, “That’s nonsense. I’m someone who likes to poke my nose into other people’s matters, and she’s a police officer that I came upon. For someone with a strong sense of chivalry like me, how can I possibly sit still and watch?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Childish!” How could Yan Jing not tell Su Tao’s thoughts, so she continued, “I’ve seen it clearly now. Although you’re young, you’re unlike those around your age.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean?” Su Tao’s interest was piqued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have a thing for older ladies, like a young married woman, or a young widow.” Yan Jing chuckled as she commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words instantly left Su Tao stunned. But pondering about Yan Jing’s words, she was right, since he did have a thing for older women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still tried to conceal it and replied, “I think it’s just your misconception.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Yan Jing analysed, “I’m afraid that it’s also related to your mental age. Although you’re in your early twenties, you’re at least in the forties for your mental age. So you’re not attracted to women who aren’t mature.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected that you'd research so much into me!” Su Tao smiled. “Are you thinking of ways to get on my good side?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rolling her eyes as she glared at Su Tao, Yan Jing reminded, “Try to distance yourself from Jiang Qinghan as much as possible. Although I’m filled with admiration for that woman, she’s more unyielding than I’ve expected. I’m worried that you might fail to get what you want and land yourself into trouble instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed. What Yan Jing said did make sense, which she had seen through his thoughts well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But honestly, those who were familiar with Su Tao just had to pay more attention to his words and actions to figure it out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it wasn’t for special feelings, how could he put himself in danger to protect Jiang Qinghan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing was an intelligent woman, and her woman’s intuition was also powerful. For such a universal lover like Su Tao, it was unavoidable for him to be captivated by Jiang Qinghan and put himself in danger for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As someone with rich experience in life, Yan Jing had seen through life. Although she wouldn’t force Su Tao to be faithful to one, she couldn’t allow him to be stubborn. It was akin to be getting up from where you constantly fall at the same spot without benefiting from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting it in a nutshell, Yan Jing wouldn’t mind Su Tao pursuing Jiang Qinghan, but Su Tao must be able to achieve it and not just waste his effort and time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, Yan Jing was prepared to accompany Su Tao for the night. Still, Su Tao insisted that it was just a superficial wound and there was nothing to worry about, so he persuaded her to return to Hua Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Su Tao being so insistent, Yan Jing gave in and promised to visit tomorrow at the same time. When she turned around and closed the door, she took a deep look at Su Tao, who was lying on the bed and helplessly shook her head.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The effect of Su Tao’s medicine was evident as the pain was alleviated after a few hours, replaced with a numbing sensation, so he tried to walk around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The logic was the same as walking around after surgery as appropriate exercise can improve the blood circulation in the body to heal the wound faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Opening the door, Su Tao took a few steps into the hallway, when he heard sobbing sounds nearby. Following the source of the noise, Su Tao opened the door to the safe passage and saw the nurse who changed his dressing earlier today burrowing her head in her knees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao coughed, the nurse was startled and she immediately raised her head and looked at Su Tao in shock. “Vice-President Su, why have you come out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The effect of your dressing is pretty good, and I feel that I can start walking already. But I never expected to discover someone crying in the middle of the night, which I mistook for a ghost experience. Well, I never expected to see you here!” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nurse quickly wiped her tears in a panic and replied, “Vice-President Su, I’m sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He Xiaoyu, why do you want to become a nurse in the TCM Department?” Su Tao knew that there must be a reason behind her crying in the middle of the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The nurse was briefly stunned, before she soon figured out that Su Tao must have gotten her name from the nurse on duty. Thus, she explained, “Because I’m currently in a difficult position. Someone is blackmailing me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blackmailing you?” Su Tao locked his brows together as his heart sunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not a local from Hanzhou City. When I graduated, I became a nurse in Jianghuai Hospital because of my outstanding grades, which I was extremely grateful and I’m fond of my life here. But when you were in the hospital, a leader of the hospital came to look for me, requesting me to… and he will fire me if I refuse!” He Xiaoyu nervously said before she continued with her explanation, “I’m not willing to do harm to others, but at the same time, I also want to remain in the hospital. So if I can be transferred to the TCM Department, I will be in the department that you’re responsible for, and I won’t be threatened by him anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao let out a sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So that was the reason why He Xiaoyu was so hesitant in her speech earlier.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;But he’s only a nominal Vice-President in Jianghuai Hospital. Despite having some authority in the TCM Department, nurses were under a completely different department, and it wouldn’t be easy for him to transfer staff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re a good child, and I’m grateful that you can speak the truth to me. May I know who that leader is who’s blackmailing you?” Su Tao nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Xiaoyu inwardly struggled for a long time before she gnashed her teeth. “It’s… Vice-President Qin Ming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So it turned out to be Qin Ming, which Su Tao had already guessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the previous Brain Stem Hemorrhage incident, Qin Ming has greatly suffered, and it was reasonable that he would try to take revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Qin Ming was dealt with by Wang Song, he still had influence in the hospital. With his power and background in the Jianghuai Hospital, it’s easy for him to terrify and threaten a young nurse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Qin Ming was too underhanded by dragging an innocent nurse into this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Vice-President Su, I come from an ordinary family, and my parents have suffered to bring me up. So I can’t let them down, and I can’t lose my job.” He Xiaoyu sobbed as her nose became sour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, what did he ask you to do to me?” Su Tao asked in a weighty voice. He was even more furious after finding out that He Xiaoyu did not come from a good family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Su Tao uses tricks, he used them against the vile, and he never used them to bully the weak, and bullying the weak by using tricks crossed his bottom line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He…” He Xiaoyu hesitated, but she ultimately gnashed her teeth and answered, “He wants me to seduce you and form a relationship with you before accusing you of rape and ruin your reputation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was briefly stunned before he coldly said, “That Qin Ming is too despicable! Luckily you did not fall for it. Although my reputation might be ruined, the hospital would only go through with a procedure and ultimately sacrifice you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His analysis made sense due to Wang Hong’s current attitude towards him. Even if he had made a small mistake, Wang Hong would take the appropriate measures to keep him around. But that’s not the same for He Xiaoyu, she might have become the victim here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Xiaoyu was ultimately still a young lady, so how could she know the danger of the workplace? Not to mention about resolving this matter. Hence, she could only sob as she begged, “Vice-President Su, you must help me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao replied, “I was the cause of this matter, so I will surely resolve it for you. As for you, stop crying. When you’re on duty, you have to be professional.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, I won’t cry anymore!” He Xiaoyu’s mood instantly became better after seeing that Su Tao was willing to help her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao returned to his ward, his mood sank. He initially did not have many thoughts about the Jianghuai Hospital and wanted to become a professional idol here. But he never expected that someone would be knocking on his door with trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the saying goes, where there are people, there are politics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Qin Ming’s scheme to frame him, it didn’t seem appropriate for him to bring it up to Wang Hong just by relying on He Xiaoyu’s words alone. After all, there weren’t any pieces of evidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering for a long time, Su Tao gave a call to Xia Yu and explained to the latter about this matter. After all, there’s no need for him to go easy on Qin Ming, he’s never been the soft-hearted type of person.</span></p>
