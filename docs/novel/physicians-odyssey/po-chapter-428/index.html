 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Someone’s stalking you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You wouldn’t be having an intention about me, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dream on!”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s always a reason. I’m a decent person, and I can’t be that casual!” Su Tao thoughtfully said as he continued, “You’ve seen many dramas, right? There are always those who pretended to be a couple or even as husband and wife, which they ultimately became a real couple, so I have to think this through. After all, this is a huge matter with my principle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan madly rolled her eyes as she sighed and swore with her right hand raised, “Don’t worry, I won’t fall for you, because you’re a huge gap away from my ideal half. I’m forced to ask you to pretend to be my boyfriend, and I only need you to do it once. After that, we will have nothing to do with each other. If you think that it’s suffering, I’m willing to pay you and hire you for your service, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was instantly left speechless as he asked, “What kind of person is your ideal half?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I like mature men, and putting it in a nutshell, those older ones. Those with charm, thoughts, gentleness, and knows a woman. As for you? You’re far from it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You and I only got to know each other for a day, so how do you know that I’m not a mature person?” Su Tao speechlessly sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m someone who rates a person by their appearance, which your appearance that looks like a little kid doesn’t pique my interest.” Gu Rushan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was triggered by Gu Rushan. Even if he knew that she was exaggerating when she mocked him, he still felt his self-esteem being injured. “Alright, I’ll promise you that I can be your boyfriend! But the prerequisite is that you have to let me touch you twice!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Touch me twice?” Gu Rushan’s face blushed as she replied, “I’ve really underestimated you. Not only are you a little kid, but you’re also a lecher!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, are you letting me touch you?” Su Tao pretended to be on the verge of leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then… I’ll let you touch twice!” Gu Rushan gnashed her teeth as she made the decision. She couldn’t afford to lose this opportunity, and if worse comes to worst, she would just treat it as if a mosquito bit her. “Where do you want to touch? But I have to make things clear; you’re not allowed to touch any special location!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking towards Gu Rushan, Su Tao suddenly carried her and he flipped her around, laying her down on the couch before he started to massage her waist using the Bianque Hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was shocked by Su Tao’s sudden actions, but when she saw Su Tao pouring ointment on his hands, she realised that he was trying to massage her injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t!” But before Gu Rushan could stop him, Su Tao had already dragged her pajamas down and she could only bashfully bury her face into the couch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was stunned for a few seconds. He knew why Gu Rushan would try to stop him. So it turned out that she had applied skincare after her shower, and the sensation was a little weird. However, Su Tao hypnotised himself that she’s just a slug, and didn’t get charmed by her appearance; regardless of how soft the skin was, touching a slug wasn’t pleasant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He felt a surge of heat in his nasal cavity, and he took a deep sniff since it was too exciting. If he hadn’t reacted in time, his nose would probably be bleeding like an open tap by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he tried his best to calm himself, he started massaging her waist for the medicine to be absorbed by the skin into the hairline fracture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the slug seemed to be slow in her response as her body instantly tensed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Gu Rushan was dumbfounded. Although she knew that Su Tao had seen many things, she wasn’t in the position to react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, she had agreed to Su Tao’s request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secondly, her butt was really aching, and she did not have any strength to resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thirdly, Su Tao’s massage was comfortable and there was a cooling sensation spreading out on her injury, which meant that Su Tao’s treatment was effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But she was feeling extremely nervous at this moment, since she had no idea if Su Tao would take it too far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he really tried to violate her, how should she react?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If she resisted, there’s a possibility that her relationship with Su Tao would turn stiff, and how was she going to explain to Ni Jingqiu? At the same time, wouldn’t she be kicked out of her role in Huadu’s Green Wine?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this moment, Su Tao was focused entirely on the treatment, and he didn’t know of the turmoil going on in Gu Rushan’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Done! Try walking a few steps!” Su Tao stood up and slightly arched his body. He realised that there was a reaction at a specific location on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being a physician, he’s also an ordinary man, so it was natural for him to react to such an erotic situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gu Rushan stood up, she naturally noticed the little tent in Su Tao’s pants. She blushed and did not dare to look at Su Tao. But when she tried talking a few steps, she shockingly discovered that the pain has disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s really treated?” Gu Rushan was astonished as she looked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yep, didn’t I just tell you that I’m a doctor? Treating these kinds of injuries is nothing!” Su Tao smiled. Although he has some fame in the medical industry, it wasn’t in the same world as commoners, so it was natural that Gu Rushan wouldn’t know anything about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Su Tao only had to tell Gu Rushan that he’s the founder of the Three Flavour Cosmetics International for the latter to look at him in a new light. After all, any woman with taste would have heard a thing or two about the Beautifying Cream and Restoring Serum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it turns out that you weren’t messing around when you treated that man in the morning.” Gu Rushan subconsciously pulled the hem of her pajamas. Since Su Tao touched her intending to treat her injury, then she wouldn’t haggle about his actions earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His condition was sudden cardiac death, and he would probably be in the ICU by now if it wasn’t for me.” Su Tao explained with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was briefly stunned before she earnestly requested, “Please pretend to be my boyfriend tomorrow as it has something to do with the man you saved today. His girlfriend mistook us as a couple, and wanted to treat us to a meal to thank us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why didn’t you tell her that we’re just neighbors? Why do you want to lie to her?” Su Tao asked as he furrowed his brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Gu Rushan did not reveal the reason in the end and locked her brows together. “You’ve already touched my butt, so why are you asking so much? No matter what, you have to help me tomorrow and accompany me to a meal. Furthermore, you have to pay attention to our relationship and don’t spill the beans!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that there must be a reason for it, which he sighed. Gu Rushan was scheming a little too much. But at the same time, it was understandable since she had to be clever as a drifter here. Otherwise, how was she going to survive in the brutal world here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll help you!” Su Tao agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was the first person he got to know upon arriving in Beijing, and he admired her quite a bit. Even if she would occasionally appear to be shrewish, she’s also a clever woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao finally agreed to her request, Gu Rushan briefly pondered before she said, “We can’t reveal any flaws tomorrow, and we have to match our lines. At the same time, we need to have a basic understanding of each other.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there a need for that? Isn’t it just a meal? Worse comes to worst. I’ll just try not to speak tomorrow!” Su Tao bitterly smiled. He suddenly realised that it wasn’t an easy task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way! The meal tomorrow is significant for me, and you have to treat it seriously!” Gu Rushan forcefully said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, what do I need to understand?” Su Tao weakly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My name is Gu Rushan, and I majored in dance at Shanzhou Province’s Art and Drama Institute. My father is a university professor while my mother is a public servant. It has been five years since I came to Beijing, and I’m currently working as a dance instructor at a dance school. I like to eat durian, my favorite color is purple, my favorite actor is Chen Mingdao, and my favorite singer is Na Ying…” Gu Rushan started incessantly rambling about her information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think I really owed it to you in my previous life.” Su Tao rolled his head as he felt his head aching. How did he get himself such an exotic neighbor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, it was also due to Gu Rushan’s attractive looks, which was why Su Tao was willing to help. If she wasn’t a gorgeous woman, he wouldn’t even want to get himself involved in so much trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s where you’re wrong!” Gu Rushan smiled. “This is a transaction, and we will have nothing to do with each other after tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there a need to be so heartless?” Su Tao rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no relationship, to begin with, so how did the heartless come about?” Gu Rushan stabbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sniffing his nose, Su Tao sourly replied, “Even a fake relationship is still a relationship. I’m already so sharp-tongued, but I actually can’t beat you in a war of words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quibbling is an innate talent for women, and you can just suck it up! Now, it’s your turn!” Gu Rushan smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when Su Tao wanted to introduce himself, he saw Gu Rushan waving her hand and interrupted, “You’re twenty-five this year, and you’re from Huainan Province’s Hanzhou City. You originate from a TCM family, so your medical skills are pretty good. We got to know each other three years ago, and our relationship is between an ordinary friend and a couple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was teased by the role that Gu Rushan’s role for him as it was more or less similar to his actual situation and curiously asked, “What’s between an ordinary friend and a couple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the one chasing after me, but I’ve not agreed to date you!” Gu Rushan blushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve already seen your butt, so shouldn’t I be promoted at the very least?” Su Tao wryly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What nonsense are you talking about?” Gu Rushan glared at Su Tao with indignance. “Remember the role that I’ve assigned you, and don’t make a mistake tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she finished, she immediately sent Su Tao out, which left him a little dumbfounded. After that, the door was opened again and she placed his medical box outside then tossed a complacent gaze to Su Tao before she closed the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao returned to his apartment, Gu Rushan, who was leaning against the door, finally couldn’t hold herself back and chuckled. She had no idea where the joy came from, or perhaps it was from seeing how deflated Su Tao was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! Who asked you to take advantage of me? Even if you’re treating me, you still can’t do that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about that, Gu Rushan couldn’t help letting out a sigh and she felt at a loss. Someone took the treasure that she has protected for over twenty years.</span></p>
