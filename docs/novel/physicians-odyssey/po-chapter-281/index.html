<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buying an entire mountain in a remote region in Sichuan was unbelievable in the eyes of others. But in Su Tao’s eyes, it was a significant profit. For Physicians well-versed with herbs, this entire mountain was a treasure. Even the tiniest and unremarkable grass could be the key to saving lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After discussing it with Leng Yuan, they agreed on the price for Leng Yuan to discuss further with the town. Due to the economic situation in Baitan Town, there was practically no room for negotiation, not to mention that Su Tao had given out an irresistible price. For the mountain of 1,500 units, Su Tao offered a price of ¥200 for each unit, reaching a total price of ¥300,000 with usage rights for seven years. To an undeveloped mountain, the price was generally at ¥15 for each unit, but Su Tao had increased it by over ten times. Even Leng Yuan felt that he had significantly benefited from this deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountain was worthless to him, and it was usually offered as a freebie for investors. With Su Tao paying a high price for it, he would surely continue to invest in it. When the investment goes into Miao Village, it would slowly drive the development of the economy. Thus, it wasn’t a bad deal for the government.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing to the side, even if Liu Jianwei wasn’t good at math, he knew that Su Tao was crafty. Just a simple walk up the mountain and he had already found a fleece flower worth ¥50,000. With so many treasures on the mountain, Su Tao only had to make a few more trips, and he could earn back the ¥300,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, it might be because Su Tao was feeling a little guilty from receiving such a great benefit, he promised that he would chip in ¥1,000,000 for the roads in Miao Village, which made Leng Yuan rejoice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Getting the entire mountain of 1,500 units was just the first step in Su Tao’s plan. According to his blueprint, he intended to spread his reach with Miao Village in the center. His final goal was to obtain the entire Fushan City’s mountain range and reform them into a wild medicine garden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it sounded like a grand objective, it was also extremely tough to implement it. However, Su Tao felt that he could walk a different path in this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chains of the Three Flavour Hall were set in cities to benefit the citizens and raise the reputation of TCM, while the Mountain Herb Project was to provide wild herbs and allow those precious herbs on the verge of extinction to continue to exist. It was also indirectly protecting traditional and ancient prescriptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Su Tao might not have such majestic dreams, he had indirectly done it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those famous physicians who went into historical records were those who saved lives as a foundation. But it’s practically impossible to create a legend like Hua Tuo and Bian Que in modern society. Su Tao had chosen a pragmatic method, or to say, a business route. He wanted to craft a TCM commercial empire in his lifetime, and not just any legend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his communication with Leng Yuan, he gave a call to Lu Shimiao and told her about his progress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao never expected that Su Tao would be so swift. However, she couldn’t understand the reason behind Su Tao’s actions to invest in a remote mountain village, which Qin Meimei shared the same view as her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you’re certain about it, I will get someone to discuss it with Baitan Town tomorrow.” Although Lu Shimiao wasn’t in support of this project, she still decided to give it a try. After all, Su Tao was the one who practically built the Qihuang Charity Funds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao could feel that his allies might not be able to accept this decision of his, for the time being, but he was confident that they would be shocked by his wisdom when the initial scale of his Mountain Herbs Project formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After sending Leng Yuan, Miao Zhongtian looked at Su Tao with grateful eyes. “Physician Su, you brought hope to our Miao Village!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Su Tao gave a modest smile, “If I really obtain the mountain, then I will also be a member of Miao Village. I would have to ask Second Uncle to take good care of me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slapping himself in the chest, Miao Zhongtian guaranteed, “Don’t worry. In the future, you will be the second decision-maker in Miao Village!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through a series of events, the whole matter was a happy ending. Miao Zhongtian got his wife to prepare a few more dishes for this noble guest of theirs. In the past, Su Tao could only be considered as a guest, which had clearly been raised by now. Even the other villagers felt grateful for Su Tao upon hearing the news. Thus, they immediately brought a few well-kept alcohol and dishes over as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a warming scene. Although life in the city was exciting, it was also filled with trickeries and schemes, unlike being in a village. Su Tao felt content.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After their lunch, Shui Junzhuo had changed into a new outfit. Her trendy clothes stood out a little too much, and they weren’t suitable for her to walk around Miao Village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wore a cotton-padded jacket, long cotton trousers, covered shoes and a straw hat that made her look eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Su Tao couldn’t help taking a few more glimpses at her before asking with a smile. “Where did you find them? You look pretty down-to-earth in those.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you say that you’re going up the mountain?” Shui Junzhuo’s face blushed as she answered, “My clothes weren’t suitable for climbing mountains, so I borrowed a set of clothes from Big Sister Lihua.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his understanding of Shui Junzhuo, Su Tao knew that this woman wouldn’t change her mind after making a decision. Seeing the princess of the Shui Family insisting on climbing the mountain, he did not stop her either, but he reminded, “Don’t run around when we’re in the mountains later. Remember to closely follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thoughtfully nodding her head, Shui Junzhuo blinked her eyes, making her look especially charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mountain behind Miao Village was called Golden Chicken Mountain on the map because the shape of it looked like a chicken. However, the villagers were used to just calling it ‘mountain’. It seemed as if they were as familiar with it as if it was their garden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard from Second Uncle that Miao Village used to be a hunting village, relying on hunting for survival. However, the hunters were getting on their age, while the young people went out to work. Thus, they abandoned this tradition of theirs.” Shui Junzhuo followed Su Tao up the mountain along with a few people. Naturally, Liu Jianwei walked in the front with Xiao Jingjing following behind him. On the other hand, Su Tao and Shui Junzhuo were in the back. When Shui Junzhuo climbed the mountain, she seemed pretty excited and talked incessantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Animals are becoming scarce, and hunting is also against the law now.” Su Tao smiled as he handed the bottle of water to Shui Junzhuo. After taking a few gulps, she suddenly realised that the bottle belonged to Su Tao. Thus, her mind started to run wild and wondered if Su Tao also drinks from the opening with his mouth on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao went up the mountain for a proper business. He knew that it wouldn’t be easy to find Cloud Grass in the vast mountain, but he still wanted to try his luck. Thus, his eyes swept around like radar as he looked around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Xiao Jingjing’s sullen expression looking unhappy, Liu Jianwei teased, “What’s wrong? You’re feeling jealous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words made Xiao Jingjing blush as she glared at Liu Jianwei before puffing up and stomping off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Liu Jianwei looked like a burly chap, he was someone with meticulous thoughts. Thus, he was also sighing at Su Tao’s endless encounters with beauties, and all of them seemed to fall for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Xiao Jingjing yelled. Liu Jianwei immediately charged forth and saw Xiao Jingjing’s face pale and an azure python hissing nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shui Junzhuo saw such a huge python, she was also terrified and held onto Su Tao’s arm tightly with her chest leaning against his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t harm it.” However, Su Tao couldn’t be bothered to bask in the sensation. This python was six meters in length, and the longest snake recorded in history was only seven meters. The age of this snake was at least three to four hundred years old, and it was practically a spirit now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Su Tao’s words, Liu Jianwei took a step back. If Su Tao hadn’t told him, the sickle in his hand would have flown over. Even a 1000-year-old python spirit wouldn’t be able to take it, even with their thick leather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Su Tao stood on the spot and took out the cloud grass that Fan Lihua had given him before and tossed it towards the python. Taking a sniff of the cloud grass, the python swallowed it before swaying its head and sped off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like it’s a good snake.” Xiao Jingjing stuck her tongue out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, she was used to living in the countryside, so she wasn’t unfamiliar with pythons. Most pythons weren’t poisonous, but they relied on their bodies to strangle their prey. They didn’t require any venom to hunt for prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Su Tao’s ears were pretty sensitive, he immediately took in a breath and started to regret it. He was too rash earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick, run!” Su Tao yelled as he pulled Shui Junzhuo’s hand and ran off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Jianwei still hadn’t recovered from the sudden holler and turned his head. He instantly took in a cold breath. There was a dense amount of insects and venomous snakes of all colors following behind them. There were also toads and mountain rats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were thousands of humans standing before him, Liu Jianwei wouldn’t be intimidated. But when he saw the densely packed creatures, he felt a chill down his spine with goosebumps.</span></p>

In his heart, he was feeling both nervous and excited, since that meant that there must have been traces of cloud grass in this forest in the past.</span></p>

Forests are covered in danger, and even a rattan can be fatal. Thus, he stopped running and turned to look at Shui Junzhuo. He instantly felt a little heartache when he saw there were marks left on her face with blood from the rattan.</span></p>

This was also the reason why his first reaction was to drag Shui Junzhuo along with him. If she lost herself on the mountain, the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p>

 <p>TYPICAL CULTIVATION NOVEL PLOT! In the mountain, encounter danger, obtain a supreme cultivation skill or ingredient, becomes an OP protagonist.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>So I believe all of you are wondering what's with the python spirit.</p>
 <p>In Chinese mythology, it was believed that aside from humans, animals would evolve into spirits after reaching an age that allows them to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Actually, it's not just limited to animals, but even plants, insects etc...</p>
 <p>A classic example would be the Monkey King/Sun Wukong! You would often see 'demons' preying after the meat of the monk.</p>
 <p>Spirits are also said to have good and evil. Those good ones would generally cultivate until they rise into heaven and receive a status in the celestial palace. Those bad ones would become demons and bring harm to the world.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>PS: Sorry about it guys, was having diarrhea for the past two days and immediately returned back to work as soon as I felt a little better.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Thyaeria had diarrhea, but got better from the diarrhea and back to be Thyaeria. [Trying reading aloud]</strong></p>
