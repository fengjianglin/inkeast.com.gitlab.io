 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan has been waiting for this opportunity, which she told herself that she had to grasp this opportunity well. During the talent performance, she had chosen a dance that was filled with emotions — Tango.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Playing the music, ‘A Night in Yunhai’ with her phone, she placed her hands in the air as if she was holding onto her partner. After that, she started to dance along with the rhythm. Although she wasn’t wearing cheongsam, her curves have captivated everyone in the Yunhai atmosphere along with the rhythm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was akin to an agile swallow as she sank into her dance and imagined herself to be the most famous dancer in a nightclub at Yunhai in the nineteenth century. Ever every action of hers contained a charm with her seductive rosy lips. Her soft waist only seemed like a grasp away and her long legs blazed the imagination of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of the judges spoke a word as they were captivated in the tango.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the dance came to an end and Gu Rushan had her right foot on the ground while her left foot was stretched up from the back while she looked up as if a partner was looking back at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a highly tricky movement, and generally speaking, there should be a partner to support her balance. However, she had relied purely on her flexibility to accomplish this feat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The director locked his brows together and sighed as he gave the vice-director a helpless look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vice-director knew what the director meant. This candidate was the most suitable by far!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The script was currently held in secret, so no one knew about the plot. In the script, there’s a scene where the female spy relied on her dance in the nightclub to obtain the favor of the villain in the drama and penetrated into the enemy’s core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Gu Rushan did not wear the costume for the scene, she has flawlessly performed the director’s standards by herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Next, I will be performing my acting skills, so please give me your opinions!” Gu Rushan was satisfied with her previous performance and felt that she had successfully impressed the judges.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had surpassed her usual standards since she specialised in modern dance; she wasn’t familiar with Tango. Hence, there were several parts that she felt weren’t perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need for that!” The director smiled as he waved his hand. “You can return and wait for our news.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was stunned and subconsciously thought that she had failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Gu Rushan walked out of the interview room, the phone of the sponsor’s representative rang. When he picked it up, he was briefly stunned before he turned to the director. “Chairman Ni is here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chairman Ni was the Chairman of the sponsor, Newlight Media, and was also one of the essential sponsors in this drama. The director knew her importance, so he immediately stood up and said to the staff, “Stop the interview for the time being!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Escorted by a group of people, Ni Jingqiu entered with her heels, standing at a height of 5’7” and with her heels that were over a dozen centimeters, she was akin to a crane amongst a flock of chickens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, there’s no need to come to the audition, but since her boyfriend was warded in the hospital, she suddenly recalled a dessert store that he liked located near Film City. Hence, she personally made a trip over to buy it, which she made a trip over there as well under the reminder of her secretary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment she entered, her eyes lit up upon seeing a woman. Wasn’t this woman the one she encountered back at the park?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life was full of fate. When she called for help early in the morning, not only did she have a deep impression of Su Tao, but she also had a deep impression of Gu Rushan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But because Ni Jingqiu had an entirely different aura from when she wore her exercising clothes, Gu Rushan failed to recognise her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Ni Jingqiu went up and smiled. “Hello, do you recognise me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan, who was still feeling bitter about the failure of her audition, looked at Ni Jingqiu with a baffled gaze, and her thoughts couldn’t process well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, but I don’t seem to know you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the few judges walked out of the interview room, they were stunned by this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, they felt that Gu Rushan must have some background for Ni Jingqiu to greet her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secondly, they wondered if Gu Rushan was stupid to tell Ni Jingqiu that she didn’t know her. As long as she claimed to know the latter, she would definitely be chosen for this audition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ni Jingqiu did not feel that it was awkward. She made a surprising action by unbundling her hair before tying it into a ponytail and made a jogging gesture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, Gu Rushan’s eyes lit up and she exclaimed in shock, “So it’s you! How’s your boyfriend now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is already out of danger!” Ni Jingqiu gratefully replied as she thanked, “It’s all thanks to your boyfriend. Otherwise, my boyfriend’s situation would be unthinkable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Gu Rushan wanted to explain that Su Tao wasn’t her boyfriend, she did not feel a need after a brief pondering. After all, Ni Jingqiu was just a passerby. She had underestimated the seriousness of the latter’s boyfriend’s condition and humbly replied, “Good to hear that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Ni Jingqiu held onto Gu Rushan’s hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I initially wanted to look for the two of you tomorrow at the park, but I never expected that we’re so fated, so let me treat you to a meal. Don’t refuse my goodwill either; otherwise, I will be disappointed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was baffled by Ni Jingqiu’s sheer passion as she was dragged out of the interviewing location by the latter before she boarded a black vehicle and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden development dumbfounded the director. He turned to the sponsor’s representative and asked, “What’s going on? Chairman Ni left?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sponsor’s representative also couldn’t figure out the situation, so he bitterly smiled. “She seems to have come here to pick someone up…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, the director wore an unnoticeable smile and inwardly sighed. That interviewee from earlier was really talented in her acting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such a huge background, she actually wanted to take the interview instead of taking the shortcut; she’s simply too pretentious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the director understood that Gu Rushan was a smart woman. If she had relied on the shortcut to be chosen for the role, she might be scorned by the production team. Hence, she went through the proper procedure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was also afraid she might be eliminated due to the unspoken rules. Hence, she got Chairman Ni to come over personally and shock everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the director sighed at both Gu Rushan’s talent and ability to scheme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the outcome was great, since Gu Rushan was so much better than the candidate that the sponsor’s representative has chosen. Hence, the director made up his mind in choosing her for the role!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By satisfying the sponsor’s representative and finding his ideal actress, the director felt exceptionally high at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have found my actress, and we’ll end the interview here. Tell the other interviewees to return.” The director instructed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the brutality of the filming industry. Many people have waited the entire morning, but they were asked to leave even before they could even have a go in the interview.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan has also encountered this situation numerous times, but her luck today has gone over the roof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oppa!” The woman who looked like an internet celebrity misunderstood that she has been chosen when she heard that the actress has been selected and immediately went up and hugged the arm of her Oppa. Swaying his arm, she thanked, “Thank you. As I promised, I will make it up to you as long as I get chosen for the role.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Oppa was in a terrible mood. It wasn’t because his candidate has failed the audition, but he was worried that Ni Jingqiu might discover that he was using the interview in his own favor. Hence, he pulled out his arm in annoyance and replied, “You did not get selected.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is that possible? I just came out, and the production team announced that they had found their actress for the role.” The woman said in perplexion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man sighed, “There’s one that came after you, and she was the one who got chosen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was instantly left dumbfounded. The result was akin to receiving a slap on her face. “How can she possibly be chosen? Look at how bad her dressing is, along with her cheap purse and makeup. You can tell that she’s a nobody!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the man unhappily glanced over at the woman and replied, “Beijing is full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons. Who dares to judge a book by its cover here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman stomped her feet and softly she cursed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been sleeping with the man for the past few days, but in the end, she had gotten nothing out of it. That meant that she suffered a huge loss!</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a restaurant located in Film City that was decorated with an olden style, Gu Rushan still had no idea that she was already chosen for the role and was at a loss when Ni Jingqiu ordered a full table of food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s only two of us, and I don’t think that there’s a need for so much food, right?” Gu Rushan knew that this place was costly despite the unremarkable taste. It cost ¥300 per pax on average, not to mention that Ni Jingqiu specially selected the costly ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ni Jingqiu seriously replied, “How can I show my gratitude if I don’t get so much? If it wasn’t for your boyfriend’s timely assistance, my boyfriend would have probably died by now. Hence, I have to thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan wanted to explain that Su Tao wasn’t her boyfriend at this moment, but Ni Jingqiu has already ordered a table of food. So what would the latter think if she told her that Su Tao and her were only neighbors, and they’ve only got to know each other for a day?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she can only go on with it and replied, “It’s nothing much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how indifferent Gu Rushan was, Ni Jingqiu was touched and smiled. “I really admire you and your boyfriend’s characters. The two of you did not leave your names behind after doing a good deed, and there are not many people in the current society who can accomplish such a feat. Hence, I wish to befriend you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan felt grateful at this moment. She could figure out that Ni Jingqiu had an extraordinary status from her entrance earlier. After all, it’s good to have more friends in Beijing, especially someone with status like Ni Jingqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s my honor!” Gu Rushan replied humbly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ni Jingqiu smiled. “Those are my inner thoughts. Oh, right, call your boyfriend along when he’s free, and the four of us can get together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Gu Rushan became a little anxious as she replied, “Then, I’ll have to check with him and see when he is free!”</span></p>
