 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the usual solemn and confident officer looked extremely bewitching. Although they’re in the dark, Jiang Qinghan’s fair skin was radiating with a glow and looked incredibly gorgeous. Her voluptuous figure was bared in its entirety. She has delicate features, a slender neck, and a slim waist without any fat on her abdomen. Looking at her perfect figure, no one would believe that she’s actually a mother with a teenage daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s happening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t the first time he had seen a woman’s body, but this wasn’t the same. He held complicated feelings while looking at Jiang Qinghan’s figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a voice hollering in his mind, reminding him that Jiang Qinghan was his master, and he shouldn’t profane her. However, he was young and his blood was boiling. Despite how he tried to control his neck to turn away, he couldn’t help looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was astounded, but he knew that he couldn’t allow this situation to continue!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Biting himself on his tongue, a pain spread out to clear his mind and bellowed, “Master! Sober up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to swiftly find the cause in Jiang Qinghan’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he started to look around to search for the culprit. There must be some trick in this tomb that caused this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was so much so that even Su Tao was affected by the drug earlier and had impure thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t afraid of any poison since the tolerance in his senses was stronger than an ordinary person’s</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But to cause Jiang Qinghan to be in such a condition, it must be both powerful and odorless. Although it wasn’t sufficient to reduce him to Jiang Qinghan’s state, where he completely loses his rationale, it stimulated the hormone secretion in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything occurred swiftly, and Jiang Qinghan couldn’t hear Su Tao’s words. She pounced over with a fragrance and soft body that assaulted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Su Tao subconsciously tried to push her away, Jiang Qinghan had practiced martial arts, and her actions were agile. She grabbed onto his wrist and pulled him against her body. Su Tao could feel his wrist shattering and tried to pull his hands back. However, he never expected that Jiang Qinghan would use his force against him and dove into his embrace instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s eyes widened. He was trying his best to convince himself not to take advantage of her. She’s his master, and she was under the control of drugs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this moment, the lethality from Jiang Qinghan’s initiative was too significant, which caused Su Tao’s mind, which had just regained rationality, to lose it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just when he was about to sink into it, he noted a scarlet flicker and glanced in the direction of that light. He noticed a crimson gem that was located in the eye of the dragon painting on the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he tried his best to recall, he seemed to have seen Jiang Qinghan touch the eye of the golden dragon, so there must definitely be a problem with the crimson gem!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Su Tao wanted to get up, he felt a numbing sensation in his crotch and inwardly cursed. His master’s hand was messing around, and the feeling was indescribable through words!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Being pushed down beside a coffin by his master, who was trying to force herself upon him; it would surely be an unforgettable memory in his lifetime!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it wasn’t the time for regret. He had to think of something to wake Jiang Qinghan up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he bit his tongue with warmblood spread out before entering Jiang Qinghan’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the stench of blood covered his mouth, his mind calmed down. When the scent of blood got into Jiang Qinghan’s mouth, her throat twitched and the blood poured out of her mouth. At the same time, she shivered, and she suddenly widened her eyes with a blank look in her eyes. A moment later, it turned into panic and bashfulness as she screamed, rolling off Su Tao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was under the influence of drugs, she still had an impression of what just happened. Hence, she immediately covered her sensitive positions and hid by a corner of the coffin. Her palm burned as she wondered what she was doing earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao got up, that mouthful of blood wasn’t just an ordinary mouthful of blood, it was his blood essence. For that mouthful alone, he would have to nourish himself for three years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he tried standing up, he felt his legs wobbly. He had drained himself greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a peek, he saw Jiang Qinghan hiding behind the coffin. Only her feet were revealed and the posture left him absent-minded again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a cough, Su Tao replied, “We’re not to be blamed for what just happened!” He could only try to explain it this way. Otherwise, it would be awkward to face Jiang Qinghan next time. “We’re both children of society, and it’s just a small matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Toss my clothes over!” Jiang Qinghan grew anxious.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao even has the mood to talk about philosophy at this moment?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao acknowledged, he went to pick up Jiang Qinghan’s clothes. Not only did she thoroughly remove her clothes, but she also did it casually. However, he was also meticulous as he gathered her socks and shoes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Jiang Qinghan would occasionally glance at Su Tao with complicated feelings. She even felt the urge to dig a hole and bury herself in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things happened when she lost control over her brain and body. But recalling what just happened earlier, Jiang Qinghan’s ears turned red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She took advantage of her disciple, and in her heart, Su Tao was the same as Yan Sha. They were kids, and he’s a little brother, at best. So how could she do this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry!” Jiang Qinghan muttered. Although she knew that it wasn’t her fault, she still couldn’t help apologising to make herself feel better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know it has nothing to do with you!” Su Tao tossed the clothes to the corner of the coffin before he turned to examine the golden dragon on the wall. As he used his hand to touch around, he pulled out the crimson gem in its eye. “If I’ve speculated correctly, your state earlier should have something to do with this crimson gem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because it was too dark, Su Tao couldn’t examine it. Hence, he could only open up his medical box and place it in a wooden box.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wooden box was made with Iron Tree, and it had an excellent sealing capability. It could prevent the crimson gem’s unique composition from leaking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Su Tao’s words, the pressure Jiang Qinghan felt in her loosened up and her dynamic personality made her swiftly put on her clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not allowed to tell anyone about this!” Jiang Qinghan bit on her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What just happened?” Was Su Tao that stupid? Hence, he pretended to be dumb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Jiang Qinghan still had lingering fear in her heart and said, “Let’s leave swiftly. I can sense that there’s something unusual here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, they had to leave and join up with the other officers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan wasn’t afraid of anything supernatural, but she was fearful of any abnormalities, just like how she lost her rationale earlier and did those things to Su Tao. It was simply too embarrassing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Someone’s coming in!” Su Tao bitterly smiled as his gaze fell on the few porcelain items in the corner. It looked like those antiques weren’t fated to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that Zhang Zhen and the rest have been waiting for Su Tao and Jiang Qinghan for over an hour. Hence, they grew concerned and came up the mountain as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they followed the track that the two of them left behind, and they found the trapdoor. After a brief discussion, Zhang Zhen came with two officers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Trapdoors were also known as Tomb Pits, and it was an entrance often created by tomb raiders to enter the tombs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Relying on their numbers, Zhang Zhen started hollering around the moment they entered. Following the source of the voice, Su Tao and Jiang Qinghan went over to join up with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chief, I never expected that there would be an ancient tomb here. How did you find it?” Zhang Zhen asked with astonishment. They searched the entire mountain, and they nearly felt their legs collapsing without finding anything. However, Jiang Qinghan and Su Tao immediately found something. Hence, he started to suspect if there was an issue in his ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While sweeping a glance at Su Tao, Jiang Qinghan seemed to be still dwelling on that awkward moment from before and faintly said, “We’re arrested one person. He should know the two decreased. We also found a gun on him, so be cautious when you take him back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Jiang Qinghan’s words, everyone thought that the two of them followed the suspect into the tomb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Zhang Zhen glanced at Su Tao in admiration. He had a feeling that Su Tao discovered the entrance of the tomb, and he felt that the latter was simply too magical. Not only was he stunning in his medical skills, but he also has the skills to solve cases!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they came out of the tomb, Su Tao took two deep breaths and subconsciously licked his lips. It was an action that was noted by Jiang Qinghan and she glared at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With an awkward smile, Su Tao felt desolate in his heart. Although the previous incident brought their bodies closer together, it created a distance between their hearts instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they got down the mountain, Jiang Qinghan thought it through that everything in the tomb was a misunderstanding, and she was fortunate that Su Tao came with her. Otherwise, she might have been injured by the black silhouette, and if it was someone else at the coffin, she might not have escaped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, Su Tao helped her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had an account in her heart, and she never owed anyone a favor. But she owes Su Tao more than a favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That person has woken up. His name is Zhao Yongde; an A-list nationally-wanted fugitive!” Zhang Zhen walked over with excitement. “Eight years ago, he was involved in a dispute with the villagers when he tried to raid the tomb and used the pistol he manufactured to murder three villagers. After that, he had been living under a different name. At Shenzhen, he discovered the Song Dynasty’s porcelains from the two deceased and tricked them into bringing him to Dongyi Village. In the end, when they managed to find the antiques of the Song Dynasty, he made use of spiders to bite the two victims to death to hog everything for himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s someone who can raise spiders!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Su Tao initially thought that the spiders were from the tomb, but it turned out that Zhao Yongde raised them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A grim light flickering in his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That means that Zhao Yongde isn’t an ordinary person, and he might be related to sects that cultivates poison bugs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did Zhao Yongde admit to it?” Jiang Qinghan furrowed her brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That person seems to be insane. It’s as if he’s unafraid of anything. He made a full confession of his crimes and even declared that he would take vengeance against the two of you!” A solemn light flickered in Zhang Zhen’s eyes as he continued, “We will escort him to a special prison!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan nodded her head. Zhao Yongde fits the bill for the special prison, since he could manipulate spiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She could also tell the excitement within everyone as they solved such a complicated case in just half a day. Hence, everyone was filled with admiration for Jiang Qinghan. She really deserves her reputation as the flower of Hanzhou City’s Criminal Investigation Division, and there was no case she couldn’t solve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But only Jiang Qinghan knew in her heart that if Su Tao wasn’t here, the case might still be in a riddle. At the same time, she started to feel curious about Su Tao, about how many mysterious skills he possesses.</span></p>
