 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This trip to South Korea was more dangerous and exciting than he had imagined. Describing it with “imminent danger” wasn’t an overstatement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Sim Chang-suk’s suicide bombing attempt to having a gun pointed at him, it meant that Seoul wasn’t a place for him. Hence, Su Tao made a decision not to come back in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, there wasn’t anything keeping him here. South Korea was covered with mountains, and the houses were small. It paled in comparison to China’s vast scenery. Most of the tourists that visited South Korea were influenced by the hype or cheap cosmetic products.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one had any idea that the low-end cosmetic products were all sent towards China, leaving the best for themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was within his expectations to be chased by these men, since he had ruined the Kwon Family’s scheme, which affected an authoritative figure’s interest. Hence, it was natural for revenge to seek him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader amongst the three men wore a cold sneer.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t Su Tao good at running? So why isn’t he running now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he came to Su Tao, he instructed his subordinates to restrict him. He raised his hand, intending to award Su Tao with a slap to vent his depression. All of a sudden, a shriek resounded that disrupted his actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had used a simple grip to grab onto his arm and snatched the pistol before propping it against the leader’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader was dumbfounded, everything happened too quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, the two other men were also detained by a man, who had a robust figure and killing intent flickering in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like I’m late!” Ah Jun took the gun over from Su Tao and took a look at it. In a brief moment, he dismantled the pistol into fragments and they fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader that came after Su Tao was dumbfounded. Ah Jun revealed his own strength with that action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah Jun was too familiar with guns, which made a misconception that he had dismantled it with a swipe of his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow is definitely an elite!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you people?!” The leader asked in Korean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In response to his question, Ah Jun coldly looked at him, which sent a chill down his spine. The former did not answer his question, but brandished his blade; then the leader was knocked out. He fell on the ground like a lump of cotton.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That man was just a small fry, and in Ah Jun’s view, the other party wasn’t qualified to question him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no time to waste with them. Let’s go; there will be someone to clean up for us!” Ah Jun rushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong? Sire Cao’s illness broke out?” Su Tao managed to guess Ah Jun’s motive for coming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the personal bodyguard of Sire Shui, only the latter could instruct him to come to South Korea. According to Su Tao’s estimation, the outbreak of Sire Cao’s illness shouldn’t have happened within these last two days. Since it broke out earlier, it meant that Sire Cao’s condition was worse than he had expected. After all, he had only caught a glance of the latter from afar once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, Sire Cao suddenly fainted when he was practicing martial arts today. He’s still in critical condition.” Ah Jun wasn’t surprised by Su Tao’s accurate judgment, since he firmly believed in the latter’s medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s get moving now, then! But I need your help.” Su Tao sighed as he looked at those men and felt that they were unfortunate to encounter an elitist from China. It would be a surprise if they weren’t dealt with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please, speak your mind!” Ah Jun’s character was direct, and he did not waste any time in other unnecessary talks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I hope that you can help me send a Thai to China, his name is Bassoon. Furthermore, please protect the safety of a lady, Liu Ruochen.” Su Tao arranged the retreat route for the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No worries!” Ah Jun straightforwardly agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Bassoon instructed the two people that came with him, Su Tao sent a message over to Liu Ruochen and informed her that he had to leave Seoul early, since there was an emergency situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shortly after the message, he soon received a call from her. Hearing that Su Tao was safe, she finally felt relieved, “I never expected that we wouldn’t be able to return together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Su Tao replied, “Don’t worry about it. You will always be in my heart, no matter where you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And you expect me to believe in your words?” Liu Ruochen gave a complicated smile before she hung up the call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao let out a sigh. After being in Seoul with Liu Ruochen for a few days, that Sect Master of the Aqua Cloud Stream has left a deep memory in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Liu Ruochen appeared to be calm and gentle, she’s actually an intellectual woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Take his attempts in seducing her as an example. Despite the excellent opportunities, he did not succeed. Hence, he left a little regret, and at the same time, it also gave him an unforgettable memory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Su Tao decided to push for the cooperation with the Aqua Cloud Stream upon his return. With Mo Sui’er as a precedent, he believes that the Aqua Cloud Stream would send more people to the Three Flavour Hall. In this manner, they would be able to provide sufficient human resources for the Three Flavour Hall’s branches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Bassoon, Su Tao had plans for him at Hanzhou’s Three Flavour Hall. He has already contacted Liu Jianwei about this matter. So when he returns to Hanzhou City, he would start his plan on rescuing Nida.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah Jun had already made preparations, and their journey was unhindered from the hotel to the airport. Thus, they boarded the earliest plane for Minnan Province.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment when he stepped into the cabin, his phone rang. It was a call from Kim Jung-ho.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking out of the surgery room, Kim Jung-ho was wiping his sweat with a napkin from the nurse. “I’ve removed the tumor in the patient’s intestine, and I took forty minutes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not bad. But if I’m the one doing it, half an hour is all I need.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You mean that you’re also versed in western medicine?” Kim Jung-ho asked. But he wasn’t too surprised by this news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Know thy enemy, know thyself. Both TCM and TKM originated from Ancient Han Medicine. We just have to learn the reason for Western Medicine’s hype to innovate and make alterations so that we can prevent our ancestor’s knowledge from being lost.” Su Tao had used an unprecedented tone as he shared his mindset with Kim Jung-ho.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Kim Jung-ho smiled wryly. Su Tao’s tone had changed due to their change in their roles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They’re no longer enemies but partners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. South Korea’s Three Flavour Hall won’t embarrass you!” Kim Jung-ho declared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe in your ability. You can contact me if you need help. I believe that with our cooperation, no difficulty in the world can stump us!” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will definitely look for you in China. I want to learn your Heavenseizing Hands!” Kim Jung-ho revealed his own desire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for that, it will depend on my mood if I’m going to teach you.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His relationship with Kim Jung-ho wasn’t as complicated as expected, since the two of them were birds of a feather. Their hearts had already been connected, and there’s no longer a need for their conflict since a victor has emerged between them. In the path of pursuing the pinnacle of medicine, having a friend was better than having an enemy</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, their relationship might change in the future. After all, they had different nationalities and standpoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking towards the entrance, Kim Jung-ho looked at his signboard, and bitterly smiled. His signboard hadn’t been hung up for long, and he never expected that he would have to change it so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, his sister, Kim Jung-yeon, called over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oppa, do you know where Su Tao is at?” Kim Jung-yeon’s voice anxiously resounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He has gone back!” Kim Jung-ho sighed weakly. Su Tao’s departure would undoubtedly disappoint many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He returned?” Kim Jung-yeon locked her brows together. “Then, I have to get my Visa done and make a trip to China!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jung-yeon, don’t fool around!” Kim Jung-ho reminded, “You still have school, so why are you running over to China? Not to mention that China is chaotic, and I’m not assured about having you going alone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m already all grown up now, so you don’t have to worry!” After a brief pondering, Kim Jung-yeon smiled. “Don’t worry. I’m only going to take a look and understand Su Tao’s lifestyle. This way, I will be able to manage his fan club better. I will return after getting some information.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandfather and our parents won’t agree to it!” Kim Jung-ho was starting to feel annoyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oppa, I know you will help me. This is my wish, and I know you will support me in my decision!” Kim Jung-yeon’s tone suddenly turned pampered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t easy to travel, since the Visa would take some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho understood his younger sister. This sister of his was extremely independent, and she wouldn’t change her mind once she’s set on something. Letting out a sigh, he pondered about putting in some work into convincing her. If he failed, then he would have to inform Su Tao about it and hope that the latter can take good care of his sister.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Liwandong’s apartment</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pinching her nose, Hwang Ji-yeon drank the brewed medicine. Because the medication was too bitter, her brows were locked together and she immediately tossed a sweet into her mouth. Along with the fruity flavor dissolving in her mouth, her mood turned better. “This medicine is really bitter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her television was playing the news about the competition between Su Tao and Kim Jung-ho.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It ended with Kim Jung-ho’s defeat, which made her feel terrific.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In her heart, Kim Jung-ho was a villain who was behind her scandal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were doctors, so why was there such a huge difference? The other was a heroic doctor who cured her injury for free and even resolved her scandal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, it was fulfilling that Su Tao defeated Kim Jung-ho.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After tapping on her phone, she found the photo of Su Tao that was pasted on the headlines a few days ago. As her finger gently caressed Su Tao’s face, she finally felt that her action was disgraceful and covered her face in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao… will we meet again in the future?” Hwang Ji-yeon realised that this man has already been engraved in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a place that has never been touched, which Su Tao has intruded in.</span></p>

 <p>End of the arc I guess... TIME TO SAVE THE OLD MAN THAT FAILED TO SEE MOUNT TAI!</p>
 <p>So, don't misunderstand the 'connection' between Su Tao and Kim Jung-ho. It's not on the romantic level, but it's more like a friendship level. So no, Su Tao X Kim Jung-ho isn't happening anytime soon!</p>
