<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Bassoon looked like a block of wood, he was smart. He has always suppressed his emotions, waiting for the chosen one who had the ability to resolve Master Qian’s black magic. He initially mistook the other party as a white-robed witch doctor, but he never expected that Su Tao would be from China, and was also a handsome young physician.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao got Bassoon to lie on the bed with his clothes removed. Bassoon was unfazed by the fact that Liu Ruochen was around and swiftly stripped down to his underpants. An ordinary woman might feel bashful when looking at the body of a man, but Liu Ruochen was a physician. Thus, the number of male bodies that she has seen wasn’t inferior to the number of female bodies Su Tao has seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re going to detoxify the toxin within his body?” Liu Ruochen asked in perplexion when she saw Su Tao retrieving his needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a moment ago, Bassoon was still threatening her life and even left a mark on her neck. The storyline changed too quickly, and Su Tao now wanted to remove the toxin within Bassoon’s body, which she was having difficulties keeping up with the development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah. Since he believes in me, then I naturally have to boost his confidence.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing to the side, Liu Ruochen weakly sighed. Occasionally, she would find herself unable to see through Su Tao. The latter cannot be classified as either good or bad, but every action he made was a conclusion after careful deliberations. It was just like pondering his next step when playing chess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She even suspected that it was within his plans for Bassoon to launch an assassination attempt. Otherwise, how would he have purposely sent her off?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, Liu Ruochen found herself captivated by Su Tao’s performance. His acupuncture technique was always so charming with absolute accuracy and ease. Furthermore, he even grasped the circulation of the patient’s body. Such skills required at least two decades of practice, and Su Tao was only 21 this year. Thus, that simply meant that Su Tao was a peerless talent in a thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao sank into his own world, Bassoon’s body was broken down before his eyes with all the acupoint locations. A brief moment later, he was shocked when he found the location of the toxin. The toxin that was used to control Bassoon was located in the brain, the most mysterious part of the body. If there was the slightest mistake in the treatment, the toxin would lose control, and Bassoon might be turned into a retard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thousand-year history of Southeast Asia black magic was truly fathomable, and it wasn’t something that could be resolved with simple medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao was more confident, since he already had a previous experience while treating Park Joong-sun and Choi Beom-gyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His needles were akin to drizzling rain as they were inserted into Bassoon’s face. Every single needle would contain pure Qi to nourish the latter’s body. As the patient, Bassoon had a peculiar sensation. It was an indescribable relief as if the sky had suddenly cleared up after countless days of shrouding thunderclouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he had such a sensation was due to the toxin being gathered in his head. Despite the monthly antidotes, the toxin was still occasionally provoking the veins in his brain that caused his mind to be blurred. This was also the secret of how Master Qian could gain control of his disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting it in a nutshell, the minds of these people would be in a fragile state due to the toxin. Their will power could be easily broken through external provocation before using hypnosis to gain control of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao completed his acupuncture, he did not end the treatment but took out a red pellet from his medical box and got Bassoon to consume it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being cautious, Bassoon took the pellet. Soon after, he felt a painful sensation in his stomach, which Su Tao helped him to the bathroom. Hugging on the toilet bowl, it was a horrifying sight. Bassoon started vomiting black blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Su Tao has used acupuncture to clear up the circulation in Bassoon’s brain, the toxin wasn’t forced out. Thus, he used the red pellet, which was something that he specially concocted for black magic. It could be used to force out the corrosive toxin in the body. The effect was also positive, despite his first trial; however, the response was a little too violent. Fortunately, Bassoon had a strong constitution. If it was someone else, their body definitely wouldn’t be able to bear the potent medicinal effect. Thus, Su Tao took note in his mind to dull down the herbal proportion for the next usage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as the patient, Bassoon had no idea that he was treated as a lab rat by Su Tao. He vomited for nearly half an hour, and he even felt that he almost vomited out his organs as well. But it was nothing compared to the pain from the toxin flaring up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the blood Bassoon vomited gradually turned from black to red, Su Tao pressed on Bassoon’s Baihui Acupoint. Not only can this acupoint be used to stop vomiting, but it can also be used to relieve headaches caused by hangovers. At the same time, it could also be used to control motion sickness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reputation of the Heavenseizing Hands was fully justified. A few seconds later, Bassoon stopped vomiting and slumped beside the toilet bowl like a pile of mud clinging onto his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Bassoon in that state, Liu Ruochen was also startled before she asked, “Will he be fine?” In her heart, she was pondering if Su Tao was purposely messing with Bassoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Su Tao’s medical ethics were high, so how could he possibly stoop so low?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He was deeply poisoned, so this was the only way for the toxin in his body to be completely forced out.” Glancing at the red pellet in his hand, Su Tao weakly replied, “Then again, I was also a little surprised. I never expected that this medicine would be so potent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words instantly made Liu Ruochen realise that this was the first time Su Tao tried this medicine. Thus, she sourly chuckled, “Now that you’ve treated him, what are you planning to do to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that Liu Ruochen wasn’t aware of the matters between him and Master Qian. Thus, he explained the entire situation to her, which the latter showed a grave expression. “Bassoon can’t return. With Master Qian’s ability, he will naturally be able to tell that you’ve removed the toxin within Bassoon’s body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao decisively replied, “I can only borrow Park Joong-sun’s strength now. After all, Master Qian is the mastermind who poisoned him. Not to mention that amongst the people we know, only Park Joong-sun can fight with Master Qian!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Su Tao took out the name card that Park Joong-sun had given him and made a call using the hotel phone. In just half an hour, Park Joong-sun rushed over to the hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Bassoon lying on the bed, Park Joong-sun’s countenance became unsightly. “Master Qian is simply a demon! I will call the police now! With a witness, he won’t be able to escape the judgment of law!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Liu Ruochen quickly stopped Park Joong-sun. “Master Qian is also a guest for the International Medical Summit, just like us. If you call the police, you will only alert the opponent. Furthermore, you’re also aware that Master Qian is close to a few powers in South Korea. So if this matter blows up, it will put you in desperate straits instead of resolving the problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief shock, Park Joong-sun realised that what Liu Ruochen said made sense. Thus, he took out a cigarette and paced around the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liu Ruochen saw Su Tao keeping silent, she asked, “Do you have any ideas?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrugging his shoulders, Su Tao smiled. “We’re actually holding the advantage right now. Bassoon was Master Qian’s disciple, and his disappearance will surely send Master Qian in a panic to take action. We only have to make preparations for him to take the bait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With her brows locked together, Liu Ruochen said in concern, “Not only is Master Qian proficient in black magic, but he’s also sneaky and impossible to defend against. I’m afraid that it will be too difficult for him to show his tail.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao comforted, “Don’t worry. I have already resolved two types of black magics. We will just face whatever comes next. I believe that he can only resort to using his powers in South Korea to launch an attack against us. After all, it’s wiser and more effective than using black magic.”</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one in South Korea didn’t know about the Kwon Family. Although they didn’t stay near Myeongdong, many stores there were owned by them. The Kwon Family was the undisclosed landlord of Seoul, since the main and branch families controlled 10% of the land in Seoul. Even a colossus like SG Chaebol couldn’t shake the position of the Kwon Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kwon Woo-bin was the new generation heir of the Kwon Family. With his handsome features, he was a charming prince in the hearts of many girls. But it was a pity that he had a high scope. He still remained single, despite nearly reaching his 40s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the influence of his family, Kwon Woo-bin was a loyal believer of Buddhism. It was even more so when Master Qian from Thailand cured his illness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Kwon Family entirely planned this time for Master Qian's activities to be in South Korea for the International Medical Summit. It was so much so that Kwon Woo-bin even arranged a grand ceremony to bless the Kwon Family with good fortune for the new year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Master Qian was dressed in simple clothing. Although it was still winter, he still wore his monk robes and had many disciples surround the Buddha statue while chanting scripture to pray for blessings. With a respectful expression, Kwon Woo-bin chanted along with the disciples and felt that his mood was relaxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the ceremony ended, Master Qian slowly got up and looked at Kwon Woo-bin with a benevolent gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slightly bowing his body, Kwon Woo-bin pointed towards the side. Knowing what he meant, Master Qian followed Kwon Woo-bin into the hall. It was a traditional South Korean building with everything being made of wood. The height of the house wasn’t tall either, so those with robust builds even had to lower their bodies or they would bump their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Venerable Father, is there any advice for me?” Kwon Woo-bin asked in a soft voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Believer Kwon, there are still other calamities that cannot be erased, despite the ceremony that I’ve performed. We’ve known each other for years, so I will be more straightforward with you.” Master Qian wore a profound and deep expression. Believer was a title used for those faithful Buddhists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his words, Kwon Woo-bin immediately bowed. “Venerable Father, you can speak bluntly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your threat comes from the west, and there will be a great calamity in a few days, according to my speculation.” Master Qian said in a profound tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please guide me!” Kwon Woo-bin pursued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I cannot reveal the secrets of the heavens, and this is as far as I can go.” Master Qian closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kwon Woo-bin was usually mature and steady, but he grew anxious from Master Qian’s words. Thus, he could only kneel before Master Qian and incessantly kowtow. “Master, please advise me on the sake that I’ve held such a strong faith for so many years!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Kwon Woo-bin kneeling for a long time, Master Qian finally opened his eyes. “Let me introduce someone to you. Perhaps she will be able to help you avoid this calamity.”</span></p>
