 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Fangbin had arranged for someone to follow Su Tao and Shui Junzhuo to Baitan Town. When they came to the police station, everyone was already waiting there with Xuan Wangjun standing at the front. Xuan Wangjun had already received the news. He never expected that Su Tao would have such an enormous backing. And now, he had offended Su Tao for a foreigner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Handing Su Tao’s medical box over, Xuan Wangjun respectfully smiled. “Mr. Su, I’m sorry for not recognising your greatness. In the past, I was unaware of your status, which was why I made a mistake. Please forgive me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Xuan Wangjun, Su Tao now knew how this fellow managed to flourish. Even Su Tao had to sigh at Xuan Wangjun’s adaptability. Checking his medical box, Su Tao noticed that although things were in a mess, there wasn’t any loss, which made him feel relieved. If something went missing in his medical box, then he would’ve suffered a significant loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mr. Xuan, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to hear your apology if I didn’t come back smoothly, right?” Su Tao smiled as he continued, “As an official, you can watch and do nothing, but you can’t lose your morals. Just because the other party has promised to set up a medicine factory in Baitan City, you confused right with wrong and even disregarded the lives of others? I’m sorry, but I’m a petty person. So I can’t forgive you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing on the spot, Xuan Wangjun was stunned, and Su Tao had already boarded the off-road vehicle. Not long after the off-road vehicle left, a black vehicle drove into Baitan City’s government building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xuan Wangjun returned to his office from the police station, several people in uniform walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuan Wangjun, we’re from the City Internal Investigation Bureau. We suspect that you’ve made serious violations with bribes recently, so we would like you to cooperate with our investigation.” The leader of the group said as he came up and showed his warrant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Xuan Wangjun wanted to run, it felt like his legs were filled with lead and he couldn’t budge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An officer walked over and grabbed onto his neck to restrict him from running, while another cuffed him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xuan Wangjun was escorted out of the building, it had attracted many people’s attention, and most of them rejoiced in their hearts. Xuan Wangjun finally got what he deserved. Due to his selfish desires, he even affected the local government’s stability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a middle-aged man in his fifties standing on the second floor watching Xuan Wangjun being escorted out with a gratified smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing beside him, his secretary said, “Mr. Leng, Mr. Xuan probably won’t return after today. From the news that came from the county, he offended the Lin Family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Leng Yuan casually said, “Prepare a car and head to Miao Village now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The secretary was briefly stunned and instantly figured out the reason. Although Leng Yuan was suppressed by Xuan Wangjun, he wasn’t stupid. That young man who caused the arrest of Xuan Wangjun must have a gigantic background. The reason why Leng Yuan made no progress in his career was due to the lacking of the right person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A decade ago, a Daoist priest once foretold his fortune. That priest said that he would be mediocre for the first half of his life, and the change of his fate would lie on a person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Xuan Wangjun’s backing was solid, he had been enduring it, even though they were on the same level. However, he firmly held onto the words of that Daoist priest, and he finally saw a glimpse of light today.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a rocky journey, Su Tao finally returned to Miao Village. Because Shui Junzhuo was too exhausted, she fell asleep throughout the journey and unconsciously leaned her head against Su Tao’s shoulder. That made Su Tao feel a tickling sensation on his cheek from her hair. There was also a fragrance that permeated from Shui Junzhuo, but it wasn’t perfume or soap; it was her body fragrance that made Su Tao’s heart flutter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the off-road vehicle stopped, Shui Junzhuo woke up from the jolt and she subconsciously wiped her lips then bashfully lowered her head. She slept too well earlier and even drooled. Thus, she was embarrassed at this moment. But when she raised her head and saw that Su Tao wasn’t bothered about it, she felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao retrieved his mobile phone, he had sent a message to Xiao Jingjing to report his safety. At the same time, he also gave Yan Jing and Cai Yan a message, since he knew that many people were worried about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing at the entrance of the village, Xiao Jingjing waited. When Su Tao stepped out of the off-road vehicle, she immediately ran over, threw herself into Su Tao’s embrace and sobbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this scene, Shui Junzhuo felt tingling from the jealousy she felt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is my disciple, Xiao Jingjing. This is Shui Junzhuo, and she is the one who got me out.” Su Tao introduced after separating from Xiao Jingjing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling her actions, Xiao Jingjing felt that she had been too rash. Taking a step back, she blushed in shame. “Master, it’s fortunate that nothing came to you. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know what to do.” When she finished, she turned to Shui Junzhuo and gave a bow. “Thank you for saving my Master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving her hand, Shui Junzhuo forced a smile. “My family owes Su Tao a favor, and it was something that we ought to do.” Shui Junzhuo looked at Xiao Jingjing and felt that she was a beauty despite having no makeup. She also sighed in her heart, since Su Tao wasn’t lacking women around him, and at the same time, she also felt sour in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jealousy was also a taste of love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that Su Tao returned safely, Miao Zhongtian also ran over and grabbed ahold of Su Tao’s hands. “Thank goodness! I was just about to bring the villagers to protest at the town.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words made Su Tao sigh. Miao Zhongtian had underestimated the opponent. He couldn't do anything even if he went to the police station. If it wasn’t for the Shui Family seeking help from the Lin Family, he would probably still be in the third prison. Even though it had been barely a day, too many things have occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I would like to take a look at Miao Yugen!” Su Tao spoke a request that left Miao Zhongtian shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Miao Zhongtian sighed, “Sure, I’ll bring you over! Although he has regained his conscious, he’s lying at home due to his injuries.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Yugen’s villa was located on a hillside at the outer circle of the mountain. While Miao Yurong looked at his cousin, he sighed in his heart. A day ago, Miao Yugen was full of vigor, but he’s lying on the bed right now. Even his matters had gone down the drain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cousin, you were too unfortunate!” Miao Yurong gave a wry smile as he continued, “Take a good rest. I’ll visit you some other time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Miao Yugen’s lips moved, he didn’t have much strength to speak. However, he could see the disdain in the eyes of Miao Yurong, which struck a blow to his self-confidence. Although he was injured, he was mocking himself that the support he was initially fawning would turn out to be a psychopath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Miao Yugen came out and saw Liu Ye brewing medicine in the kitchen, he peeked a glance over and could see her fair skin. Instantly, he felt a fire igniting in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he let out a cough, Liu Ye turned around and squeezed out a smile. “Yurong, why are you here? Only you are willing to visit Yugen now.” When she finished, she wiped the tears off the corner of her eyes. Miao Yugen was the pillar of this household, and she had lost her support now that he collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Subconsciously scratching his neck, Miao Yurong chuckled, “I’ve followed him since young, so how could I not visit him when he’s injured? Don’t worry, let me know if you need any help. You can come looking for me anytime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Liu Ye had already stood up and took two steps back. For some reason, she felt uneasy from Miao Yurong’s gaze and knew that he probably didn’t hold any good intentions. “It’s not early now, and I still have to get a doctor to take a look at Yugen. So I’ll not be making you lunch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Miao Yurong looked at Liu Ye, he could feel the fire blazing more furiously in his heart. At this moment, he didn’t want to leave anymore and ransacked his mind for a reason to stay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Miao Yugen was bedridden, he could give a probe and see if his sister-in-law had any feelings for him. Thus, he took a step out and pinned Liu Ye on the kitchen range as he gave a kiss over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His sudden actions startled Liu Ye. Although she had a fair share of experience with men, they were all famous figures. On the other hand, Miao Yurong was nothing but trash. Hence, she immediately grew furious at his wishful thinking and roared, “Yurong, what are you doing?! Get off me and get lost now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stretching a grin on his face, Miao Yurong lowered his voice, “Sister-in-law, don’t yell. There’s still a patient in the house, and you will be a widow if he hears it and dies from the agitation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was purposely threatening Liu Ye so she would comply with his demand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Liu Ye was trying her best to struggle, she was still a woman. So how could she be stronger than Miao Yurong? She begged, “Don’t do this. My life is already bitter. Please, just let me go.”</span></p>
