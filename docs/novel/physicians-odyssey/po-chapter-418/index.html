 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu was domineering when he walked out of the room. Throughout the entire episode, Qin Ming didn’t dare to utter a word since he had been startled by Xia Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no idea if Xia Yu has taken a life, and he was worried that his life might be threatened; he was afraid of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You let him go?” Miao Xinling held onto her cheek while looking at Qin Ming in disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She never expected that this man would be so cowardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What can I do? He’s skilled, and not even three of me can defeat him.” Qin Ming helplessly glanced at Miao Xinling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re useless! It’s really disappointing that there’s a man like you in the world. You’re simply a coward!” Miao Xinling vented out all the humiliation on Qin Ming as she felt the stinging pain on her cheek and looked at the yellowish liquid that tainted the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now is not the time to be discussing this matter. I’m worried that he might expose the photos; at the time, the two of us will be doomed!” Qin Ming knew that they couldn’t fight amongst themselves at this moment, since he had to ensure that Miao Xinling was standing on the same side as him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, his phone rang. It was a call from his wife, which he toughened his heart and chose not to pick up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was filled with regret at this moment, since he had no idea how he should face his wife if the photos were exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have to think of something!” Miao Xinling also couldn’t bear the stress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming’s wife had just given birth, and she’s currently breastfeeding. It was just as Xia Yu said; it was extremely humiliating for her to seduce Qin Ming during this period. If this matter was revealed, not even her parents would be able to raise their heads high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grabbing onto his hair in stress, Qin Ming muttered, “I’ll think of something.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, Qin Ming knocked on the door to Su Tao’s ward. Su Tao had already gotten a call from Xia Yu on the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Vice-President Qin, it’s already so late. I never expected that you would come to visit me. I’m really thankful!” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite knowing that Su Tao was feigning ignorance, Qin Ming still gave a fawning smiled, “Vice-President… Su. I have to apologise to you first as I’ve committed many mistakes in the past. Please forgive me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about it. I’ve already forgotten about the Brain Stem Hemorrhage’s incident!” Su Tao indolently said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Qin Ming had rage flashing across his eyes as he said, “Su Tao, we must give ourselves some room for whatever we do in case we meet again. Speak your conditions to hand those photos over to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao continued with his act and asked, “What photos?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the rage was practically blazing in Qin Ming’s eyes as he replied, “The photos that you’ve just gotten someone to take in the hotel!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrugging his shoulders, Su Tao replied, “I’m currently gravely injured, so how could I have the mood to do that? I suggest you consider whether you’ve offended anyone in the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao refused to admit this matter, Qin Ming knew that he came for naught, so he stomped his foot. “You’re truly ruthless! Since you’re so vicious, then I won’t let you off as well! I have evidence of you and Lu Shimiao committing an affair. Although she has already left the hospital, she is currently the manager of some charity fund. If I reveal this matter to the public, I’m afraid that both of your reputations will be ruined along with the charity fund!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the threat, Su Tao’s face sank. He figured out that Qin Ming getting He Xiaoyu to seduce him was only one part of the plan, and revealing the relationship between him and Lu Shimiao should be the second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming has made his preparations well. If it wasn’t for He Xiaoyu telling him about it, Su Tao would still be in the dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What evidence can you possibly have?” Su Tao solemnly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao was finally shaken, Qin Ming confidently smiled. “Almost everyone knows about your relationship with Lu Shimiao, and I’ve also contacted her ex-husband, Qiao Bo. He said that you interfered with their marriage and broke his family up; the two of you are simply the reincarnation of Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was left speechless by Qin Ming’s mouth. He had an affinity with Lu Shimiao, but they did not plot to murder her husband.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he tried to see if Qin Ming still had any other chips and provoked, “How can Qiao Bo’s one-sided words be taken as evidence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In this society, we only need to create a scandal, and the majority will not be able to differentiate right and wrong. Trust me; if you can ruin my reputation, I can also do the same to you. Worse comes to worst; we’ll hug together and die!” Qin Ming smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao knew that Qin Ming was more cunning than he had expected. He could be unafraid of scandals, but Lu Shimiao was a woman, and a woman with her reputation ruined would be the target of scorn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright then, we’ll see who will be the last one standing!” Su Tao’s tone changed as he calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming never expected this reply from Su Tao. The latter wasn’t afraid of having his reputation ruined? Hence, he sought a confirmation, “Have you really thought about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Su Tao replied, “Firstly, my relationship with Lu Shimiao isn’t as impure as you think; secondly, Lu Shimiao divorced Qiao Bo after gathering evidence of his extramarital affairs, and last but not least, I believe that the truth will be revealed to everyone sooner or later despite the fact that society would often fail to differentiate right and wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ming felt like a fool for trying to negotiate with Su Tao. He initially wanted to use Qiao Bo as a chip to make a transaction with Su Tao, but he never expected that Su Tao didn’t even blink an eye on the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will regret it!” Qin Ming waved his hand in rage as he left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he got out of the hospital, he immediately gave a call to Qiao Bo and spoke his intentions, “Young Master Qiao, do you want to take vengeance for your father and your wife being snatched?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t want to!” Qiao Bo trembled at the thought of the demon king, Su Tao, as he refused, “I advise you to know your place and not provoke him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When we drank the other time, I’ve already taken a voice recording. I’m only notifying you that I’m going to put it online soon.” Qin Ming replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiao Bo was startled before he started cursing, “Bloody hell, Qin Ming, I considered you to be a friend and told you so much, so don’t drag me down with you! If you put it online, won’t Su Tao come looking for me?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiao Bo wasn’t as well-off as he was in the past, and his character has changed after his divorce and the death of his father. He knew that he had to work hard if he wanted to bear the entire Qiao Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the recording that Qin Ming held, that was something that happened a few months ago, when he was feeling low. Qin Ming was close to Qiao Dehao in the past, and Qiao Bo also felt that Qin Ming was trustworthy, so he badmouthed about Lu Shimiao and Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Much of what he said was exaggerated, like how he emphasised that Su Tao was the one that caused a crack in his marriage with Lu Shimiao, and how Su Tao was the third party that destroyed his family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he’s living a peaceful life, and he pales in comparison to Su Tao. He wanted to forget about the demon king and live his life well, so why would he dare to try and slander Su Tao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to worry about that; I will handle it all. No matter what happens, I will deal with it for you.” Qin Ming immediately hung the call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Qin Ming hung the call, Qiao Bo’s phone slipped from his hand and fell. In his heart, he cursed Qin Ming numerous times for dragging him down in this matter. His grudge with Su Tao has already ended, so why drag him into a sea of fire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He initially wanted to rest early today, but he was now feeling restless and uneasy. Hence, he could only immediately send a message over to Lu Shimiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he knew it wasn’t useful, he still hoped that his ex-wife could understand his nonsensical speech back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao was also caught by surprise when she received a message from Qiao Bo, in which she gave Su Tao a call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that the matter with Qin Ming has grown complicated. While he was pacifying Lu Shimiao, he brewed up a plot to let Qin Ming get an idea of how the heavens were watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was already late into the night when Qin Ming returned home. After closing the door and removing his shoes, he saw his wife sleeping on the couch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was because of him realising his conscience, but his wife has always been virtuous, and he actually committed an affair behind her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a blanket over, he covered his wife, which the latter woke up from the disruption and smiled. “You’re back from your overtime? Have you eaten? I’ve given you a few calls, and you did not pick them up. I left a portion for you, so let me heat it up for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Qin Ming smiled. “It has been hard on you. Where’s our daughter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She is already asleep, and she’s growing teeth now. When she drank milk today, she was extremely playful and bit me!” The wife’s figure still hadn’t recovered from her pregnancy, since she still had a thick waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Qin Ming hugged her from the back and whispered in her ear, “Thank you, I’m really blessed to have you in my life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong with you today? You’re weird!” The wife took a bowl of soup and gave it to Qin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how Qin Ming gulped down his food, his wife was in a good mood. She knew that her husband was so busy with work that he couldn’t accompany her and their daughter. Otherwise, who would bring food home?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as Qin Ming drank two mouthfuls, the doorbell suddenly rang. It was so late at night, so who’s visiting?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the ill omen, Qin Ming pretended to be calm as he went to open the door, where he saw two police officers standing outside and asked upon seeing Qin Ming, “Are you Qin Ming?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am. Can I help you?” Qin Ming was baffled as he looked at the two police officers. He initially thought that the mysterious man from back then would come to threaten him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please open the security door. We’re suspecting that you’re involved in a rape case!” The officer solemnly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rape?” Qin Ming felt disbelief as he smiled. “Did you guys get it wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officer shook his head and replied, “We’ve just received a report that you raped a woman in a love hotel two hours ago. We’ve already gathered sufficient evidence, so please make a trip with us. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.”</span></p>
