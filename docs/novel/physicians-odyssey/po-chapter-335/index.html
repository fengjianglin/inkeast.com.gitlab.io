 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before leaving Miao Village, Su Tao gave Lu Shimiao a call and emphasised the importance of Xu Dashan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao had a good understanding of Su Tao, and all his arrangements have gone through meticulous thoughts. Thus, she got Xu Dashan to sign a contract with the Qihuang Charity Funds as a vital member of Qihuang Charity Funds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mu Chen left Miao Village, an army troop came to Golden Chicken Mountain. They did not even bother greeting the local government and entered directly into the mountain, further declaring that they would be engaging in an outfield training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Second Uncle, Miao Zhongtian, was intelligent. He knew that it was too much of a coincidence for the army to come when Su Tao just left. So the army must be here to protect Golden Chicken Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miao Zhongtian was in a good mood. Miao Village would be fully developed in a few years, and the secret on Golden Chicken Mountain would surely be known to the public sooner or later. At that time, Miao Village would be famous, and the villagers would have an opportunity to connect with the outside world to improve their standard of living.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Miao Village’s changes in this period have also attracted the attention of others. Leng Yuan practically made a trip over every week as he saw the potential in Miao Village. If he put effort into this, he might be able to color his résumé. Although he’s already old and it wasn’t optimistic for him to be promoted further, he had a keen sense of smell. As an official for so many years, he knew when to grasp the opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah Jun, Su Tao, and Shui Junzhuo returned to Minnan Province in a rush, since Cao Dingjun’s condition was unsteady. Although the latter has regained consciousness, he showed apparent symptoms of Senile Dementia. When his mind was muddled, he wouldn’t be able even to recognise his own son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was akin to a landside the moment the illness breaks out, putting it under control wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing by the door, Cao Huaiqing paced back and forth as he rubbed his hands together, which showed his anxiety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xia Dechun came out, he helplessly shook his head at Cao Huaiqing and sighed, “Sire Cao’s illness has worsened, just like what Physician Su has predicted. If this carries on, the duration of his mind being muddled will lengthen, and in serious cases, his memories will decline and he’ll lose his ability to speak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Cao Huaiqing felt his nose sour. His father had been known as the Silver Fox or Wisdom Sack. However, he never expected that his father would suffer from such an illness, which was practically an insult to his reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his voice lowered, Cao Huaiqing asked, “You can tell me honestly. What are the chances of my father recovering?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Dechun’s complexion was unsightly as he handed the file over to Cao Huaiqing. “This is his brain CT scan. His ventricles and sulci show signs of expanding along with his cortex shrinking. His condition has already reached the mid-phase. His EEG shows slower brain waves, and the Brain Perfusion Scan also shows that there’s a decrease in both blood flow and brain cerebral oxygen metabolism.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Cao Huaiqing couldn’t understand Xia Dechun’s professional terms and waved his hand. “I only want to know the answer! Can my father recover?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not with Western Medicine! We can only resort to medication to prevent the worsening of his condition.” Xia Dechun said guiltily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it, then. We’ll try TCM if Western Medicine doesn’t work!” Cao Huaiqing had lost interest in Xia Dechun. Even if the latter was a specialist in Western Medicine, there wasn’t much he could contribute to the treatment of his father. As for those medication treatments, it was merely hilarious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a breeze blew, Cao Huaiqing sighed and unhappily continued, “Jiaojiao, why are you only here now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao was blowing the chewing gum in her mouth and replied, “Dad, am I really needed here? Grandpa has the best doctor and nurses taking care of him. As you know, I have lived a princess life since young, and there are only people serving me, not the other way around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” Cao Huaiqing was fuming in anger with his daughter and responded, “I called someone to pick you up from school yesterday, but you weren’t there. Where did you go?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dad, I am an entrepreneur!” Cao Jiaojiao continued, “I’ve told you long ago that university life doesn’t suit me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Entrepreneur? You’re just fooling around!” Cao Huaiqing waved his hand in anger and ordered, “You’re not allowed to go anywhere for the next few days and will stay in the hospital. Your grandpa dotes on you the most, and since you can’t help with his illness, then don’t go around causing trouble and making a mess.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dad, since when did I create trouble?” Cao Jiaojiao was a pampered princess. She continued, “And I’ve also reprimanded my workers for that physician earlier! Didn’t you say that he’s formidable? In my opinion, he’s just a sham!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” Cao Huaiqing was going insane from his daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they were speaking, a man and woman came, which Cao Huaiqing’s eyes lit up upon seeing them. Pointing at Cao Jiaojiao’s nose, Cao Huaiqing said, “I don’t have time to bother with you right now. You better be on your best behaviour.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the protagonist that caused trouble in the arcade, Cao Jiaojiao’s mood instantly dampened. Since young, she has never been reprimanded by her father in that manner. So now that she saw her foe, her eyes naturally turned red from the anger.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hmph, it’s fine if you’re able to treat my grandpa. Otherwise, I’ll make you suffer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao knew who Shui Junzhuo was, and the two of them had roughly heard of each other. But they’ve never met before, and hence, she did not put Shui Junzhuo in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile plastered on his face, Cao Huaiqing shook hands with Su Tao and anxiously asked, “Physician Su, have you found it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I managed to find it!” Su Tao could feel that Cao Huaiqing’s palms were covered in sweat. Thus, he gave a straightforward answer, which set the latter’s mind at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My dad is conscious, but his mind is muddled…” Cao Huaiqing instantly told Su Tao about his father’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Su Tao consoled, “Please be reassured. I will do my best to treat Sire Cao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Huaiqing has investigated Su Tao, and he knew that Sire Shui wasn’t recommending just anyone. Just a few days ago, Su Tao defeated the talented physician of South Korea, Kim Jung-ho, and he immediately flew over to Minnan Province after that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Cao Huaiqing has already placed all of his hopes onto Su Tao. Xia Dechun was an outstanding doctor, but the latter wasn’t confident in treating his father’s illness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao was walking towards the ward, he was obstructed by a lady dressed in modern fashion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jiaojiao, what are you doing?!” Cao Huaiqing locked his brows together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to tell him that there’s a grudge between us.” Cao Jiaojiao stood before Su Tao as she flicked the bird. “My friends and I opened the arcade that you created trouble in a few days ago!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And?” Su Tao knitted his brows. He didn’t like Cao Jiaojiao’s arrogant attitude. Shui Junzhuo was also from a wealthy family, so why was there such a significant difference between the two ladies?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll write it off if you manage to treat my grandpa! Otherwise, I will make sure you pay the price!” Cao Jiaojiao swiftly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blasphemy!” Cao Huaiqing was fuming in anger as he gave a slap on Cao Jiaojiao’s face. “Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dad!” Cao Jiaojiao was startled by her father’s actions. Since young, she was treated like a princess, and yet her father actually slapped her for an outsider?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a contemptuous smile, Su Tao inwardly sighed. Cao Huaiqing was putting on a show by slapping his own daughter, and at the same time, the latter was trying to pressure him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go take a look at the old man!” Su Tao no longer bothered with Cao Jiaojiao and entered the ward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding onto her face, Cao Jiaojiao was enraged as she looked at Cao Huaiqing. After that, she glared at Su Tao before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junzhuo, I’m sorry for showing you such a scene!” Cao Huaiqing smiled weakly. “I pampered her too much since young, but she never suffered any setbacks. So she has become stubborn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Huaiqing was an elder, and Shui Junzhuo couldn’t comment on anything about it. Hence, she could only console, “Jiaojiao’s character is straightforward and pure. She doesn’t know how to conceal herself, since she’s still young. Maybe she might change when she grows older. At the moment, treating Grandpa Cao is of utmost importance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re more mature, and I’ll be gratified if Jiaojiao can be half as sensible as you.” Cao Huaiqing sighed. Even if he was the pillar of the Cao Family and a significant figure in Minnan Province, everyone has emotions, and yet he couldn’t be spared from vexing matters.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao first walked into the ward and took Cao Dingjun’s pulse. The latter’s condition was more dire than he had expected, since it wasn’t controlled in time. At this moment, his condition has been deteriorating with each passing day, and it was in a complete mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Su Tao wanted to treat Cao Dingjun, he had to sort out the disarrayed Yin energy within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking out a needle, Su Tao inserted it into Cao Dingjun’s meridians, with the primary being Sishen, Benshen, Shenting, Shuigou and Fengchi Acupoints, and the secondary acupoints being the Shenmen, Houxi, Jusanli, Taixi, and Dachui Acupoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The needles were slowly inserted into Cao Dingjun’s acupoints with a brief pause in between.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, Su Tao completed his acupuncture session. A gargle suddenly resounded from Cao Dingjun’s throat as the latter slowly opened his eyes and looked around before, ultimately looking at Cao Huaiqing. “Huaiqing, what happened to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing his father regaining his clarity, Cao Huaiqing finally placed down the load in his heart. Su Tao was compelling by treating Cao Dingjun’s critical condition with a few needles.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Cao Dingjun ridiculed, “What Variant Hypochondriasis? Don’t bother hiding it from me. I know that I’m suffering from Senile Dementia!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sight, Cao Dingjun was truly blessed with wisdom when he was clear-minded.</span></p>
