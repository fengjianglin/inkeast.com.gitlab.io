 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next morning, news had already spread that Qin Ming was arrested for rape against a young nurse, in which Jianghuai Hospital immediately held a meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a democratic discussion and vote, President Wang Song decided to fire Qin Ming due to the seriousness of this matter. Furthermore, the nurse who was raped also resigned from the hospital due to personal reasons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slicing an apple, Xia Yu handed a piece over to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao did not refuse and received it. “How did you accomplish it? It’s astounding that that woman would turn around and bite Qin Ming.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Xia Yu wryly smiled. “I can only say that that woman is ruthless. I initially wanted to use the photos to threaten her into confessing to Wang Song, but I never expected that she would play such a ruthless move and report Qin Ming for rape.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was also left speechless as the turnout of this matter was even beyond his expectations and commented, “Qin Ming thought of himself as clever and that he was lucky with a woman, but he never expected that it would turn into his tribulation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu sighed, “Qin Ming did resort to underhanded means to make Miao Xinling submit for the first time. As a woman, she knew how it would affect her if this matter was revealed to the public. Hence, she might as well treat Qin Ming as a friend with benefits. But this sort of relationship isn’t stable, and it cannot go through challenges with each seeking their own benefits in the face of danger. Compared to being a mistress, Miao Xinling would rather choose to be a victim. Although her reputation would be ruined in this manner, it would also make others take pity on her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao bitterly smiled. “Miao Xinling’s schemes aren’t your ordinary depth. She has probably left a way out for herself by gathering evidence of Qin Ming violating her for the first time. After all, those pieces of evidence can prove that she was forced into a relationship with Qin Ming, and she can also use this to threaten Qin Ming one day into giving her compensation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t that woman too ruthless?” Xia Yu was briefly stunned and felt that that woman really deserved his slap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So when you fool around with a woman, you must pay attention and don’t be fooled by their appearance.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sniffing his nose, Xia Yu solemnly declared, “I only have Yuqin in my heart, and I can’t be bothered to look at other women.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao really believed Xia Yu’s words. Although Xia Yu liked to pry into other people’s privacy, he was faithful when it came to love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Di Yuqin became pregnant, she was pampered up to cloud nine by him, in which he felt blissful looking at Di Yuqin’s growing stomach. Even Su Tao never expected that from the brute-looking Xia Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qin Ming might be framed by Miao Xinling, but he deserved it.” Xia Yu felt no compassion for Qin Ming and continued, “Back then, he was close with Qiao Dehao and relied on his post to receive benefits from the pharmaceutical company. He’s cunning, and the moment Wang Song took over, he instantly changed his camp and became Wang Song’s assistant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, he handed another slice of apple over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that Xia Yu had done a thorough investigation of Qin Ming. He’s naturally not a soft-hearted person, and he would probably be in Qin Ming’s shoes by now if he didn’t make a move against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling a little awkward to be receiving apples from a man, Su Tao smiled. “You can just give me the apple, my hands are fine, and I can do it myself. Oh, right, how’s Bassoon doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu’s expression instantly turned grave upon Basson being mentioned before he answered, “Bassoon’s return this time was filled with danger. There were many people who are deadly loyal to Master Qian. Bassoon suffered multiple injuries from those people, but from the news he sent me a few days ago, the progress is going well, and he has gathered a group of Master Qian’s disciples.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao pondered for a long time before speaking his intention, “I want you to train those elites that Bassoon brings over. After all, we have many enemies, and I want to establish my own trump card with Bassoon as the core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, I knew that you weren’t a person of no particular talent when I followed you; you are someone with your own thoughts.” Xia Yu sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re wrong. We’re partners, and you’ve also surprised me as well.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them smiled as they looked at each other with their friendship rising to a new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Xia Yu and Liu Jianwei were crucial to his plan, since he cannot create an empire all by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu was wise and intellectual, while Liu Jianwei was powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With two assistants, Su Tao would be able to make progress in his own ideals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After staying for a brief while longer, Xia Yu left. He wasn’t having an easy time either managing all the intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He currently had two focuses in his work. Firstly, the information on the National Healer Candidacy, since Su Tao needed to know his opponents; secondly, he had to investigate the Medicine Deity Corporation. Although Bai Fan has been locked up, Wang Guofeng has taken over the operation and managed to put it on the right track with his influence in the TCM industry, turning over the decline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nevertheless, Xia Yu’s income was much better than in the past because the Three Flavour Cosmetics International would assign roughly 5% of the profits to assist him in establishing an intelligence network. In the coming future, his intelligence department would be serving the Three Flavour Cosmetics International.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long after he left, Su Tao felt a little bored, so he took out his phone and started to look at the photos of beauties that he saved. All of a sudden, a commotion resounded from the rear, so Su Tao turned and saw He Xiaoyu standing at the edge of the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re here to change my dressing? There’s no need for it today. I have already felt much better after I used my own medicine yesterday. If it goes as I expected, I will be able to leave tomorrow.” Su Tao felt grateful for He Xiaoyu. If it wasn’t for the latter, he still wouldn’t know about Qin Ming’s plots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Vice-President Su, I’m here to thank you!” He Xiaoyu lowered her head and said while fiddling with the corner of her shirt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Su Tao smiled. “You can come and look for me if there’s anything in the future. After all, we’re already friends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Friends?” He Xiaoyu was shocked as she raised her head to look at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah. True sentiments are seen in hard times, and we’ve already gotten through a difficult moment together and defeated the evil. So not only are we friends, but we’re also comrades!” Su Tao sincerely replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for not despising me! You’re my very first friend in Jianghuai Hospital!” He Xiaoyu smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that He Xiaoyu did not dare to look at him, Su Tao asked, “You’re so pretty, and hardworking. I’m afraid that many people are trying to pursue you, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Xiaoyu’s face blushed as she sighed in disappointment, “Many people have tried to ask me out, but I know that they’re all acting. I would rather stay at home and entertain myself with books, movies, and yoga than to go out with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You know yoga?” Su Tao was taken by surprise. Looking at He Xiaoyu’s figure now, he could tell the curves despite her loose uniform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was the President of the Yoga Club back in university.” He Xiaoyu finally showed a confident expression when she mentioned it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can’t really judge the book by its cover!” After a brief pondering, Su Tao asked, “So, do you still want to transfer to the TCM Department?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Xiaoyu was briefly stunned before she awkwardly smiled. “It has already been resolved, so there’s no need for that anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re leaving some leeway for yourself.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because I know that our hospital’s TCM Department will develop once the TCM Building is built; so, at that time, I want to transfer over as a TCM nurse.” He Xiaoyu was a little excited when she spoke of her future plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your thoughts are advanced. I promise you that I will fulfill your wish when the TCM Building is done. But to become a TCM nurse, you will have to start learning and prepare now. After all, it’s an entirely different system from what you’ve learned before.” Su Tao’s eyes lit up. Physicians usually treated their patients themselves, and they did not have their own professional nurses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Xiaoyu’s idea was appealing, and why couldn’t they try having a spot for nurses in TCM as well?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After briefly chatting with He Xiaoyu, she left since she had many things to handle in the VIP ward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling bored, Su Tao sent a message to Cai Yan to reassure her that there’s no need to worry about him since he would be able to discharge tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He soon received a reply, which Cai Yan said that there’s a small problem with the branch, and she has to stay there for two days. But since he’s fine, then she would just stay there and follow up on the matter.</span></p>

Cai Yan was competent. Right now, she has become an indispensable person in the Three Flavour Hall, and he was confident in letting her manage it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he felt that he was blissful.
