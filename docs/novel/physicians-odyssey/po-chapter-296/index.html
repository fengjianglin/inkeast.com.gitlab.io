<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who?” Kwon Woo-bin asked nervously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t reveal that to you for the time being.” As usual, Master Qian spoke in a profound tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kwon Woo-bin wasn’t someone who’s easy to control, and Master Qian knew that it was impossible to gain the former’s absolute trust by relying on words alone. Thus, he did not go into it and gave Kwon Woo-bin a foreshadowing.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Master Qian left the manor with his disciples, Kwon Woo-bin sat in his room in deep thought. The west should mean the west of South Korea, and there weren’t many families that could threaten him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days ago, there was a fluctuation in Seoul’s real estate due to the Park Family’s intervention, which cost him some loss.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could Master Qian be talking about the Park Family?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a commotion came from the door, disrupting Kwon Woo-bin’s trail of thoughts. When the door was pulled open, a black-clothed man kneeled and reported, “Young Master, something happened to Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” Kwon Woo-bin immediately bounced up from his seat and asked, “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A few minutes ago, Master started vomiting, and he’s now unconscious.” The subordinate reported in a sorrowful voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To the hospital, now!” Kwon Woo-bin roared as his heart sank. He never expected that Master Qian’s speculation would be so accurate. The latter had just left a while ago, and something already happened.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a fleet of vehicles left the Kwon Manor, a black vehicle slowly drove out of a path that was a few hundred meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Master Qian was sitting in the backseat with a bewitching lady beside him. She had excitement in her eyes as she said, “Master Qian, it’s just like you’ve foretold. The Kwon Family is in chaos now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a complicated light in his eyes, Master Qian sighed, “It’s all the will of God.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lee Jun-na looked at Master Qian, her eyes were filled with revere. “What should we do now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Getting to know Believer Kwon and joining a union with him is your ultimate belonging.” Master Qian faintly said, before he continued, “But before your marriage with him, you have to help him. It’s your responsibility and destiny to help the Kwon Family walk out of their calamity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Master Qian, Lee Jun-na grew emotional. “Venerable Father, thank you for your help. I have no idea how to express the gratitude in my heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Lee Family held great power in SG Chaebol, they lost their position due to Lee Jun-hyuk’s scheme against Park Joong-sun. If Lee Jun-na can marry Kwon Woo-bin, it would be nirvana to her. It might also be an opportunity for the Lee Family to stabilise their footing and obtain control over the SG Chaebol from the Park Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile appeared on Master Qian’s lips. “The believers of Buddha are granted eternity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With revere in her eyes, Lee Jun-na replied, “Please be reassured, Venerable Father. I will remain faithful to my death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that all his arrangements were completed, Master Qian kept his silence to retain the mysterious air around him. This was the common characteristic of Venerable Fathers, since the mysterious air around them attracted believers to worship them.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fleet of vehicles sent Kwon Woo-bin’s father to Seoul Hospital. It was the best hospital in South Korea with innumerable specialists and state-of-the-art technology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the unique identity that Kwon Woo-bin’s father held, the hospital immediately organised a team of specialists. But shockingly, Kwon Woo-bin’s father, Kwon Sang-gyu, had terminal stomach cancer. Stomach cancer was a world-class problem, not to mention that it was in the last stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outcome made Kwon Woo-bin feel disbelief as he grew anxious. Although a few assistants tried to persuade him to eat, they were all rained with curses. In the end, Kwon Woo-bin had no choice but to pay a visit to Master Qian and hope that the latter can cure his father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Venerable Father, I’m willing to pay any price as long as you can cure my father.” Kwon Woo-bin begged with sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Believer Kwon, I once told you that you cannot go against the will of God. It’s even more impossible to reverse things since it has already happened.” Master Qian sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What should I do?” Kwon Woo-bin found himself in pain. He has always maintained a strong front before outsiders, but he showed his weakest side before Master Qian, since he had treated the latter as his advisor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since the calamity has already started, it’s unavoidable. But if you work hard, you might be able to change the future.” Master Qian took out an amulet and handed it over to Kwon Woo-bin. “A fated person is waiting for you. I believe that she will be able to bring you good fortune.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Kwon Woo-bin left, Master Qian sent him out. After the former left, a few people appeared and Master Qian asked in Thai, “Where’s Lee Jun-na?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She has already been arranged to wait for Kwon Woo-bin.” A silhouette responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kwon Woo-bin is someone with mature thoughts, and the arrangement must be perfect without any flaws.” Master Qian’s hoarse voice was so cold that it made others feel a chill down their spines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Venerable Father, please be reassured. We have already given out orders numerous times, and Lee Jun-na is a smart woman who knows how to grasp the opportunity.” That person smiled before continuing, “Bassoon failed to follow your orders and went to look for that Chinese physician. We’ve still not gotten any reply from him, do we need to go look for him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need!” Master Qian replied. “Bassoon failed the test, so he is no longer qualified to become one of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silhouette knelt before Master Qian. “Venerable Father, we live for you, and we will always be your loyal shadow troop.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Kim Jung-ho treated his last patient, he walked out of the consultation room with exhaustion on his face. Even if the medical center has just opened, it soon gained popularity. It was mainly due to the fight that took place at the opening ceremony. Not only was it spreading out within the upper circle, it got on those gossiping news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, that plan of his was an inspiration he gained from Su Tao. After the latter treated Park Joong-sun, he gained great fame in South Korea. It was so much so that even his sister was infatuated with him. Naturally, Kim Jung-ho spent a significant sum on his senior. He knew that his senior was willing to do anything if he was given enough money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho gave Su Tao a call and made an appointment to have a meal near the hotel. At this moment, a woman wearing a leopard-spotted coat entered his office with a nurse following behind. That nurse wore a helpless expression as she said, “I’m sorry. I tried to stop her, but she still charged her way in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, the nurse left and Kim Jung-ho sighed, “Jun-na, is there anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jung-ho Oppa!” The guest was Lee Jun-na, the sister of Lee Jun-hyuk. She wore a smile on her face as she said, “I never expected that your medical center would be so difficult to enter. The nurse told me that I had to make an appointment to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Lee Jun-na, Kim Jung-ho knew that this woman has liked him since young. However, he did not feel the same for her and helplessly replied, “The nurse was right. I’m busy every day, so you have to make an appointment to meet with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oppa, you’re so heartless.” Lee Jun-na was heartbroken as she asked, “Must you be like this? Keeping your distance from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jun-na, you’ve misunderstood me. I have no intention to keep my distance from you, but I just want to maintain our relationship as friends.” Kim Jung-ho weakly sighed as he looked at Lee Jun-na’s indignant expression. Although he would often be narcissistic about his appearance, he would occasionally be vexed when women pestered him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Kim Jung-ho with indignance, Lee Jun-na turned around and locked the office door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing?” Kim Jung-ho questioned as he furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking over to the shutter in a catwalk, Lee Jun-na pulled the curtains before responding, “I want to have a chat with Oppa, and I believe that you will like it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you insane?” Kim Jung-ho suddenly grew a little nervous and immediately rushed towards the exit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lee Jun-na was one step ahead and blocked the door before pulling apart her collar. Her coat fell to the ground, and Kim Jung-ho was shocked to see her exposing clothing. She only wore a low-cleavage shirt and an extremely short skirt that revealed her slender thighs. Taking a step forth, Lee Jun-na stuck herself to Kim Jung-ho and hooked onto his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not insane. I just want you to see how beautiful I am!” Lee Jun-na purposely blew some wind on Kim Jung-ho’s face as she pressed herself onto him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Kim Jung-ho liked women, he was a picky person. Every woman that was involved in scandals with him had both outstanding appearances and figures. But he had to say that Lee Jun-na’s standards weren’t inferior to those girls in the past; she was charming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Kim Jung-ho took two steps back and pushed Lee Jun-na away before reprimanding, “Jun-na, calm down!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had to refuse, then he would have to show resolution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t calm down!” Lee Jun-na looked depressed when she was pushed away. “Oppa, you really don’t want me? If you don’t, I will belong to someone else!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Kim Jung-ho wasn’t a monk, but he also knew the consequences of getting involved in Lee Jun-na. Thus, he bitterly smiled. “Jun-na, you’re a good woman, but you’re not suitable for me. I know that your family has recently suffered a few setbacks, but I hope that you can stay strong and not fall. We’re friends, and I believe that you will handle things well so that our relationship won’t be awkward to the point that we can no longer be friends!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand!” Lee Jun-na pulled her clothes on and picked up the coat on the floor, then draped it over her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will regret your decision today!” Without turning around, Lee Jun-na left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at her silhouette, Kim Jung-ho sighed. He knew that Lee Jun-na had a connection with the Venerable Father from Thailand. So why would he dare to get involved with her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking to the corner of his office, Kim Jung-ho stood before the body mirror and arranged his necktie. After striking a few poses that displayed his charm, he left to meet up with Su Tao and Liu Ruochen.</span></p>
