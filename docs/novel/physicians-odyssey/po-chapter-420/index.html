<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao stood at the entrance of the train station. It was already ten when he arrived in Beijing. The capital was truly different. Even if it was getting late, the city was still lit up with lights, and he couldn’t help exclaiming at the flourishing sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had come to Beijing in low-profile this time and did not book a hotel by himself, but found an agent to rent a place to stay through the internet. It was because of the National Healer Examination, which he made up his mind to stay here for a while. After he paid the rental fees for three months along with the deposit, the agent handed the key over to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t because Su Tao was daring that he actually trusted the internet when renting a house so far away, but it was because Shui Junzhuo has helped in the process. Although he wasn’t personally there, Shui Junzhuo acted as the inspector and found a place that fitted his request, and it was close to organisations that were related to the National Healer Examination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This National Healer Examination wasn’t the same as the National Healer Grandmaster’s selection that everyone knew about. The latter was organised by some departments into choosing physicians and granting them the title of Grandmaster. Although they’re influential in the TCM industry, they did not represent the peak of the pyramid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Genuine talents have all gone through multiple tests and stood out amongst their competitors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That also included talents of Western Medicine, since they’re tasked with serving those standing on the pyramid in China or partake in international medical activities. The office was also situated in a secluded location, which not many people would pay attention to.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In ancient times, it would be comparable to the Imperial Physician Court that served the royals and powerful officials.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyone that’s a member of this organisation was extremely talented, and they could be considered as genuine National Healer Grandmasters, and this was the highest position that one could attain in the medical industry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just like how celebrities wanted to be on the New Year’s Eve program, and how chefs yearned to be the Head-Chef in a state banquet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Shui Junzhuo emphasised that he had to give her a call when he arrived so that she could come to fetch him, Su Tao did not feel the need to trouble her, so he came alone to his rented apartment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon opening the door, Su Tao suddenly heard footsteps just when he wanted to enter. Glancing over out of curiosity, he saw a gorgeous, well-dressed woman holding a red dumpling as she walked up the stairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Judging from her posture, she must have learned dancing since she was light on her feet. She also had light makeup on, and she looked calm and quiet under the dusky light. Although Beijing’s temperature was low, she did not wear much. She only wore a medium-length skirt with beige stockings. Most people were fond of black stockings, but for some reason, Su Tao preferred beige ones since they’re close to the skin color!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The building wasn’t high, so the woman did not take the lift. When she saw that the lights were turned on, she was also briefly stunned. But after seeing Su Tao, she figured that he must be a new tenant here and subconsciously nodded her head as a greeting before entering the apartment beside his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he entered, he gave Shui Junzhuo a call and smiled. “Hello, I’ve already reached my rented apartment in Beijing. Thanks for cleaning up for me, it was well done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo was briefly stunned before she bitterly smiled. “Didn’t I tell you to inform me beforehand so that I can come and fetch you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao removed his coat and hung it on the hanger, he explained, “I’m not a kid. The place might be big, but do you think I will get lost?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo smiled. “Of course not. You’re so formidable, and you even managed to survive in such a harsh environment in the mountains; why would I be afraid of you getting lost? I only wanted to perform my task as the host.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. You will have that chance! I will be staying here for some time, so don’t find me annoying if I come looking for you!” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo blushed as she replied, “You’re over-concerned!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After briefly chatting with Su Tao, Shui Junzhuo packed Su Tao’s schedule, leaving him with a bitter smile. How was he here for an examination? He’s practically here for a tour!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hanging up the call, Shui Junzhuo spun on the spot. She sat on the couch with a blissful smile on her lips.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s really here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was exhausted from the long journey and took a hot shower. When he came out of the bathroom, his doorbell rang, which he saw the woman from before looking at him and she begged, “Handsome, can you help me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To have such a beautiful woman coming over to beg him, he would be a blockhead if he refused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong?” Su Tao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My house’s switch jumped!” The gorgeous woman was vexed as she continued, “My… husband… isn’t home right now, and I have no idea how to deal with it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao felt that this woman was weird. If her husband wasn’t home, she could find the property management. Wasn’t getting a stranger that she has just met going against common sense?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Su Tao pondered that this woman might find it too troublesome and came looking for him since she knew that there was someone next door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After following her to the apartment next door, he soon found the circuit. Fearing that Su Tao might not be able to look at it closely, the woman used her phone and turned on the flashlight for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sweeping a glance at the woman, Su Tao found her to be a little seductive under the blue light that reflected on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After trying a few switches, he soon found the reason and asked, “There’s a short circuit in the kitchen, which is why the electricity cannot be turned on. Are you using any electric appliances in the kitchen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was shocked as she answered, “Yeah, I was just boiling hot water!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking over to the kitchen, Su Tao pulled out the kettle plug before trying to switch on the circuit, which things had gone as he expected ⁠— the kettle was the cause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re pretty good at this!” The woman was anxious earlier to the point that she was drenched in sweat, and her mouth was dry. Taking out a bottle of a drink from the fridge, she handed it over to Su Tao and smiled. “I’ll treat you to a drink to express my gratitude!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking over the bottle, Su Tao took a mouthful out of courtesy as he examined the apartment. Looking at the marriage photo framed on the wall, he never expected that this woman would be married at such a young age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me introduce myself. My name is Gu Rushan, and it’s nice to meet you!” The woman smiled as she continued, “I bumped into your girlfriend the other day in the lift, which I briefly talked to her and found out that she has quite a unique temperament. I initially thought that she was also staying in the apartment with you, but I never expected that you’re alone. It was a little presumptuous of me, so please forgive me for that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s just a friend of mine.” Su Tao immediately explained as he continued, “I just arrived in Beijing today, and she has been helping me with an apartment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Gu Rushan asked curiously, “Where are you from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m from Huainan Province, Hanzhou City!” Su Tao answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was briefly stunned before she clapped her hands together. “What a coincidence! My husband is also from Hanzhou City!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It looks like we’re fellow people from the same hometown.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding her head, Gu Rushan explained, “My husband is a photographer, and he often goes on business trips. I’ll get him to thank you when he comes back in a few days!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not a big deal.” Su Tao could sense Gu Rushan’s intention of sending him off, which he bade his farewell and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan waited for Su Tao to return to his apartment before she closed her door. It looked like her new neighbor was a pretty good lad, and she could seek his help in the future if she had any problems at home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao also did not overthink the incident and swiftly entered into his dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He woke up as usual early in the morning at around 5 a.m., which he washed up and changed into his exercising attire before leaving the apartment for his morning exercise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coincidentally, Gu Rushan also came out at the same time. She was in a completely new appearance compared to yesterday. Although she did not put on any makeup and appeared duller, her clothes were stylish. She wore her sports attire and tied her hair into a ponytail, looking youthful.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mhm, what a coincidence!” Gu Rushan greeted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I have a habit of exercising every day!” Su Tao retracted his gaze as he stretched his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s great, let’s do it together! I can give you directions and bring you to the nearby park as well!” Gu Rushan threw out her invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll be troubling you!” Su Tao agreed. After all, it was pleasant having a beauty accompany him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them jogged down the stairs and Su Tao gained an initial understanding of Gu Rushan. It was just as he had speculated; Gu Rushan has practiced dancing for a few years, and she worked as an instructor in a dance studio while occasionally performing based on her connections with her fellow classmates as a typical drifter in Beijing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name of her husband was Zhang Ziqing, who graduated from art, and worked as a dance instructor as well in the day and set up his stall at night by the bridge to earn quick bucks by drawing portraits for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan got to know her husband as fellow instructors, and since they were both drifters trying to accomplish something, they hit it off and eventually got married three months ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two of them ran a distance in the park, Gu Rushan gasped for breath while holding onto a tree and smiled. “Your stamina is really good, and I can’t keep up with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao responded with a smile, “Your physique is pretty good for a woman too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, they instantly heard a cry out from nearby, “Help! Help!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s face sank upon hearing it and he immediately ran in the direction of the voice.</span></p>
