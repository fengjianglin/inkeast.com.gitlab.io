 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who were pitiful must have a cause for having sunk to their lows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Su Tao’s eyes, Mo Sun’er was pitiful since she was fooled by Wang Guofeng. But at the same time, she was also hateful. If she could heed the words of others, how would she be cheated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let out a sigh. Since he has confirmed that Wang Guofeng wasn’t true about Mo Sun’er, then he couldn’t sit and watch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never considered himself to be a good person, but Mo Sun’er was now part of his family after joining the Three Flavour Hall. Even if the character of this family member wasn’t likable, he still couldn’t allow anyone to bully her. However, this matter had to be planned well. He had to at least let Mo Sun’er suffer a little so that she could have some defenses in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he went to knock on Xiao Jingjing’s door. Wearing her pajamas, Xiao Jingjing was startled when she saw Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sweeping a glance at Xiao Jingjing, Su Tao noticed that this lass has indeed grown. She was no longer that ugly duckling from before, she had turned into a white swan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, what’s wrong? It’s so late now.” Xiao Jingjing weakly asked as she lowered her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me in the room!” Su Tao smiled. “It’s not appropriate to be standing outside!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Xiao Jingjing felt that it wasn’t proper, she still invited Su Tao into the room. When Su Tao saw the lamp on the writing desk, he smiled, “This table lamp is too dark, and it will affect your sight. Your vision isn’t good to begin with! Some costs cannot be saved!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Jingjing’s face blushed before she immediately replied, “Got it, I’ll go get a better one tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao sat on the chair while Xiao Jingjing sat on the bed. When he saw her nervously fiddling with her hands, he smiled. “Don’t think in the wrong way. I’m here because of Mo Sun’er!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sun’er?” Xiao Jingjing was astonished before she glanced at Su Tao. “What’s wrong with her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s not experienced in life, and she’s still a little girl. You’re more mature than her in this manner, and you also have a close relationship with her. I hope that you can convince her to distance herself from Wang Guofeng.” Su Tao analysed and felt that it was more suitable for Xiao Jingjing to do the job.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Guofeng?” Xiao Jingjing revealed a difficult expression before she replied, “Sun’er has always considered Wang Guofeng to be her idol.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Su Tao sighed, “According to what I know, that Wang Guofeng isn’t a good person. He’s going to make use of Sun’er to plot against the Three Flavour Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Xiao Jingjing grew anxious. “Is Sun’er hidden in the dark about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao replied, “Sun’er’s impression of Wang Guofeng is still stuck in the past. She has no idea that Wang Guofeng has changed greatly. Simply putting it, you have to follow Mo Sun’er and inform me if there are any movements.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Solemnly nodding her head, Xiao Jingjing responded, “Master, don’t worry about it. I’ll handle this matter well. Actually… Sun’er is an innocent lady, and she’s just a little stubborn!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The more innocent she is, the more worrying she will be!” Su Tao helplessly said, then continued, “I just hope that Wang Guofeng won’t hurt her too deeply!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Jingjing couldn’t understand the meaning behind Su Tao’s words, before the latter had already left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Jingjing’s eyes flickered with perplexion. The reason why she became a best friend with Mo Sun’er was due to the same dream that the two of them held in their hearts. Even if the protagonist wasn’t the same, the concept was the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er had a crush on Wang Guofeng, while Xiao Jingjing feels the same for Su Tao.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the night with Zhang Ailian, Wang Guofeng woke up roughly at 5a.m. in the morning. Feeling thirsty, he wanted to get up to get a cup of water. Zhang Ailian wasn’t a deep sleeper, so she woke up as well. Just when she wanted to talk to Wang Guofeng, the latter placed a finger on her lips and gently shook his head. Zhang Ailian was startled. She knew what that meant — there was someone outside!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wang Guofeng casually put on a coat, he knitted his brows the moment he came out. “How did you get in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a chuckle, Bai Fan toyed with a small object in his hand and sighed, “Since someone can secretly come in to set up a hidden camera, is it really that surprising that I can come in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shock flickered in Wang Guofeng’s eyes as he asked, “You mean I’ve been targeted?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Bai Fan tossed the object in his hand over to Wang Guofeng and explained, “A micro-pinhole camera. It’s one that America’s FBI likes to use, the Falcon’s Eye Z series!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a cold sneer, Wang Guofeng said, “It must be Su Tao! It should be fine after removing it, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Bai Fan replied, “This camera has wireless access, and I came in an hour ago. So I believe that everything before then must have been recorded!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At Wang Guofeng’s lips trembled, he lowered his voice, “I have already been cautious, and I even used the anti-wiretapping apparatus that you gave me. However, I did not find anything. Is the apparatus that you gave me useless?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s always something better!” Bai Fan sighed. “The apparatus I gave you belongs to an eliminated version. I did not expect that the other party would be using such advanced equipment!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Smashing the Falcon’s Eye Z series on the floor, Wang Guofeng stomped on it and raged, “Damn it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrugging his shoulders, Bai Fan responded, “Su Tao is more cunning than we’ve imagined, and he’s more mature than his appearance suggests. So we’ve been confused by him and underestimated his ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng knew that Bai Fan’s new branch that was responsible for competing with the Three Flavour Hall has suffered a terrible defeat. “But, I believe that it’s not your reason for intruding into my room, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a sly smile, Bai Fan responded, “Guofeng, we’re being tied together, and I want to remind you to be serious. Don’t carry on your life of debauchery. To deal with Su Tao, I need your strength!” As he spoke, he waved his hand to greet Zhang Ailian, who was in the bedroom, before he gently closed the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he was about to say would be more secretive, and it couldn’t be known by someone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seated on his chair, Wang Guofeng crossed his legs. “Speak, what do you need from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I need the Three Flavour Cosmetics International’s formula!” Bai Fan lowered his voice with a grim flicker in his eyes. “The Three Flavour Cosmetics International is now trying to open up into the international market. Su Tao’s trip to South Korea has caused the Three Flavour Cosmetics International to become a first-rate skincare product in Southeast Asia. Although our sales are good, our profits are lacking due to the difference in price we have with the Three Flavour Cosmetics International.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can it be easily done?” Wang Guofeng opened a bottle of mineral water and took two big mouthfuls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The key lies in Mo Sun’er!” Bai Fan smiled. “This is also the reason why Rangure wanted you to get close to Mo Sun’er!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knitting his brows, Wang Guofeng deepened his voice, “Mo Sun’er is still a kid. I can’t let her do something so dangerous!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Bai Fan’s face turned cold as he knocked his finger on the desk. “Wang Guofeng, you’re the Chairman of the Medicine Deity Corporation. Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his words, Wang Guofeng also became unhappy. “I’ve said before that I’m only a nominal chairman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan impatiently interrupted Wang Guofeng and mocked, “I have now changed my intention. If you can’t resolve this problem, then I’m afraid that the Medicine Deity Corporation’s Chairman will have to change. I won’t take back all the dividends that I’ve given you earlier, but as for the Range Rover and that villa in Qiongjin City, it was purchased under the name of the Medicine Deity Corporation, so I’ll have to take it back now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you threatening me?” Wang Guofeng never expected that Bai Fan would destroy the bridge so swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not, but I just want to remind you that you need worth. Otherwise, you will only be abandoned.” Bai Fan smiled as he playfully stared at Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is merely a game!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng’s value system has changed after experiencing a luxurious life. He no longer had a backbone, so he knelt so easily with just a finger on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can only give it a try!” Wang Guofeng pondered for a long time and continued, “After all, Mo Sun’er might not be willing to be controlled by me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan smiled. “Don’t underestimate your charm! I’ve already thought out a plan for you, and you just have to follow it through. Actually, I’m not here to discuss this with you, but I’m here to inform you. Because regardless of your opinion, you have to follow my plans, no matter what.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he snapped his fingers, Luo Ran walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan instructed, “From today onwards, you are to follow beside Chairman Wang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Luo Ran promised, “Please be reassured, Senior Brother. I will definitely take good care of Wang Guofeng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, we’ll call it an end today!” Bai Fan smiled. “Chairman Wang, continue with what you were doing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Luo Ran followed Bai Fan out, he bowed in the direction of Wang Guofeng. “I will wait for you outside!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng had no expression on his face. He was still dumbfounded. It was only just a night, and his life has undergone a drastic change.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing outside the door, Bai Fan took out a stick of cigarette from his pocket and placed it in his mouth. After lighting it, he instructed, “Pay attention to Wang Guofeng! He has to follow my plans!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if he doesn’t?” Luo Ran asked as he was worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heh!” Bai Fan’s eyes flickered with viciousness as he responded, “He doesn’t have the qualifications to bargain because he knows how much I have against him. Even just releasing one could ruin both his reputation and the Wang Family!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, it’s truly a divine strategy!” Luo Ran said with admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Bai Fan revealed a wry smile that Luo Ran couldn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this entire plan, Bai Fan was just the executor, while Rangure was the mastermind. At this moment, Bai Fan started to regret it since he was no different from Wang Guofeng; he had also become a puppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he knew that if he didn’t make use of Rangure’s strength, it wouldn’t be possible for the Medicine Deity Corporation to make a breakthrough. At the same time, he would be eternally under Xu Tiande’s shadows!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although we should be firm in life most of the time, we should also grasp the opportunity well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan was confident that he was just mutually making use of Rangure. As for the final result, he had a higher chance of winning!</span></p>
