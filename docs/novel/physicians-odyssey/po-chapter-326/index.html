 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao, Shui Junzhuo, and Ah Jun did not accept the Cao Family’s warm invitation, but chose a casual restaurant that served Minnan dishes to have their meal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the old man from the Cao Family regained his consciousness, everything was in a mess, and no one had the time to bother about Su Tao and company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Minnan Province was located close to the sea, and their dishes were also related to seafood. The locals liked adding bamboo shoots in their dishes, and it was tasty, once you got used to the taste: stewed Seafood Noodles, Yam Ball, Sautéed Clam Noodles, and Crab Stewed Vermicelli. Shui Junzhuo wasn’t bashful and ate quite a bit. Although she was a glutton, she maintained an elegant bearing. With a glance, anyone could tell that she was from a prestigious family with her table manners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Su Tao was fond of light-tasting food, he could accept Minnan dishes, since they were light in taste. When he was 70% full, he placed his chopsticks down. As for Ah Jun, he was a man with a northern character. He liked meat and fish, but he couldn’t get used to the taste of seafood. Or perhaps he was trying to allow Su Tao and Shui Junzhuo to interact, since he found an excuse to smoke and returned to the military jeep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve become famous after this trip abroad!” Although it sounded like a negative connotation, her tone was actually filled with pride. When she finally filled her stomach, she took a napkin to wipe her lips. “You’ve stirred quite the turmoil in South Korea. If it’s as I’ve expected, there will be quite a few demonstrations next month. With the chaos in South Korea between the Chaebols, several important economic strategies from America has failed. So you’ve made a great contribution to the country.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected that the Chaebols in South Korea would believe in witch doctors and even go as far as performing a sacrificial ceremony.” Su Tao weakly sighed. Although he left South Korea, there were still news from the other side. Han Jung-yul bore the pressure and found quite a few pieces of evidence that pointed to a special organisation that was formed by a few elites amongst the Chaebols in South Korea. It was similar to an evil cult. Master Qian was the protector of that organisation and used his ancient black magic to protect the organisation as it developed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Kwon Family was also an essential power in that organisation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Jung-yul was just an ordinary prosecutor, so there must be someone helping him for him to dig out so much dirt. If it’s as Su Tao has expected, it must be a hidden force from China.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the economic activities between China and South Korea, human resources also got shifted often. Hence, the Chinese government has fostered quite a bit of hidden forces in South Korea, which has started to possess some power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Shui Junzhuo was nominally from a multinational organisation, her actual job scope included some important strategic countries and make arrangements for the hidden forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even France’s Silver Generation and Germany’s Iron Chariot have their own intelligence agents stationed in China.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not only in South Korea, but there were similar cases within the countries in Asia. It’s actually not those in power who believe in the supernatural power, but they’re trying to manipulate people’s hearts through faith.” Shui Junzhuo analysed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Su Tao was briefly stunned. He never expected Shui Junzhuo to have such a clear insight into the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some people might not be superstitious, but they hoped to manipulate others through faith and anyone that can achieve that were intelligent people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao smiled. “Perhaps, in the eyes of an authoritative figure, I’m just a chess piece.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking her finger, Shui Junzhuo smiled. “Strictly speaking, you’re not a chess piece.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Su Tao looked at Shui Junzhuo in perplexion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re a game-changer! No one expected for you to stand out and change the entire game in the underground exchange between the two countries.” Shui Junzhuo smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks for your compliments, but it doesn’t come with any benefits!” Su Tao commented as he flung his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If there are no benefits, what do you think I’m doing here in Minnan Province?” Shui Junzhuo winked as she smiled towards Su Tao, then she took out an envelope from her purse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Open it now?” Despite Su Tao’s words, he had already started to open up the envelope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course!” Shui Junzhuo helplessly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a document with a red header, and the first thing that appeared in his eyes was the title, ‘Letter of Commendation.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the letter, Su Tao was instantly speechless, before he sourly said, “I initially thought that there would be an actual reward, but this is just a paper!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t underestimate this paper. This paper is akin to a safe pass. With this document, you can receive the polite reception of special departments in the country.” Shui Junzhuo looked at Su Tao with a complicated gaze. She never expected that the latter would be more materialistic than she imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After carefully folding the document, Su Tao placed it into the envelope before storing it in his medical box.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite Su Tao’s words, he still kept it smartly. Shui Junzhuo’s expression loosened up, so she asked, “How’s Sire Cao’s illness? Are you confident in treating him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words made Su Tao wear a bitter smile. Whether it was Sire Shui, Ah Jun, or even Shui Junzhuo, they seemed to look at him too highly. He might have excellent medical skills, but he’s not omnipotent. Life and death were part of natural law. If he really became the enemy of Yama and could treat any illness, he would’ve ruined the balance of the world, which went against the principle of TCM, to maintain a balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sire Cao’s condition is severe. The old injury in his head has existed for decades, and it was so serious that his nerves were affected. In TCM terms, his Yin is strong, while Yang is weak. There is a surplus of a Yin toxin in his body, but it can be controlled with medicine and medical treatment. But treating him completely is practically impossible.” Su Tao spoke the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even you can’t treat him?” Shui Junzhuo was surprised by Su Tao’s explanation. “What’s the best outcome if his condition is under control?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Within three to five years, the outbreak of his Senile Dementia will be greatly reduced. Under normal conditions, he will be similar to an ordinary person. At the same time, I have to try and nurse his physique so that the outbreak will not be too frequent and complicate his condition.” Su Tao knew that Shui Junzhuo was asking him on behalf of Sire Shui, so he had to be more detailed with his explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Shui Junzhuo bitterly smiled. “Grandpa Cao has always been a tough and prideful person. Although the Variant Hypochondriasis is a lie, it is also a good excuse to retain his face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was humanity; even their illness was different from others. If Cao Dingjun knew that he was suffering from Senile Dementia, he would surely refuse treatment and deny his illness. But if it was a profound illness, he would feel prideful that even his illness was at a higher level than others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Su Tao’s meticulous thoughts, he caught onto Cao Dingjun’s mentality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Cao Dingjun’s refusal for medical attention was due to the suffering he went through for his head injury and leaving a shadow in his heart, part of it was also due to his refusal to admit that he has grown old and became vulnerable to illnesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a wry smile, Su Tao replied, “I’m also treating the illness based on his character. You need to get Sire Shui into this matter, as well. Otherwise, all my efforts will go down the drain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How are you going to treat him?” Shui Junzhuo was interested in TCM, since there was too much knowledge in it that touched on human nature. It was a study filled with philosophy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You still remember the Golden Chicken Mountain behind the Miao Village?” Su Tao asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Naturally!” Shui Junzhuo’s face blushed. Back then, when Su Tao and her were on the mountain, they encountered far too many exciting events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s a herb on the Golden Chicken Mountain that is on the verge of extinction. If I can find that herb, there will be a high chance of treating Sire Cao.” Su Tao was naturally speaking about the Cloud Grass, since it is beneficial to the organs. By matching it with a few common herbs used to treat Senile Dementia, it would have a distinct effect within two to three months.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You mean you want to go look for the Cloud Grass!” Shui Junzhuo finally understood what Su Tao was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I have to make a trip to Sichuan Province.” Talking to Shui Junzhuo was easy, since he didn’t have to waste any effort explaining. “Please inform Sire Shui and the Cao Family about it. If I fail to find the Cloud Grass, then we can only settle for the second option. I will try and use other herbs to replace it, but that means that the treatment will be lengthened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go with you!” Shui Junzhuo suggested all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at Shui Junzhuo with a complicated light, Su Tao replied, “No way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Shui Junzhuo immediately became unhappy. “Are you afraid that I will drag you down? But I went with you the other time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This time, I will be staying on the mountain for days!” Su Tao patiently tried to explain, “You’re a lady. Aren’t you afraid of your reputation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Shui Junzhuo sighed and took a step back. “Alright then, I wish you the best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life on the mountain would be monotonous and dull. So it would undoubtedly be more enjoyable with such a gorgeous woman like Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao was going to the mountain with a motive, and he was determined to find the Cloud Grass. So that meant that they would be eating, sleeping, and even doing their businesses in the mountain. So he was afraid that a princess like Shui Junzhuo would suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, when are you leaving?” Shui Junzhuo curiously asked after a brief pondering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tomorrow!” Su Tao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, Grandpa Cao’s illness cannot be delayed. Finding the Cloud Grass earlier will give better hope in treating him.” Shui Junzhuo spoke with a smile. However, she still felt reluctant in her heart, since she never expected that she would have to part with Su Tao when they just met up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Shui Junzhuo knew that she has fallen for Su Tao. However, judging from Su Tao’s attitude, his feelings for her were probably just admiration, at best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You seem upset.” Su Tao looked at Shui Junzhuo with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” Shui Junzhuo immediately swept her fringe and tried to hide her awkwardness. “Yeah, I’m a sensitive person!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Su Tao smiled. “Don’t worry. There’re still opportunities for us to meet in the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He grabbed onto Shui Junzhuo’s hand and shoved a small ring over. It was an amethyst he brought back from South Korea. The price wasn’t expensive, it only costs a few hundred. However, it was exquisite in appearance, “For you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at the lustrous violet gemstone, Shui Junzhuo was briefly stunned, since this was the first gift she has received from the opposite sex in her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding onto Shui Junzhuo’s hand, Su Tao wore the ring for her and stressed, “This ring represents our friendship, so don’t overthink it!”</span></p>
