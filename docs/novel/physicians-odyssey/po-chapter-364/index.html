 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only does beauty come from the appearance, but it also comes from the heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Lu Shimiao resigned from her job as the Paediatrics Department Head, she was living her life with more confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Avoiding the gossiping news of her colleagues, she became a worker of charity. Although she hadn’t been in this position for a long time, she has already sorted out the tasks in Qihuang Charity Funds due to her image and mature way of handling things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through the Golden Chicken Mountain project, Lu Shimiao has displayed her powerful public relation skills. In just a month, she had the contract signed, and at the same time, the roadwork for the route from the town to the village has already begun. If it goes as he had expected, they should have the village linked with the outside world by summer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other plans of the Qihuang Charity Funds, Lu Shimiao has already contacted the local government of Baihe City for the orphanage project in the hope that she could take over the orphanage that she came from. Firstly, she had feelings for that orphanage; secondly, she could garner experience by starting from something she was familiar with as a preparation for further work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Shimiao also wanted to meet with Su Tao to share her new ideas with him. In her heart, she considered herself as the executor of the Qihuang Charity Funds, while Su Tao was the core and brain of the funds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Driving her BMW, Lu Shimiao reached Mellow’s Dine. When she entered, she immediately saw Su Tao waving his hand in her direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An innocent smile spread on Little Yuan’s lips as she flung Lu Shimiao’s hand and scampered towards Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing up from his seat, Su Tao caught Little Yuan and spun her around in the air while the latter burst out with chuckles. The arc on Lu Shimiao’s lips rose further as she quickened her steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s been a long time, Little Yuan. You feel heavier now!” Su Tao looked at Little Yuan. Her skinny chin has become ampler. There were even dimples on her cheeks when she smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lowering her head, Lu Shimiao placed her finger by her lips. “Don’t say that or she won’t be willing to eat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief shock, Su Tao smiled. “She will want to lose weight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Girls, they’re always fond of beauty!” Lu Shimiao said with love as she caressed Little Yuan’s hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao smiled. “Now, I’m reassured to see you and Little Yuan doing so well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finishing his words, he waved his hand towards the attendant and they came out with the menu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Handing over the menu over to Little Yuan, she actually rejected it at first, but after Lu Shimiao whispered some words to her ears, Little Yuan smiled sweetly and flipped through the pages. In the end, she pointed at a steak, french fries, spaghetti, and dessert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you tell Little Yuan?” Su Tao was perplexed as he looked at Lu Shimiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking her head, Lu Shimiao smiled. “It’s a private conversation between a mother and daughter, how can we tell you about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boring!” Su Tao stretched his hands apart and spoke in disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Little Yuan gave Lu Shimiao a hand sign, which the latter nodded her head and said, “Alright, Little Yuan said that I could tell you our secrets. I told Little Yuan that Uncle Su likes chubbier girls because that means that they’re healthy. In this manner, she will recover faster if she accepts treatment, so she felt that she needed to eat more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao smiled. “True!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Lu Shimiao and Su Tao ordered a few more dishes. After the waiter recorded their order, they left to place the orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao’s gaze fell onto a location nearby, he briefly locked his brows together. Lu Shimiao noted this small detail, so she curiously asked, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just saw two acquaintances!” Su Tao wryly smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to head there to greet them?” Lu Shimiao asked as she analysed Su Tao’s expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I better not do that. If I go over, I’m afraid that I might disrupt their mood.” Su Tao sighed. Sometimes, one had to learn how to turn a blind eye and pretended not to know anything despite discovering some secrets.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seated not too far away, Mo Sun’er suddenly lowered her head. When Wang Guofeng saw her unusual expression, he asked with a smile, “Junior Sister, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just saw someone I don’t want to see!” Mo Sun’er was cursing in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is there so much coincidence?! Hanzhou City is so vast, and yet I actually ran into Su Tao here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng and Su Tao were competitors, and the latter wouldn’t suspect her for privately meeting up with Wang Guofeng behind his back, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Guofeng slowly turned around, he narrowed his eyes and inwardly sneered. He never expected that he would encounter Su Tao here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no need to worry. We are Senior Brother and Junior Sister. What can he do about us having a meal?” Wang Guofeng comforted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, your relationship with Su Tao isn’t good, and I’m worried that he might misunderstand me when I’m meeting with you privately…” But after a brief pondering, Mo Sun’er decided not to finish her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is he afraid of you revealing the secrets of the Three Flavour Hall?” Wang Guofeng furiously said, before he continued, “Sun’er, I know the standard of your medical skills. If the Three Flavour Hall doesn’t want you, I can recommend you somewhere better. I guarantee that you will be able to exhibit your skills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Mo Sun’er immediately shook her head and squeezed out a smile. “It’s not as complicated as you think; I’m pretty happy in the Three Flavour Hall. Although Su Tao’s character is a little terrible, he treats his colleagues pretty well. Everyone is like a big family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After half a year, Mo Sun’er has already started to get used to her life in the Three Flavour Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Su Tao’s character was a little overbearing, occasionally unreasonable, and a little perverse, he had a kind heart. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have taken in Fan Lihua and her daughter. She and Xiao Jingjing have formed a close relationship. So she was definitely not willing to leave the Three Flavour Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearts were made of flesh, and regardless of how ruthless one can get, they would also be affected by the environment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have no idea what Ruochen is thinking by letting a good sapling like you to train in such a tiny place like the Three Flavour Hall; it’s just burying your talent!” Wang Guofeng sighed and suggested, “I’m going over to greet him, are you coming?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go over, then!” Mo Sun’er sighed. Since they met, it would make her look guilty if she did not go over to greet him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Mo Sun’er stood up, Wang Guofeng briefly paused before he held onto her hand. Mo Sun’er was caught unexpected by this and her cheeks started burning. At the same time, she wondered why her Senior Brother would suddenly make such an intimate action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coming to her side, Wang Guofeng smiled. “Come with me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since she was young, Mo Sun’er has admired Wang Guofeng mainly due to the lack of the opposite gender around her, and another fact that Wang Guofeng was publicly acknowledged as a leader amongst their generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young girls were always dreaming about a romantic relationship, and they would always like the brightest star. So since young, Mo Sun’er had a crush on Wang Guofeng, but her respected Senior Sister already had an engagement with Wang Guofeng. Hence, there was a displacement of her feelings. So even if Liu Ruochen and Wang Guofeng’s engagement has fallen out, Mo Sun’er still believed that they’re the most suitable pair, and they would surely get back together in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sun’er wanted to greet you!” Wang Guofeng was standing, while Su Tao was seated. So it appeared like he was overlooking the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a faint smile, Su Tao responded, “I’ve seen the both of you too, but I decided against greeting you out of fear that I might disrupt the two of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you introduce me to these two beauties here?” Wang Guofeng casually chatted with Su Tao, which made Mo Sun’er feel uncomfortable. Especially that hand which Wang Guofeng was holding, her palm was covered in sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knitting his brows, Su Tao’s glance fell on Mo Sun’er and sighed, “We’ve never been considered as friends, and the reason why I’m talking to you is plainly due to Sun’er. As for my friends, there’s no need for you to get to know them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t say that!” Wang Guofeng did not give up as he looked at Lu Shimiao for a long time before he slapped his forehead. “This must be the Paediatrics Doctor from Jianghuai Hospital, right? I seemingly have a recollection of your surname being Lu! I never expected that you would have such a big daughter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, during Qin Meimei’s episode, Wang Guofeng and Lu Shimiao once met.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Politely nodding her head, Lu Shimiao replied, “Hello, Physician Wang!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, Wang Guofeng suggested, “It’s hard for us to encounter each other, so why don’t we have a meal together?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s not!” Mo Sun’er pulled her hand back and continued, “Senior Brother, let’s not disrupt others!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrugging his shoulder, Wang Guofeng smiled. “Sun’er, you’re currently working in Su Tao’s Three Flavour Hall, and as your Senior Brother, I have to speak up for you. So if someone is bullying you, I will not let him go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao glanced at Little Yuan. He noticed that her expression was a little nervous. Girls were generally sensitive. Hence, she wasn’t used to the atmosphere now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knocking his finger on the table, Su Tao solemnly said, “Wang Guofeng, leave now while I’m still talking to you nicely!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bursting out in laughter, Wang Guofeng pridefully glanced at Su Tao. “How dull! Since that’s the case, I shall not bother you, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, he held onto Mo Sun’er’s hand and they left for their table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Guofeng muttered something. Although his voice was faint, it was still heard by Su Tao and Lu Shimiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a good-looking lass, but what a pity that she’s a mute.” Wang Guofeng’s eyesight was keen, and he managed to see through Little Yuan’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Little Yuan, she buried her head deeper. She couldn’t speak, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t hear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao immediately jumped up. However, he was stopped by Lu Shimiao and she gently shook her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Little Yuan, he buried the rage in his heart. This was the first that he’s out with Little Yuan, so he couldn’t affect her mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother Guofeng, you lost your manners.” Mo Sun’er sighed as she felt complicated in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sun’er, why are you speaking up for outsiders?” Wang Guofeng locked his brows together. “If it wasn’t for Su Tao, would the relationship between your Senior Sister and I come to this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng had no idea why he was so enraged. But ever since he met Su Tao, he seemed to have changed into a new person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could only blame Su Tao for obstructing his path. The honor and glory that was initially his were slowly being taken away by Su Tao. Especially after he came to know that Song Sichen and Dou Fanggang accepted Su Tao as their inner disciple and passed on their medical skills to him, it practically drove him insane!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jealousy was the source of all crimes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, let’s go out and take a walk. Perhaps your mood might become better!” Mo Sun’er looked at the steak and fruit salad before her. Despite the sumptuous meal, she did not have any appetite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, we’ll take your suggestion. I have no appetite after seeing Su Tao!” Wang Guofeng stood up and took out a few hundred Yuan bills before placing them under a small dish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just when he wanted to grab onto Mo Sun’er’s hand, she dodged it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knitting his brow, Wang Guofeng made another attempt. This time, Mo Sun’er sighed and allowed Wang Guofeng to take her hand.</span></p>
