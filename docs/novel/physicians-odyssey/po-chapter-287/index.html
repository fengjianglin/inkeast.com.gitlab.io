 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Shui Junzhuo was surprised to see Su Tao turn around and leave. Nodding her head to express her apology to Cao Huaiqing, she swiftly chased after Su Tao. She felt that this wasn’t normal, since Su Tao wasn’t someone who’s unaware of etiquette, not to mention that he knew that Grandpa Cao was someone with status and identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xia Dechun saw Su Tao leaving, he was also surprised since the latter barely went in for a brief moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was he chased away?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao leaving without saying a single word left both Cao Huaiqing startled, and Cao Dingjun dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time Cao Dingjun has encountered a situation where someone would rudely walk out on him. Thus, he asked, “What’s going on? Didn’t that lass seem to be Junzhuo?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Huaiqing immediately explained, “Dad, that was the martial artist that Uncle Shui invited. Didn’t he perform a set of techniques to you before? That young man was the one who taught Uncle Shui. As for Junzhuo, she came together with the martial artist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since he was invited over to discuss about martial arts, why did he turn around and leave? You must be hiding something from me.” As someone at his age, it wasn’t easy for anyone to fool Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Cao Huaiqing decided to confess to his father, “His actual identity is actually a physician, and he treated Uncle Shui some time ago. This is also the reason why Uncle Shui recommended him over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Su Tao had already left, there was no harm in him coming clean to his father. Otherwise, his father would be even more furious if he hid something from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Dingjun’s expression went through several changes as he slowly sorted the logic. Curiosity was an innate quality of humans. Why did that brat turn around upon seeing him without saying anything?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he started to speculate in his heart. Did he have an incurable disease? After a brief pondering, Cao Dingjun waved his hand towards Cao Huaiqing. “Bring him here. I have some things I would like to ask him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words instantly made Cao Huaiqing rejoice. Although Su Tao’s tactic was somewhat rude and risky, it was brilliant. At least his father was now willing to meet with a physician, which was a piece of good news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being somewhat rude, it was also a tactic. Against the other physicians, Cao Dingjun wouldn’t even want to meet them, but he had shown an interest in meeting Su Tao. Although this method was a little graceless, it was understandable for his wits to be used here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go bring him in!” Cao Huaiqing immediately rushed out of the study room and chased after him. But it was a pity that he couldn’t find Su Tao anywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are they?” Cao Huaiqing asked as he turned to Xia Dechun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They already left.” Xia Dechun replied with a blank expression. He had no idea what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stomping his foot, Cao Huaiqing rushed to the courtyard. He yelled a few times when he saw Su Tao and Shui Junzhuo getting in a cab. However, the cab paid no attention to him and drove off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao wasn’t using a tactic, he actually had no intention of treating Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This had also left Cao Huaiqing dumbfounded because it wasn’t an act. Could there be any special reason?</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you leave?” Shui Junzhuo looked at Su Tao with perplexion in the cab. He was akin to a monk in meditation without any emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because I can’t treat his illness!” Su Tao frankly replied and continued, “Since I can’t treat it, why should I continue to stay there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, Su Tao had already broken the rule for Cao Dingjun, and this was also the reason why he would have such rude behavior. Although it seemed like he was rude to Cao Dingjun, he was actually preserving the prestige of TCM.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his view, a doctor was a noble profession. He could be humiliated, but he couldn’t allow TCM to be humiliated by the ignorant. Cao Dingjun was someone who didn’t believe in doctors, and this was the reason why Su Tao decisively left after taking a glance since he did not want any conflicts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t treat it? Is it a serious illness?” Shui Junzhuo probed. She knew that Su Tao must have his reasons. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have flown all the way over to Minnan Province. With Su Tao’s character, it was unquestionably impossible for him to do things half-heartedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Illnesses are separated into different levels of severity. If the patient isn’t willing to receive treatment, you will be helpless with a small sickness, even if don’t you have superb illnesses.” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then you know what his illness is? Can’t you use ingenious ways to have him take medicine without him being aware?” Shui Junzhuo was still trying to persuade Su Tao. After all, this was the plan that Sire Shui came up with for Su Tao to treat Cao Dingjun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, you’re only treating the symptoms but not the roots.” Su Tao frankly answered, before he continued, “Hiding a sickness for fear of treatment. Sooner or later, it will be hopeless. Not to mention that his illness isn’t something that can be treated with just medication.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing that Su Tao wasn’t putting on airs, Shui Junzhuo sighed. Suddenly, her phone rang with a call from Cao Huaiqing. “Didn’t you say that he’s here to treat? Why did he suddenly leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stretching his hand over to Shui Junzhuo, the latter passed her phone over to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Receiving the phone, Su Tao frankly explained, “I’m sorry, Mr. Cao. I can’t help with your father’s illness, and I’m afraid that you’ll have to seek someone else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief shock, Cao Huaiqing anxiously pursued, “Do you know what illness he has, then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mental illness.” Su Tao responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Cao Dingjun was puzzled, thinking that he misheard it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Putting it in a nutshell, it’s Senile Dementia!” Su Tao patiently explained, “If your father found out that I’ve diagnosed him with Senile Dementia, would he be willing to receive treatment from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Bian Que’s Heart Book, Senile Dementia was mentioned. It was a mental illness that occurred in people who were in their middle age when they exhausted their heart’s blood and were in refusal of any treatment. This would lead to their vitality being gradually exhausted. In scientific statistics, there was a 50% chance of those over eighty suffering from Senile Dementia. In western medicine, it was called Alzheimer's Disease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Su Tao’s explanation, Cao Huaiqing was instantly left speechless. If someone told him that he was suffering from Senile Dementia, even he would slap the other party. Thus, he was skeptical about Su Tao’s examination. “Recently, my father is only having discomfort, but his mental condition is clear. His memory is better than anyone…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s because the illness hasn’t broken out. The moment it breaks out, he will show symptoms of memory decline and other negative conditions.” Su Tao continued to patiently explain, “According to my estimation, the breakout will be two weeks from now. So you guys need to make preparations for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Cao Huaiqing heard Su Tao’s words, even he felt a wave of anger burning in his heart. Although his father’s health wasn’t in good condition, it wasn’t that bad. Wasn’t Su Tao cursing his father?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing Cao Huaiqing’s thoughts, Su Tao sighed, “Mr. Cao, I know that you won’t believe me, and this is part of the reason why I left. If I continued to stay, I would only create more misunderstandings and conflicts. Hence, I decided to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking a deep breath, Cao Huaiqing replied with a cold tone, “Anyway, thanks for coming over!” When he finished, he immediately ended the call.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did he say?” Xia Dechun glanced at Cao Huaiqing. He was also curious about the reason why Su Tao left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He said that my father is suffering from Senile Dementia! How is that possible?” Cao Huaiqing shook his head and continued, “That’s simply ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Xia Dechun was a doctor practicing western medicine, he immediately compared Cao Dingjun’s condition to Senile Dementia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Senile Dementia wasn’t easy to detect, and it required a series of examinations, such as testing the psychology, blood, kidney, liver, Vitamin B12 density, thyroid gland, and brain functions. Although he knew that some veteran physicians could detect it through inspections, Su Tao had only gone in for barely thirty seconds, and it exceeded his range of comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be too bothered. Although Sire Cao has some coughs and other small illnesses, it shouldn’t be serious. Since he’s against taking medication, I can prescribe a few medicinal cuisines for the old man’s daily consumption. He will be able to swiftly recover.” Su Tao’s appearance had given Xia Dechun a few good ideas. Since Sire Cao wasn’t willing to take medication, then he could try using medicinal cuisines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately thought of the few prescriptions often used by the healthcare team. After that, he even called a few TCM specialists from the team and finally came up with a meal plan for a week.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Huaiqing’s mood instantly turned better. Although he encountered the unreliable Su Tao, Xia Dechun managed to come up with a suitable solution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the attitude of humans. When you walk into a hospital, and the doctor prescribed you a pile of expensive medicine, you would buy it despite the price. But when you’re in a situation where you feel unwell, but the doctor claims that you’re fine, you will feel uneasy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Cao Huaiqing returned to the study room, he did not tell Cao Dingjun about Su Tao’s examination. After all, this piece of news wasn’t reliable, and it would only light a fire in his father’s temper. However, his heart was filled with complaints for Sire Shui, since the person he invited nearly became more of a hindrance than a helper.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the cab, Shui Junzhuo immediately reported the entire situation to Sire Shui. When the latter heard everything, he sighed since he knew that Su Tao wouldn’t blurt out nonsense with his character and medical skills. Recalling the incident when he was suffering from the loss of speech, Su Tao also said that his condition would worsen in a few days, which came true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Shire Shui sighed, “I got it. Get Su Tao to answer the phone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao took the phone, he smiled. “Old man, sorry to disappoint you. Please understand my difficulties.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sire Shui nodded before asking, “Since you’ve determined that his illness would worsen in a couple of weeks, why don’t you suggest some precautions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Su Tao replied, “The most distinct symptoms of Senile Dementia is the decline of memory. It won't be that terrible if the patient is in a familiar environment. But if he is placed in an unfamiliar environment, then the breakout will be dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will get them to pay more attention and have someone by Old Cao’s side at all times.” Sire Shui sighed before smiling. “When his illness breaks out and he’s willing to receive treatment, what are the chances of him being completely treated?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It won’t be easy.” As usual, Su Tao did not give any guarantee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, we’ll settle with that for the time being. Thanks for your trouble.” Sire Shui also knew that it wasn’t the right time for Su Tao to make a move. He could only wait and see if Cao Dingjun’s illness really worsens before getting Su Tao to come in.</span></p>
