 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Dou Fanggang supported the old man up, he warned in a solemn voice, “Your chronic heart disease is serious, and you have to take your medicine periodically. If I’ve not guessed incorrectly, you must not have taken any medicine for the past week.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man’s expression changed. Dou Fanggang was spot-on, so an awkward smile crept on his face. “Every medicine has its side effects. When I went for a checkup recently, my doctor told me that there was a drastic improvement in my chronic heart disease. So I thought of trying to stop taking my medicine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the common nature of humankind. The moment they heard that there was a drastic improvement, they would feel that it’s suitable to stop taking medicine. But in fact, there were some diseases with medication cycles that cannot be stopped. The moment they stop, it would have a dire effect on their body’s recovery and it would worsen instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Especially for chronic heart disease, since it was classified as a disease caused by the deterioration of the organ’s function. Hence, it didn’t mean that your organ function would recover the moment you stop taking medicine, but it would just stop deteriorating. However, medication was still required.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A doctor would never tell his patient that a chronic heart disease has recovered pretty well, and they would only phrase it as the condition was well under control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two possibilities for this old man to stop his medicine. One being the costly price tag that comes along with the drug, and the other was a common mistake committed by everyone — forgetfulness. But no matter what, the old man’s chronic heart disease was related to the fact that he has stopped taking his medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Dou Fanggang warned with a stern expression, “For patients with chronic heart diseases, you can’t stop your medication as it’s akin to suicide. After you return, you have to continue your medication. Otherwise, the incident today will occur again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man wasn’t purposely trying to create a problem, but he was only joining a queue to make a purchase and receive some money out of it. However, it was mainly because he was angered by Hou Cheng and suffered an attack. He had suffered an attack from his chronic heart disease in the past, and it wasn’t a good feeling to brush shoulders with death. So when he calmed down now, he was lingering in fear since he knew that he nearly lost his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone possessed the will to live, and he did not wish for his life to be thrown away here due to a dispute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re fine now, you just have to continue taking your medication when you return.” Dou Fanggang appeased after examining the old man’s complexion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man could feel that his heart was beating more powerfully, all thanks to Dou Fanggang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Dou Fanggang has saved his life, his first response was to express his gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t often that someone you saved would come to bite you back, since most people have benevolence and knew how to be grateful. So if someone helped them, they would surely try to repay their benefactor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Physician Dou.” The old man cupped his hands together in the direction of Dou Fanggang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Dou Fanggang smiled. Although he had a slightly more stubborn character, he had righteous medical ethics. Since the Three Flavour Hall has encountered a problem, he naturally wanted to help Su Tao. Raising his voice, he said, “I, Old Dou, am here today in the Three Flavour Hall hoping to help the locals here with my ability. I can tell that most of you are here to trash the place, and it isn’t directed at me, but there are some other factors involved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I would like to ask for everyone to give me face in this matter. If you’re only making medicine purchases and not here for consultation, please leave. After all, there are people that need my help, and I will not be staying in He City for too long. So, wasting my time is the same as wasting everyone’s time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he spoke, the hall was instantly engulfed in silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, Su Tao gave a thumbs up towards Dou Fanggang, since he wasn’t in a position to interfere in this situation. However, he never expected that the latter would resolve this problem so efficiently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan has planned this well and even went as far as planting a spy amongst his employees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had to admit that Bai Fan was a formidable opponent, and if Dou Fanggang did not step out in time, this grand opening might have been a mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing before Dou Fanggang, Su Tao added, “Honestly speaking, I’m filled with guilt today. I did not pay for Senior Dou’s appearance in the Three Flavour Hall, and he sincerely wants to help both my Three Flavour Hall and the locals here. However, all of you are here to purchase herbs, which makes me feel guilty for the fact that such a specialist like Senior Dou is being neglected.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Dou Fanggang smiled. “It’s not important for me to be neglected, but I’m a little worried, since I can tell that many customers here have some ailments. And as a physician, I’m depressed that I couldn’t help everyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man that Dou Fanggang has just treated waved his hand and said, “What we’re doing today isn’t right, and I’ve personally experienced Physician Dou’s medical skills. Calling it magical is an understatement. Everyone should grasp this opportunity to take a look at your illness. If there’s nothing wrong with you, then don’t hold others back. Speaking it blatantly, there might not be another opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the old man spoke, two police officers arrived and one of them asked, “Who called for the police?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was the one that called for the police!” The old man’s expression was swept by guilt as he explained, “But it’s all a misunderstanding, and it has been resolved now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man was guilty to begin with, so he did not feel the need to blow up the matter. Hence, he did not mention Hou Cheng slapping him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officer locked his brows together and unhappily replied, “Don’t call the police if there’s nothing. Is it fun? Come, take a trip with me back to the station.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding people were all familiar with the old man, so they immediately came forth to stop the officers and explained the entire matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The officer was depressed, but it was common that a dispute between both parties would already be resolved by the time they arrived. This could only be considered a small dispute, and they weren’t in a position to interfere. Hence, he called the old man over and gave a few strict warnings before leaving.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan was in a good mood when he saw a police vehicle outside the Three Flavour Hall. But when he saw the car leaving shortly after without making any arrests, his face sank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Luo Ran came up in a hurry and reported, “There’s a change to the plan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?” Bai Fan unhappily said with his brows raised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everything was initially going according to our plan, but something happened when Hou Cheng tried to create a scene. An old man suddenly suffered a heart attack, but Dou Fanggang treated him.” Luo Ran nervously said, since he knew his Senior Brother’s character. Bai Fan was someone who would reward and punish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, why is everyone dispersing?” Bai Fan pursued as he balled his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That old man has some reputation in the surroundings, and he spoke good words for the Three Flavour Hall…” Even Luo Ran was baffled by the sudden change of events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Increase the money!” Bai Fan gnashed his teeth. “Add another ¥100 to everyone! I don’t believe that there is anything in the world that cannot be resolved with money!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Luo Ran responded, “I will contact the other side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Contact them here!” Bai Fan instructed in annoyance. He wanted to find the problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Luo Ran immediately made the call and said, “We’ll increase the money as long as everyone continues to clog the Three Flavour Hall!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…this is troublesome. A few people received a free consultation from that TCM grandmaster, and the news has already spread out. His fame is swiftly spreading out. Right now, the 600 people there all know that TCM grandmaster is skilled, and they can't continue to clog up the door.” The middle-man was also helpless as he continued, “My uncle suffered a bone fracture many years ago. Although he had a cast done and recovered, his wrist joint was out of place, and that TCM grandmaster easily fixed it. Your fees of ¥100-200 pale in comparison to a treatment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t bite more than what you can chew!” Luo Ran thought that the middle-man was trying to negotiate the price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is really not a matter that concerns money!” After a brief pause, the middle-man continued, “I won’t take this job anymore. So far, two to three hundred people have done as you asked, and there isn’t much money that remains. I’ll just give you a discount next time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Luo Ran felt that this fellow was really shameless. But just when he wanted to curse at the latter, the call was already hung up from the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry! Senior Brother, I never expected that these people would be so unreliable.” Luo Ran looked at Bai Fan’s cold gaze and felt his knees going soft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gently patting Luo Ran’s shoulder, Bai Fan sighed, “You’re not as steady as Ole Seventh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the sudden change of events had nothing to do with Luo Ran, he still had to be held responsible, since he was the one establishing the contacts in this entire plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Fan also did not bother staying in the new branch and chose to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was futile for him to continue waiting, since he could guess how the situation would develop. The 600 actors that he arranged over must have turned into mouths for the Three Flavour Hall now, and the news was spreading swiftly. Even an old man knew how to use a smartphone, and they only needed to leave a comment on the social media platform for it to be a free advertisement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, Bai Fan hoped for the 600 actors to clog the doors of the Three Flavour Hall, but he never expected that they would all turn into the Three Flavour Hall’s first batch of customers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He practically lifted a rock and dropped it on his own foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flaw in the plan was that he had underestimated the charm of a TCM grandmaster and the common folks’ fear for illness.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Dou Fanggang’s management, the situation has calmed down and Su Tao also felt that it was a fluke. Bai Fan has planned this well, and his schemes were practically one after another; there was no path of retreat for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Hou Cheng hadn’t coincidentally caused that old man to suffer an attack before Dou Fanggang stood out to treat him, their grand opening would have been doomed to be a grand failure instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao came to the back of the pharmacy, he saw Hou Cheng tied up on a chair with his face swollen. Standing to the side, Xia Yu was furiously looking at the latter. At this moment, Hou Cheng was terrified of Xia Yu and did not dare to look at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This brat was pretty arrogant in the beginning, but he finally behaved himself after I fixed him.” Xia Yu rubbed his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let him go.” Su Tao spoke after a brief hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fellow is a spy, and you want to let him go so easily?” Xia Yu looked at Su Tao in disbelief and reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teaching him a lesson is enough. After all, he’s just a pawn.” Seeing that Xia Yu wasn’t moving, Su Tao personally went to undo the rope that bound Hou Cheng and said, “Remember, don’t do anything of this nature in the future anymore. You can rely on this to earn money, but you won’t be able to spend the money at ease.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hou Cheng immediately stood up upon being freed and gave a complicated glance at Su Tao before leaving with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re too benevolent.” Xia Yu commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That depends on who I’m dealing with.” Su Tao’s expression turned grave as he continued, “In the end, Hou Cheng is just a pawn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking risks and committing a crime for a pawn wasn’t worth it.</span></p>
