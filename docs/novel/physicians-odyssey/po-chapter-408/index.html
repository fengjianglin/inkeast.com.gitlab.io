 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to Hanzhou City, Su Tao first brought Qin Meimei to the Three Flavour Cosmetics International’s building to meet with Yan Jing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding onto her cup of tea, Qin Meimei incessantly spoke, describing the entire process of how Su Tao and her slapped the couple. At the same time, Qin Meimei also announced to Yan Jing that her irregular menstruation period has been cured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that, Su Tao couldn’t help reminding Qin Meimei, “You still have to take the medicine that I’ve prescribed you. Not only can it treat your hormone imbalance, but it’s also effective for your digestive system. You drink often, which has resulted in your digestive system being affected and you becoming skinny. As time passes, there will surely be a problem with your body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Meimei smiled. “Please be reassured. I won’t torture myself, and I will live for myself in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she soon knitted her brows and worriedly said, “But Li Yede is powerful, and now that we’ve completely fallen out with him, I’m worried that he might take revenge against you guys. But I already know that that fellow is cunning and plays underhanded tactics. So I’ve made up my mind to seize Apex Cloud Corporation back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing knew that Qin Meimei wasn’t a pushover, so she analysed with her brows knitted, “The Apex Cloud Corporation concerns real estate development, and their foundation is sturdy. So it won’t be easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving her hand, Qin Meimei smiled. “I’ve helped Li Yede for so many years, so I know who’s harboring ambitions. I only need to coerce them a little to shake the Apex Cloud Corporation’s foundation before entering and obtaining it. Then again, I will also need your help. I need funds of roughly ¥10,000,000,000.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“¥10,000,000,000? That is not a small sum.” Yan Jing could roughly guess Qin Meimei’s strategy for seizing the Apex Cloud Corporation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, she only would leak a few harmful news about the Apex Cloud Corporation for the stocks to fall before making use of the advantage to buy shares. In the end, she just has to cooperate with those ambitious shareholders to dismiss Li Yede and the management team would definitely undergo a shuffle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a starving camel was still more significant than a horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Apex Cloud Cooperation was colossal and it’s considered an excellent blue-chip stock in the financial market with a stable performance. Most of the people buying shares were long-term investors, and even if the price drops, at least ¥10,000,000,000 was needed to buy in at a low price to ensure that the shares could exceed Li Yede.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the two women discussing how to deal with Li Yede, Su Tao truly felt afraid at how vicious women could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he couldn’t understand what they’re talking about, he had a premonition that Li Yede would have his fame and life ruined by these two women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, there’s a saying that one would rather offend scum than to offend a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the two of them openly discussed their scheme, it was also a message to Su Tao that the two of them trusted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Jing could be considered as Su Tao’s woman, and it was natural for her to believe in Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Qin Meimei, not only was he her nominal superior, he also helped her deal with Li Yede and vented her anger out. Hence, he was naturally qualified to be her comrade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His trip with Qin Meimei to pay Li Yede a visit was initially out of interest, but after seeing such a significant change in Qin Meimei’s attitude, he knew his effort wasn’t in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had his eyes on Qin Meimei’s business ability since she has once supported Li Yede to establish his business empire. Hence, her vision was greater than an ordinary person’s, which he was currently lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Qin Meimei previously promised to join the Qihuang Charity Funds, Su Tao had a feeling that she wasn’t focusing on the funds’ development for some reason. Now that the knot in her heart has been resolved, she could now focus on her work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting it in a nutshell, Qin Meimei left Yan Jing’s office happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao, Yan Jing smiled. “Congratulations, you’ve gained yourself a powerful helper. I can foresee that the Qihuang Charity Funds will turn into a formidable funds management company in a short period of time since Qin Meimei is knowledgeable on funding channels. In finance, it’s usually not dependant on the project but the investors, which Qin Meimei is even more formidable than me in this factor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She has her advantage, and you have your own merits. But I was really startled when you guys were talking about ¥10,000,000,000. Are you able to get so much money?” Su Tao sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Yan Jing winked, she smiled. “She was just casually talking about it to intimidate me. Don’t underestimate her capability. As long as she’s willing, she naturally has her ways to deal with Li Yede, and she has ways to resolve her funding issue. So she won’t ask me for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chat between women was truly hard to decipher, which Su Tao helplessly sighed, “The conversation between the two of you was on a completely different level, and I couldn’t join in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“According to my speculation, Qin Meimei will probably invite venture capitalists to invest in the Qihuang Charity Funds for it to reach a swiftly terrifying level before conducting a takeover on the Apex Cloud Corporation. That also means that if it goes well, the Qihuang Charity Funds will become the largest shareholder in the Apex Cloud Corporation in the near future.” Yan Jing patiently explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao still couldn’t understand any of it and felt that his head was aching. “I’m not a businessman, I’m ultimately a doctor. Regardless of how far the Qihuang Charity Funds develops, I will retain my initial intention for it that it must be developed on the foundation of TCM to help the weak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Examining Su Tao, Yan Jing shook her head and smiled. “Hypocrite!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A naughty smile crept on Su Tao’s lips as he walked to Yan Jing and hooked her chin with his finger. “You’re getting pretty bold now; you even dare to insult your husband?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While sourly pushing Su Tao’s finger away, Yan Jing said, “Don’t try this with me. This is an office, so behave yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Without your orders, can your subordinates barge in? So you don’t have to worry about our private moments being disrupted, and we can do whatever we wish!” Su Tao boldly teased as he looked at Yan Jing in her formal dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, he straightforwardly clasped Yan Jing’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, she did not refuse and looked at Su Tao. She knew that this young man has revitalised her lifeless heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Yan Jing closed her eyes, Su Tao lowered his head and kissed her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Yan Jing pushed Su Tao away and smiled. “Alright, behave yourself. I’m nearly forced to a corner by you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the door was knocked, which Su Tao was briefly stunned before he helplessly stepped back and sat before Yan Jing.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t this too much of a coincidence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Geng Hong entered with a pile of documents. She first politely nodded her head at Su Tao before handing the pile over to Yan Jing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Yan Jing signed the documents, she glanced at Su Tao with the corner of her eyes while feeling smug in her heart. She knew that Su Tao was feeling depressed now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Director Yan, there’s a management meeting in five minutes, and everyone has already arrived.” Geng Hong could see that Yan Jing was in a pretty good mood since the process of her signing the documents was smooth; she wasn’t picky like how she usually was when she sorted the documents out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Yan Jing signed the last document, she said to Geng Hong, “You can leave first. I’ll come shortly after!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Geng Hong left, she closed the door behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While weakly shrugging her shoulders, Yan Jing smiled. “Hear that? You still have four minutes before I leave for the meeting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let’s kiss then!” Su Tao weakly sighed. “We can only kiss with so little time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Yan Jing blushed, she lightly nodded her head.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Yan Jing left her office, Su Tao also no longer had the intention of staying in her office.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the moment he sat in his car, his phone rang. It was a call from his master, Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Yongde escaped!” Jiang Qinghan abruptly said before Su Tao could even send his greetings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao locked his brows together. The figure of that person who manipulated insects flashed in his mind. “Prisons are covered with impenetrable walls nowadays, not to mention the strict security. So, how did he escape?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Jiang Qinghan explained, “He’s extremely cunning. Yesterday at lunch, a fight broke out in the prison and he suffered a heavy blow to his head, losing vital signs shortly after. Despite immediate medical attention, he was ultimately pronounced dead. However, his corpse disappeared from the morgue the next day along with the mysterious death of the manager in the morgue!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief consideration, Su Tao’s tone turned weighty, “Zhao Yongde is an expert with insect manipulation, so it’s not impossible for him to take a special medication to fake his death. As for that manager, they must have died because of Zhao Yongde. This person is extremely cunning and brutal. I even suspect that he will take action against you, so you have to take caution.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pause, Jiang Qinghan replied, “I’m telling you this news to warn you. Since he managed to successfully escape, he will definitely take revenge against you and I. I’m experienced with criminals like him, but you have to be cautious. Before he’s arrested, you must exercise caution. After all, we’re in the light while he’s in the dark.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao responded, “You must let me know the moment he’s discovered. He’s tricky and unusual, not to mention that he’s even proficient in using the poison of insects. You guys might be trained officers, but you guys have no experience in dealing with such techniques; not to mention that you guys might even fall into his trap. Since I’m a member of the specialist team now, I’m qualified to investigate with you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll notify you the moment we have any news!” Jiang Qinghan agreed after a brief hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was necessary for Su Tao to partake in this mission. After all, he could render immediate medical treatment if anyone was poisoned to reduce the casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the bad news, Su Tao’s heart was clouded with gloom. After all, he couldn’t afford to underestimate Zhao Yongde, who was an expert with poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he returned to the Three Flavour Hall, he noticed Yan Sha and Little Xue standing outside waiting for him with their backpacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holding onto Little Xue’s hand, Yan Sha walked over and smiled. “Senior Brother, Little Xue insisted on thanking you, so I brought her over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Xue was bashful with her head lowered as she stuttered, “M-my mother… said to come for a meal if you’re free.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Little Xue, Su Tao suddenly recalled something and gently patted himself on his forehead. “Little Xue, go home quickly and bring your father here. I’ll take a look at your father’s hand!”</span></p>
