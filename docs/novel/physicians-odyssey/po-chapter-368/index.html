 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Rangure walked past the lady, that lady had shock and perplexion in her eyes. When Rangure smiled at her, even she was captivated by the former’s smile, even as a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can there be such a bewitching woman?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Hence, the woman unhappily entered the hotel room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who’s what woman?” She asked in a solemn voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Staring at her for a long time, Wang Guofeng asked, “How is that related to you, Ailian?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was Zhang Ailian, a nurse from the province hospital who has had multiple collaborations with Wang Guofeng. Half a month ago, Wang Guofeng threw out the bait and the two of them united. She has now become one of Wang Guofeng’s lovers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Ailian felt her nose turning sour with tears flickering in her eyes. “Wang Guofeng, what are you treating me as? Am I a tool for you to sate your lust?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Guofeng stood up, he sighed and embraced Zhang Ailian’s shoulders. Moving his lips next to her ears, he whispered, “Ailian, how can you say that? We have feelings between us, and that woman from earlier is a partner of mine. She’s the largest investor for the Medicine Deity Corporation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhang Ailian struggled, she broke free from Wang Guofeng’s embrace. “Men are all liars! So you’re the same as my husband, you guys are just playboys!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knitting his brows, Wang Guofeng unhappily said, “Zhang Ailian, don’t push it. You sleep with me willingly as you satisfy me while I help you get a promotion. I don’t owe you anything. If you’re that unreasonable, leave now and end the relationship between us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhang Ailian looked at Wang Guofeng, she was angered to the point of being speechless. Even if she knew that her relationship with Wang Guofeng wouldn’t last long, she never expected him to be so relentless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wasn’t a fickle woman. Before getting together with Wang Guofeng, she has always been keeping to her role. However, Wang Guofeng has placed quite a bit of effort into her. Firstly, he would send her flowers on a daily basis before using work as an excuse to have more interactions. In the end, Wang Guofeng took the opportunity while they were working overtime and forced himself onto her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the beginning, Zhang Ailian wanted to call the cops on him. But after Wang Guofeng’s constant apology and even gave her a car, her heart softened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was human. Regardless of gender, they would always be tempted by something in life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Wang Guofeng’s constant assaults, Zhang Ailian found herself falling deeper. In the beginning, she thought that Wang Guofeng committed the mistake because he was infatuated with her. However, she had no idea that Wang Guofeng was only seeking excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By subduing a married wife, he found the excitement that he never felt in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You would treat things the best when you hadn’t gotten it. But once you’ve got it, you would feel tired of it and choose to give up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Zhang Ailian wasn’t obedient, then Wang Guofeng wouldn’t hesitate to give up on her and seek someone new.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry. I was wrong!” Zhang Ailian lowered her head with a grievance in her eyes. Just an hour ago, she lied to her husband when she received a call from Wang Guofeng and secretly came over to Hanzhou City to have an affair. However, she never expected that she would find a charming woman coming out from Wang Guofeng’s room that made her feel foolish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, you’re not in the wrong!” While looking at Zhang Ailian lowering her head, Wang Guofeng immediately changed his tone, “I was in the wrong since I did not clearly explain things with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, he took out an exquisite jewelry box from his luggage. When he opened it, there was a silver bracelet. “Here’s a gift for you. Although it’s made of silver, it has high purity. It is something that my grandmother left for me, and I’m giving it to you now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Ailian was stunned by Wang Guofeng’s actions before she held her mouth and looked at the latter in disbelief. She knew that Wang Guofeng was from a family of Imperial Physicians, and something that was passed down from his grandmother was definitely good stuff. Hence, she was touched that Wang Guofeng would give her a gift that holds such great significance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Guofeng… I…” Zhang Ailian realised that she was too excited to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng slowly put the bracelet on Zhang Ailian to show the meaning and worth of this gift.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a tactic that Wang Guofeng thought out to woo girls. That silver bracelet was actually something that could be commonly found, and even the box was more expensive than the gift. But by containing it in an exquisite box, it would further show the worth of the bracelet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something that he initially prepared for Mo Sun’er, and the story was also fabricated. But at this moment, he could only use it on another target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hush! Don’t speak, let us enjoy this moment for now!” Wang Guofeng placed his finger on Zhang Ailian’s lips and wiped her lipstick before sucking on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Ailian felt her inner organs tremble before she lowered her head. “You’re so bad!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this instant, Wang Guofeng’s skills have reached great heights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was mainly because he was a physician, and he understood women in both their bodies and hearts. By using his skills to woo girls, he was simply unstoppable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bad? Girls like bad boys!” Wang Guofeng laughed as he pointed towards the washroom. “Quickly take a shower. I can’t wait any longer!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhang Ailian’s brows were gently raised, she hung her handbag on the wardrobe and gracefully entered the washroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait! Wear this when you’re done!” Wang Guofeng retrieved a bag from his luggage. “This is another gift for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Ailian was baffled before she opened the bag, and her face blushed. It was a piece of revealing black-laced&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enVN819VN819&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNT9YXLeQsbZtAkkE5hgFDapXJzxHA:1575736548341&amp;q=lingerie&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0reSJ_KPmAhXDXisKHaK3CMgQkeECKAB6BAgNECY" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">lingerie</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;that wouldn’t cover anything. Although she was having an affair, she wasn’t familiar with many things and asked, “How do I wear this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just try it. I bought it according to your size, and I’m sure that you will like it!” Wang Guofeng gently brushed Zhang Ailian’s nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He liked how Zhang Ailian looked bashful and ignorant at this moment. It was something that most men were fond of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How do you know my size?” Zhang Ailian sighed as she glanced at Wang Guofeng in a complicated light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Guofeng burst into laughter, he flicked his finger. “We’ve already done it so many times, so how could I not know your size?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lecher!” Zhang Ailian rolled her eyes at Wang Guofeng before she closed the door. However, there was a seam that remained open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slut, see how I’ll mess with you later!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Wang Guofeng’s inner voice sounded before he looked at the bathroom’s door that wasn’t fully closed with a seam left open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Wang Guofeng was about to remove his clothes and head into the shower, his gaze fell onto Zhang Ailian’s handbag. Sneaking his way over, he used a scanner that he brought with him at all times to scan the bag. After seeing no light indication, he felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was living a life of debauchery, he was still cautious with his actions. After all, it would be dire if he fell for a trap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Wang Guofeng’s recent interest was with married women. Firstly, he wanted to taste a life that’s more exciting on the bed; secondly, a woman with a family was easier to control. Despite how much havoc they were outside, they would become virtuous the moment they return. So she would be more cautious with her actions and fearful of it being revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, Wang Guofeng did not enter the room, but took out his phone to send Mo Sun’er a message, “Are you safely at home?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He soon received a message from Mo Sun’er, “I’m already home. Thank you, Senior Brother. I’m happy today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile appeared on the corner of Wang Guofeng’s lips. Although he did not succeed, he still took a step further with Mo Sun’er. After a brief pondering, he turned his phone into vibration mode, since he did not want it to disrupt his activity today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, a noise came from the bathroom and Zhang Ailian walked out. Her expression wasn’t normal. She held her hand to her chest while the other hand covered the region between her thighs. Her hair was wrapped with a towel and her skin was flickering with gloss due to the steam. Under the hazy light in the room, it was akin to a golden veil on her that reflected her shadow onto the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Ailian’s style was similar to those girls from a wealthy family, and she was normally hard working with her work. With such a great comparison, Wang Guofeng glanced at Zhang Ailian and he felt his heart rippling. All the negative emotions he felt earlier have disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is too… I can’t get used to it. I’ll go change it immediately!” Zhang Ailian didn’t even dare to look at Wang Guofeng. She lowered her head and wanted to return to the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Guofeng strode over and grabbed onto her arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re so charming! Why do you need to change?” Wang Guofeng smiled before he nibbled on Zhang Ailian’s nape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t!” Zhang Ailian rejected. “Don’t be in such a hurry! This is too thin, and I’m cold when I’m wearing it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the most bizarre reason that I’ve heard. Are you trying to make me laugh?” Wang Guofeng was briefly stunned before smiling. “You demoness, so you were acting it. See how I’ll deal with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You go shower first!” As a nurse, Zhang Ailian had a slight mysophobia, so she gently pushed Wang Guofeng away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng grinned. Her push made him feel even more enticed instead and provoked the hormones in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing that she couldn’t resist anymore, Zhang Ailian allowed Wang Guofeng to have his way with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, her phone rang and she said, “Don’t move! My husband called!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since she started her affair with Wang Guofeng, she set a special tune for her husband due to her guilty conscience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You trying to scare me? Do you think I’m afraid? Even if he’s standing before me, I’ll still do you!” Wang Guofeng sneered before he took the phone with his other hand and picked up the call &nbsp;before signaling for Zhang Ailian to talk to her husband.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Ailian was terrified. She did not expect that Wang Guofeng would be so playful. But since the call has been answered, she was helpless, and she could only speak a few words with her husband.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, nefarious thoughts blazed within Wang Guofeng’s heart as he admired how Zhang Ailian lied to her husband. It was truly a unique fetish.</span></p>
