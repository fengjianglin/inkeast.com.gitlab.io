 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 6 - 3 Offences in a Row</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he allowed that paint to remain there, then it would make others feel that the Three Flavour Hall was about to close down, despite its bad business to begin with. Thus, he engaged a renovation company to repaint the walls, which they quickly responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the developer’s party arrived at this moment and they started to shove the construction workers aside. It was a middle-aged man that led the team. Donned in a Chinese yellow gown with loose silk trousers and black leather shoes with a height at roughly 5’9”. He was followed by a bunch of goons with tools in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am Mo Dong, representing the Hongsheng Group to negotiate about the demolition.” The first impression from the middle-aged man was that he was a man with ill intentions hidden behind his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had long guessed that the Hongsheng Group would send someone over. However, he stood firmly at the centre of the Three Flavour Hall’s door as he replied, “Sorry, but I don’t accept any negotiation. The Three Flavour Hall will not be demolished so you can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aren’t you too arrogant? Boss Mo, let’s show him some colour in revenge for Scar.” One of the goons furiously yelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Dong took a step back and waved his hand, commanding his goons to splash the wall of the Three Flavour Hall, instantly covering the wall in paint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A construction worker couldn’t bear this scene and wanted to obstruct them, but he suffered a kick to his head, resulting in a scrape wound on his forehead with blood flowing out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck, those who dare to interfere will die!” The goon roared arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knitted his brows as he entered the pharmacy and walked out with gauze, ethanol and sterilized cotton to dress the wound of that construction worker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t agree to it, then I’ll burn your entire house!” The goon that yelled earlier lifted a bucket with ‘gasoline’ written on it and saw that Su Tao wasn’t willing to budge. It was a usual routine, commonly used to force others to comply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He splashed the gasoline directly on the wall, and the spectators immediately moved back with shock written on their faces at this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan had also heard the commotion, so he rushed over from the antique shop and whispered to Su Tao. “Should I call the police?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed and bitterly smiled at her suggestion. “You can give it a try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan immediately took her phone from her pocket and dialled for police which Mo Dong and his group sneered upon seeing her action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The phone rang for some time, but the other party did not pick up, which left Cai Yan furious. “They really have no regards for the law!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao bitterly smiled. “They must have already made preparations so the police will not be here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan immediately felt indignant. “Officials and commerce colluding, simply a rotten nest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao still maintained his composure, Mo Dong sighed before he stretched out his finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of his men took out a lighter, lighting up a cigarette and threatened, “I’ll give you another chance. If you’re still stubborn, then we’ll burn it and leave you with nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao took two steps forth. The Three Flavour Hall was left to him by his grandfather, so he couldn’t let those assholes burn it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was about to make a move, a commercial black Buick GL8 drove over and stopped at the doors of the Three Flavour Hall. A western lady with a breathtaking height came out of the car.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She took her sunglasses off her oval face, revealing her pale-white skin, sun-kissed blonde hair and heels, which factored into her height. She glanced at Mo Dong’s party before smiling at Su Tao. “Tao, seems like I have come at the wrong timing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera’s sudden arrival surprised Su Tao. How did she manage to get discharged even before her illness stabilised?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan glanced at Su Tao with a complex gaze, since she never thought that he would have a foreign friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera walked towards Su Tao, smiling as she waved the name card in her hand. “I was prepared to come and take a look at your pharmacy. Looks like you’ve encountered some trouble, do you need my help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao shrugged. “If you can deal with this, then… I’ll treat you to a meal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Vera really be concerned with a treat? However, her cheeks stretched, which revealed a smirk. “You better keep your promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Russian chick that knew mandarin and was well-versed with idioms. She wouldn’t really have fallen for him, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera was filled with gratitude for Su Tao. So if she could help Su Tao, it would be considered as paying him back. Vera already had Secretary Li make a check to Su Tao and knew that he had encountered problems with the forced demolition of his pharmacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it’s a demolition, then it must be related to money. In her eyes, anything that could be solved using money wasn’t a problem for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She waved her hand, signalling Secretary Li, which he nodded and went before Mo Dong and asked, “How much money do you need? Open a price!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Open your mother!” A goon landed a front kick on Secretary Li’s stomach, causing Secretary Li to hold onto his stomach as he took several steps back. He fell onto the ground with disbelief flashing in his eyes before returning with his tail between his legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera was genuinely startled by this event. “They’re not reasonable at all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had already expected this outcome. He showed a helpless smile. “In Russia, would those triads be reasonable with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Barbie doll Vera’s eyes gushed with flames. If this was in Russia, then she would have long used her connections to get rid of these hoodlums.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sadly, she’s currently in China and aside from money, there weren’t any resources she could deploy. Seeing her awkward expression, Su Tao moved and positioned himself before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Dong was extremely satisfied with how his goon trashed Secretary Li and clapped his hand. Immediately, a group of men waved their tools and charged forth, surrounding Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Dong heard that Su Tao had some martial arts background, so he wanted to send his subordinates to test the water before making a move himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao did not cower from those men, he went up instead. Silhouettes flashed, which left those men in puzzlement. Some of them felt their wrists turning numb or their flanks sore. They couldn’t even take a glimpse at Su Tao’s figure before all of them lost control of their bodies as they fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow, if this video goes online, it will definitely be viral! It’s even more exciting than an action movie!” A youth was secretly recording a video on how Su Tao trashed those men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The smile on Mo Dong’s face froze before his expression turned a little ugly. Despite his martial arts background and experience, he couldn’t recognize Su Tao’s movements. Su Tao was swift and every single attack was fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera was stunned as she looked at Su Tao. She never imagined that he would have such outstanding martial abilities aside from his medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Cai Yan pulsed her lips as she occasionally nodded her head. It’s as if she had expected this from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Dong knew that it was impossible for him to stop Su Tao with his goons alone. Thus, he removed his gown with a sneer, revealing a singlet and his bulging muscles and veins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he handed the asses of those goons to them, Su Tao looked at Mo Dong as he removed his gown and knitted his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s just a fight, why would you even have to remove your clothes? Would removing your clothes make you more powerful? What a retard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them moved closer, testing the other to move first. Despite his weak and feeble figure, Su Tao stood as firm as a boulder, while Mo Dong, who was in the Wingchun horse stance, took two several steps back from the clash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wingchun horse stance was the foundation of Wingchun and at the highest level, it was even a hundred times sturdier than an ordinary horse stance. Back when Yan Wingchun got married, she relied on this stance to keep her husband from taking her virginity on the night of their marriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Dong already knew that he had no chance when the stance, which he had practised for ten years, was broken in a single move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Mo Dong was about to retreat, Su Tao had mysteriously appeared before him and he gently knocked onto Mo Dong’s arm, causing Mo Dong to lose his balance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of instinct, he executed the inch-punch while unleashing a high kick. However, he was jabbed by Su Tao’s finger on his underarm, which resulted in him falling onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao pursued, stomping Mo Dong’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just barely ten minutes, everyone was on the floor, aside from Su Tao, without a shred of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell your boss that I will not give up on the Three Flavour Hall no matter what compensation he offers.” Su Tao withdrew his foot, leaving a shoe mark on Mo Dong’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao walked back to the gate, looking almighty with absolute confidence and unswerving determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Vera and Cai Yan included, many girls were looking at him in a daze, while the guys sighed in their hearts. In contrast to Su Tao’s appearance, he was a hot-blooded man deep in his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sirens suddenly rang out as a police car arrived with a slightly plump team leader. He looked at the mess on the ground and knitted his brows. “We have received a report of an unlawful brawl taking place. Please cooperate with our investigation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unlawful brawl? They’re trying to forcefully demolish the shop of others!” There were some in the group that expressed their unhappiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The policeman waved his hand that held a baton, dispersing the crowd before walking towards Su Tao and pointed his baton towards Su Tao’s nose, “You’re the man of the Three Flavour Hall, right? You’re suspected to be involved in this incident, so I’ll have to trouble you to come along with us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao turned his head, to see the baton that nearly smashed his head. Su Tao furrowed his brows and seized the police baton with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How gutsy, you actually dare to resist arrest!” The team leader raged, executing a low kick towards Su Tao’s flank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Su Tao gently shifted his position and his finger jabbed the lower abdomen of the policeman. Instantly, the team leader felt his entire body becoming numb as he laid on the ground like soft cotton.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The policeman held onto his stomach as he yelled towards his colleagues, “This brat assaulted a public servant! Don’t just stand there, cuff him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not dare get up again, fearing that he would embarrass himself even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unlawful brawl, resisting arrest and assaulting a public servant!” Those weren’t small offences as the policemen all came up with cuffs in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan was extremely anxious when she saw that Su Tao was going to get arrested, as she whispered into the ear of an old man. Grandpa Xu was an old man that manned the papercutting store and he had some prestige in the area. He immediately walked up and defended Su Tao, stopping the policemen. “You people cannot take him away in this manner. You cannot be confused with right and wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Grandpa Xu had stepped forth, the neighbours all walked up, surrounding the police car. At this moment, the team leader had already stood up from the ground and knitted his brows. “You guys want to assault public servants? Do you want me to bring all of you back to the police station?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was a little touched by this scene. Ever since he returned to the Three Flavour Hall, he did not interact much with his neighbours; but even so, they were so passionate about defending him. He sighed, “I will follow them to the police station. Thanks for worrying about me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandpa Xu answered, “We’re all neighbours and this street is very old. All of us have feelings for it and no one can demolish it. We can’t push the responsibility to you alone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, that’s right!” The other neighbours hooted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao gently pushed Grandpa Xu away and faintly said, “Rest assured. I’m only going to the police station to have my statement recorded and I will be back swiftly. I’d have to trouble Grandpa Xu to look after my shop while I’m gone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nie Weiting must have pulled all the relevant department in the background with the objective of catching him. If the neighbours obstructed the police from executing their duty, then it would just blow up the battle and give the other party more excuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A policeman walked up and placed the cuffs on Su Tao’s wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao shook his arm which nearly caused the policeman to lose his balance as he smiled. “Aren’t we going to the station? I can walk myself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grandpa Xu was stunned at Su Tao’s actions as he watched Su Tao enter the police car and helplessly said to Cai Yan. “That child does have the bearing of Old Su.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan’s gaze flashed with worry in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao, however, was calm and composed, since he had long guessed that Nie Weiting had set up a chain of plans for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first plan was Su Tao being dealt with my his men; the other one would be Su Tao being arrested for investigation by the police.</span></p>
