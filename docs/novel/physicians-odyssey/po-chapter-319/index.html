 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By resorting a psychological tactic, it indirectly proved that Su Tao was respectful of Kim Jung-ho’s ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through special channels, Liu Ruochen managed to obtain information on Kim Jung-ho. The latter has treated 3,500 patients, and he used a different treatment for every single one of them. He has already exceeded the fundamentals of TCM ⁠— Seeking Literature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeking literature meant the search for treatments through medical books.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that was unreasonable, since everyone has their own character. Despite sharing similar symptoms, the patient’s lifestyle and constitution weren’t the same. So even in the treatment, different portions of herbs were used, despite having a similar prescription. So seeking medical books wasn’t reliable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho sought breakthroughs by creating new techniques from the foundation of seeking literature. He would come up with different prescriptions for every patient, which allowed them to recover faster than usual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His family had a deep foundation and kept many ancient medical books. When he was three, he was forced to memorise them. Although his pronunciation of Mandarin was somewhat awkward, his study in the language wasn’t inferior to any language professor at Seoul’s university. That’s because he knew that if he wanted to obtain a breakthrough and surpass his grandfather, he had to research in the origin of TKM ⁠— TCM.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he stepped into the hall, his hands were burning from his excitement. It was something that he never felt in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he was feeling excited because he finally found an evenly matched rival. Even Wang Guofeng did not make him feel this way, since the latter was too steady and he’s still stuck at the level of seeking literature. He has yet to discover his own special trait from those books.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using martial arts as an example, Wang Guofeng was akin to have cultivated a martial art to the pinnacle and was familiar with the moves. But he has yet to achieve the level of simplifying the techniques and finding his own style.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Kim Jung-ho and Su Tao had medical knowledge engraved in their hearts, and they would put themselves in the shoes of their predecessors to ponder and create their own path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At best, Wang Guofeng could only be considered as a master, while Kim Jung-ho and Su Tao had stepped into the threshold of grandmasters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference between a master and grandmaster was akin to the comparison between Tang Nanzheng with Song Sichen and Dou Fanggang. While Tang Nanzheng’s fame was only restricted within Hanzhou City, Old Song and Old Dou’s reputations were spread throughout the country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Kim Jung-ho’s view, Wang Guofeng’s fame was largely due to his background with the support of two grandmasters; his grandfather and father. But in terms of medical skills, Wang Guofeng was nothing compared to Kim Jung-ho.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wang Guofeng’s gaze fell onto Su Tao, his heart was swept up in a turmoil of jealousy, despite maintaining his composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He always asked himself a question in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What gives Su Tao the right to be the focus of attention in the International Medical Summit?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Murong Hong glanced at Wang Guofeng’s trembling hands, he inwardly sighed. He could imagine what was going through the latter’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he let out a sigh, “Guofeng, you have to be prepared. If Su Tao loses, then you have to go up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go up?” Wang Guofeng was shocked as he looked at Murong Hong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah.” Murong Hong’s expression turned grave as he continued, “The honor of TCM cannot be discredited. If Su Tao is defeated, then you will challenge Kim Jung-ho and retrieve our honor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And if he wins?” Wang Guofeng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good if he wins.” Murong Hong spoke rationally. “Remember, we’re now abroad, and we have to put our differences aside to unite together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng’s lips subconsciously raised, feeling disdain for Murong Hong’s conception. Why should he clean up Su Tao’s mess?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? You’re not willing?” Murong Hong’s gaze was sharp as he pierced through Wang Guofeng’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Regardless of the outcome, I will not make a move!” Wang Guofeng replied. “Senior Murong, please forgive me, but I have my own pride.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Wang Guofeng’s reply, Murong Hong weakly sighed. He knew that this wasn’t fair to Wang Guofeng, and if Su Tao lost, Wang Guofeng had to assume risks, even if he&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">was</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;willing to challenge KimJung-ho. After all, Wang Guofeng has lost to Kim Jung-ho in the past, and it would be a significant blow to Wang Guofeng’s mentality if he lost again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Locking his brows together, Murong Hong couldn’t find a better candidate. Could it be that he can only place all his hopes on Su Tao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Can he undertake the task?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The International Medical Summit has begun. It was sponsored by famous medical apparatus enterprises in the world with huge episodes of advertisement. Western medicine was having increasingly higher demands for their equipment, especially when it came to detection apparatuses. It maintained a renewal speed of three years, which meant that within an average of five years, a hospital would fork out funds to upgrade their apparatuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The costs of those apparatuses fell on the patients. Perhaps some machinery might only cost a few hundred US dollars to manufacture, but it was drastically increased when they sold it. Medical apparatuses was an industry with high profits, but it’s also related to the industry itself. In the world, health was of utmost importance. For treatment, patients were even willing to fork out their wealth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to Western Medicine, TCM did not have that many demands. Veteran physicians only had to take the pulse of their patients to determine their illnesses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such a low cost and charging inexpensive fees, it directly affected the survivability of TCM. Without any business elements in it, the advertisements would also be lacking. Hence, common folks had more trust in Western Medicine and were skeptical about TCM.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The issue in TCM wasn’t the medical knowledge, but the lack of business opportunity in this industry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Kim Jung-ho has done was pretty good. He managed to modernise traditional things and advertised them through his own methods, which allowed TKM to receive more attention in South Korea. At the same time, more people were willing to accept TKM and receive treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking a myriad of miles is better than reading a myriad of books.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao has learned many things on this trip to South Korea, and he vaguely found a way to develop the Three Flavour Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t someone with ambition, but he was moving towards a goal. As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve never seen you so serious.” Liu Ruochen smiled, hoping to alleviate Su Tao’s stress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t help it. I have to admit that Kim Jung-ho is the strongest opponent that I’ve encountered by far.” Su Tao frankly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have always been confident, and I believe Kim Jung-ho will be shocked if he hears your evaluation of him.” Liu Ruochen subconsciously glanced at Kim Jung-ho, which the latter also wore a grave expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, you’ve misunderstood what I’ve said!” Su Tao shook his head and interrupted Liu Ruochen’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Misunderstood?” Liu Ruochen was perplexed as she looked at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah. I'm not serious because I’m not confident in beating him, but I’m considering how to defeat him wholeheartedly.” Su Tao replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arrogant!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;But at the same time, he was qualified to be arrogant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Liu Ruochen smiled. “Then I can only wish Kim Jung-ho luck. Let’s hope that he won’t lose too badly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He shouldn’t. After all, he’s more capable than Wang Guofeng.” Su Tao tried to probe Liu Ruochen by mentioning her former fiancé on purpose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile on her lips, how could Liu Ruochen fail to see through Su Tao’s intentions? Sweeping her fringe with her finger, she said, “If you’re always using Wang Guofeng as the measuring tape, then your vision is too narrow.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing her words, Su Tao no longer spoke about Wang Guofeng. Although it was somewhat immoral to speak badly of others, Su Tao wasn’t a gentleman, to begin with. Not to mention that Wang Guofeng has been playing tricks in the background, so Su Tao couldn’t be bothered about being a gentleman with his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s a close relationship between Su Tao and Liu Ruochen. Although it was partly because Liu Ruochen was attracted to him, he has also been giving out all sorts of hints and temptations in the process. In the end, he was doing this to spite Wang Guofeng.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weren’t you challenging me time and time again? Then I’ll woo your fiancée and disgust you!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Medicine Deity Corporation that Wang Guofeng and Bai Fan established was blindly following the Three Flavour Hall and plagiarising them. Furthermore, they even set traps for the Three Flavour Hall several times. When the time comes, he will certainly settle that debt with Wang Guofeng and Bai Fan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Data smart treatment was the main topic for this International Medical Summit, as many specialists in the field gave a speech. Su Tao was patiently sitting down as he listened. Although it wasn’t directly related to TCM, he still gained some comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nowadays, many industries were going into data strategy. If there was a giant network that categorised all the cases of TCM into a data bank, it could achieve having countless specialists online at the same time to give a consultation. It was also beneficial for practical application and generalising TCM.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had a strong acceptance of new stuff. He even had many applications installed on his phone. If consultation can be done through phones, then wouldn’t it be more efficient?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">TCM emphasised on Inspection, Listening &amp; Smelling, Inquiring, and Palpation. But for ordinary illnesses, an inspection was sufficient. So if he could input it into an application, physicians could see their patients through the network and engage their consultation. This was definitely an effective method to cut down on the cost of treatment for patients.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With an idea finalising in his mind, Su Tao felt that he could give it a try when he returned to China. Application technology has already matured, and it wouldn’t cost much to invest. As for advertisements, he can launch a joint advertisement with the Three Flavour Cosmetics International and Three Flavour Hall. He might be able to create a 020 model!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the procedures were completed, the table was removed from the stage and the organising committee started shifting things. A brief moment later, it had formed into two individual consultation rooms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The host announced in English, “We will now begin our main event. We will have a mutual learning session between South Korea’s Kim Jung-ho and China’s Su Tao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have already selected our judges, and we have arranged two patients with similar illnesses. Whoever can treat his patient fastest will be the winner!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although it might be a mutual learning session, the two contestants made a private bet amongst themselves. The loser will have to take on the winner’s signboard on his medical center or pharmacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, let us invite the two contestants to the stage!”</span></p>
