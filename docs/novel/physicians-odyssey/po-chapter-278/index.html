 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At 5 a.m., Shui Junzhuo and company finally arrived at the third prison after the tenacious journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Lin Fangbin glanced at Shui Junzhuo, her face was pale, but her eyes were bright. Evidently, she was relying on her mentality to support herself at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing that authoritative figures were coming for a visit, there was a team gathered in the prison and they bowed after seeing Lin Fangbin and Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leader of that group was a man with a medium build, and his name was Hou Liang. He went up to receive Lin Fangbin with a fawning smile, “I welcome for an inspection!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waving his hand, Lin Fangbin said, “I’ve already given my instructions through the phone. I’m not here for an inspection, but to pick someone up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words immediately made Hou Liang nod his head. “I understand. But it’s a little difficult since he isn’t willing to come out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Fangbin was briefly stunned before he glanced at Shui Junzhuo, which the latter asked, “Did you guys use violence on him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way!” Hou Liang bitterly smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It will be fortunate if Su Tao doesn’t use violence against others!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those inmates were yearning for Su Tao to leave. One of them suffered a broken rib while the other one sustained acute gastroenteritis and was still under emergency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking that the prison was just finding an excuse, Shui Junzhuo said, “We’ll go pick him up if he’s not willing to come out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she walked through the hallway, Shui Junzhuo’s heart went cold. She couldn’t imagine anyone spending a night in this terrible environment. When they came to the cell, a prison officer immediately opened the gate, and the scene inside left her shocked. The inmates had formed a circle with their hands on each other’s shoulders. It was as if they were cultivating some evil art.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was an exception. A person was lying on the bed, lying on his side, sleeping sweetly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao, I’m here to pick you up.” Shui Junzhuo cleared her throat and called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had a feeling that Su Tao had been waiting for her arrival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Opening his eyes, Su Tao stretched his waist and got down the bed with a smile while rubbing his eyes. “You’re pretty early!” He wasn’t pretending to be asleep, but was swept by fatigue half an hour ago while counting. Hence, he got the inmates to form a circle with their arms around each other and fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo replied, “Can’t help it. I was worried that something might have happened to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing around, Su Tao smiled. “Don’t worry. I’m pretty lucky that these inmates were friendly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words instantly made all the prison officers’ expressions turn ugly. Those inmates all had bruises and welts on their faces, they were clearly beaten up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Shui Junzhuo felt a little amused by this scene. But perhaps it was the change in her mood after seeing that Su Tao was fine. “Let’s go. Regardless of anything, this is still a prison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Draping his coat over his shoulders, Su Tao smiled. “Let’s go, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo had personally come fetch him, so how could he put on airs?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he refused the offer to move to the office from that prison officer from before was so that he wouldn’t feel guilty when Shui Junzhuo came to fetch him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, how would she feel if she saw him lying on the bed sleeping when she came all the way over?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he needed a touching scene for the beauty to save the hero. Although those inmates had been beaten up by him, the environment in the cell was still impactful. Thus, Shui Junzhuo would feel that her journey was all worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you do to them?” Shui Junzhuo asked after hearing the cheers coming from the cell when Su Tao left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nothing much, I just got them to do push-ups for a night.” Su Tao answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did you manage to do that?” For some reason, Shui Junzhuo had chosen to believe in Su Tao’s ridiculous answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Using reasons to convince them, naturally!” This time, Su Tao did not tell the truth. If he told her that he resorted to violence, he would probably scare the chick. “I’ve exhausted a great deal of saliva to touch them with reason. This is also the reason why they did push-ups for an entire night.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words teased Shui Junzhuo into laughing. But recalling that Lin Fangbin was still around, she immediately held her laughter, making her pent-up expression look adorable. “Oh, right, let me introduce you. This is Big Brother Lin Fangbin, and he is the reason why you got free so smoothly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Lin Fangbin already knew everything that occurred in the cell and felt that Su Tao was a talent. It was no wonder why the Shui Family would place such importance in him. Not to mention that Shui Junzhuo seemed to have some feelings for this kid, so he was more than happy to form a good relationship with Su Tao. “It’s nothing. I’ve also heard that you punished the evildoers and fixed a few tyrants in prison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a modest smile, Su Tao responded, “It’s nothing much. If you don’t show some skills in prison, you will only be trampled upon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Lin Fangbin asked with interest, “I heard that you’re a doctor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, a physician!” Su Tao replied. Through their simple conversation, he had gained an initial understanding of Lin Fangbin. Despite coming from an influential family without any worries growing up, he was well-educated and had a brief stay in Europe. Although he had never experienced any military training, his physique wasn’t inferior to an elite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Fangbin smiled. “It’s rare to see a physician as young as yourself. This is not an easy career to stand out in.” Because he has lived overseas, he was naturally more inclined towards western medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Every career has its own difficulties. I believe that TCM will slowly change the view of others.” Su Tao responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Fangbin wasn’t unhappy with Su Tao’s rebuke, instead he felt that Su Tao was an interesting person. Seeing the qualities in others was the foundation of an outstanding person, and it was a skill set that everyone from an influential family had to learn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His previous words were meant to probe Su Tao, and just as he had expected, Su Tao wasn’t simple. It’s no wonder why Sire Shui would personally make a call to his grandfather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Brother Fangbin, this matter still hasn’t been resolved, even if Su Tao is fine. I hope that you can help me handle this matter appropriately.” Shui Junzhuo suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, there was a chill flickering in his eyes as Lin Fangbin replied, “Junzuo, don’t worry about it. Since that foreigner isn’t a good person, I will definitely make him taste some suffering. As for those people related to him, I will also deal with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.” Shui Junzhuo was grateful from the bottom of her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a faint smile, Lin Fangbin responded, “But Hans has some relations in the north, and it might be a little troublesome in the process.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hand him to my Shui Family. My grandfather has already made a decision.” Shui Junzhuo smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Talking to Shui Junzhuo was truly easy. Lin Fangbin smiled. “We’ll arrange it that way, then. I’ll send Hans to Huainan Province after capturing him for you guys to deal with him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are you going now?” Shui Junzhuo suddenly stopped and turned to look at Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene had stunned Lin Fangbin, and he even wanted to curse. Was Su Tao a great philanthropist in his previous life? The princess of the Shui Family practically only had him in her eyes, and it made Lin Fangbin jealous to the point that he wanted to rip his hair out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My mobile phone was seized, so I have to make a trip back to Baitan Town to get it back.” Su Tao replied after a brief pondering before continuing, “Furthermore, I still have things to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go with you, then!” Shui Junzhuo lowered her head and said with a blissfulness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a smart person, he could feel Shui Junzhuo’s feelings for him even if he was blind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he felt a little guilty in his heart. After all, there were many seeds planted in his heart, and the number of relationship debts he had would increase with Shui Junzhuo included.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hans was currently having his beauty sleep in a four-star hotel’s deluxe room in Zhanxiang County. He had a strange dream. His head was covered in needles by Su Tao, like a hedgehog. Thus, he was shocked awake and felt that his throat was dry. He was even suspecting whether he had sequelae from Su Tao’s jab.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like most foreigners who did not have a habit of drinking water, Hans took some tap water from the bathroom to moist his mouth. He was struck with a chill from the water, driving his sleepiness away. However, there was still a peculiar taste in his mouth caused by the trauma of pig shit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, his mobile phone suddenly rang. When he walked over, he noticed that it was from Rangure, and he nudged his hard rod. His body wouldn’t lie, and it was his dream to get Rangure in bed with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My dearest Rangure, are there any instructions?” Hans teased in German.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hans, where are you right now?” On the other side, Rangure’s voice was unusually stern, leaving Hans somewhat surprised. In his impression, Rangure was a flirtatious woman, and she wouldn’t mind his occasional teases.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m in a small county in Sichuan Province.” Hans smiled as he continued, “The scenery here is superb, and the air is especially fresh. I had enough of Yunhai’s terrible air.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Rangure wasn’t in the mood to chat with Hans and instructed, “I’ve just received news that you’re a target now. Take Plan B now and leave China for Germany immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mhm?” Hans was perplexed by her sudden orders, so he asked, “Am I hearing you, right? You want me to return to Germany?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suppressing her temper, Rangure replied, “I’m solemnly telling you now that you’re a target of some powers in China. Leave immediately if you don’t want to die. If you act now, you might be able to save your life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words instantly made Hans nervous. He knew the consequences if his deeds and identity were exposed. No one would show sympathy for a foreign spy, and even if he has received training before he was despatched, China was well-known for their inhumane interrogation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can I ask where the problem arose?” asked Hans with his voice lowered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tao, that young physician from Hanzhou!” Rangure sighed as she continued, “We’ve underestimated his influence!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hans knew that Rangure wasn’t joking around, so he immediately hung up the phone and packed his luggage in a rush. He had even left behind his expensive watch by the basin from the haste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly half an hour after Hans left, two black bullet-proof vehicles arrived with soldiers armed to the teeth. They stormed the hotel. They had studied the blueprints before their arrival, so two soldiers were left to guard the lift while the rest climbed the stairs to Hans and the mercenaries’ rooms. In just around a dozen minutes, they already stormed into Hans and the mercenaries’ rooms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Report, the mission failed. The primary target escaped, only the secondary targets have been captured.” The captain pointed his gun at the mercenary as he made a report.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Expand the search radius, and he must be captured. That person is extremely dangerous. Have the police force in the province cooperate with the search. That person has to be found as soon as possible, and deadly force is approved.” A man gave out an order from the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roger!” The captain stored his communication device and immediately gave orders to spread a net throughout Sichuan Province to launch a manhunt.</span></p>
