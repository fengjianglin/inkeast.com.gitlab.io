 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Dou has been receiving consultations for the past five to six hours, and he only ate a box meal with us. Does he need to rest?” Cai Yan was concerned. She wanted Dou Fanggang to take a rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. Senior Dou’s in his best state.” Su Tao glanced at Dou Fanggang. The latter’s complexion was rosy with bright eyes and his body was in an excited state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Receiving the assurance from Su Tao, Cai Yan felt relieved. Su Tao was also a doctor, and he would surely be able to tell if Dou Fanggang was exhausted. Letting out a sigh, she replied, “It’s all thanks to Senior Dou being here that the entire situation was turned around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao knew that Dou Fanggang was the protagonist today. Even he has learned quite a few things from the latter. In terms of eyesight, Song Sichen was undisputed. But in terms of practical combat, Dou Fanggang was a level higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Patients were coming in endlessly, mainly due to Dou Fanggang’s medical skills and his ample experience. He has relied on his own medical skills to win over their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite working for a few hours, Dou Fanggang still remained calm and tranquil. It was unimaginable how anyone with such a violent temper could be so calm and composed at work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a physician, his style would infect his patients. It was as if any illness wasn’t a challenge in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Attitude determines everything, and when patients are relaxed, they would not have any rejection for the treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the future, I plan to have a powerful physician for every new outlet.” Su Tao decided to share his idea with Cai Yan before he continued, “I’ve already made contact with Aqua Cloud Stream, and they will be delivering TCM talents to me. Even Song Sichen and Dou Fanggang will be sending their disciples to the Three Flavour Hall. As for the Medical Dao Sect and Great Compassion Gate, I will try and contact them to absorb more talents.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his idea, Cai Yan praised, “Your idea is pretty good, and it’s innovative compared to the other pharmacies. Others are mainly selling herbs, but you’re trying to promote medical consultation services and take the initiative to make a change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few seconds of silence, Su Tao responded, “I can tell that the Medicine King Hall is also trying to pick up this method of operation, but they’re too anxious about their profits. Although they invited Duanmu Qing at a high cost for this event, they created an incident in terms of their prescription. Although the patients are not spending any money to have their illness treated, they are required to spend it on herbs. This method will only cause the locals to be disappointed and affect the development of TCM.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The price of TCM herbs was also being hyped over the past two years. Some herbal merchants packaged themselves as TCM specialists to promote the concept of nurturing the body such as ‘Mung Beans are guaranteed to cure all diseases’, ‘Dendrobium Officinale can nourish the stomach,’ or ‘Caterpillar Fungus can strengthen the body and nourish the kidney.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, every TCM herb had a limit to their effects, and they could only show their full potential by mixing together with other herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Take the Caterpillar Fungus as an example. It was often used as a catalyst for the treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, what are you planning?” At this moment, Cai Yan found Su Tao extremely charismatic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The profit system of the Three Flavour Hall lies in TCM’s talents.” Su Tao smiled as he continued, “On the other hand, we will lower our profits in our medicine so that we can compete with Western Medicine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing his concept, Cai Yan commented, “You’ve thought deep into it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had been pondering the difference between TCM and Western Medicine. Although ordinary folks were complaining about the medical bill for Western Medicine, TCM’s herbs were way more expensive in their costs. The reason why there wasn’t any reaction from the market was due to the lack of the generalisation of TCM. After it’s generalised, TCM would have to compete with Western Medicine in terms of their herbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two of them discussed, a man walked in. He wore a spectacle and carried a camera bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan swiftly reacted. She went up and smiled. “I’m sorry, but no photos are allowed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man appeared to be in his early thirties. As he rustled through his pocket, he retrieved a name card. “Nice to meet you. I’m a reporter for Huaibei Daily, and the reason for my visit is due to a source that I received.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What would you like to know?” Cai Yan smiled. With her excellent features and figure, she had a good image, and any man would have their heart racing when they look at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the man examined Cai Yan, he swept his gaze over the hall with an awkward smile. “I’ll not beat around the bush. Someone complained that there was violence used here during your grand opening.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Indeed, something like that did happen, but it has already been resolved.” Cai Yan smiled as she pointed at the guest area in the hall. “If possible, I would like to explain to you the entire matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This reporter came intending to get a piece of negative news, but not everyone could cooperate for news of this nature. He was initially pondering about how he should draft his article to make the news feasible. Because he had to gather news for another article, the conflict was already over by the time he arrived, which increased the difficulty of gathering the news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when he saw Cai Yan, he was instantly captivated by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Cai Yan truthfully explained the entire dispute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the reporter heard that, he furiously slammed his hand on the desk. “So that’s the case! If I heard the other party’s one-sided words, then I would surely be misguided!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing his response, Cai Yan immediately rejoiced. She could tell that this reporter had ethics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reporters are ever-changing, and when this reporter noticed that it was too difficult to continue with this negative news, he started to change his angle and started from the expansion of the Three Flavour Hall. Thus, he interviewed Cai Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eloquently, Cai Yan introduced the Three Flavour Hall’s background to the reporter and even emphasised about the person-in-charge, Su Tao. When the reporter heard that Su Tao was only in his twenties, his interest was immediately piqued. For many people, TCM was a blindspot. So even if Su Tao has obtained an achievement from South Korea, not many people would know about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since this reporter has been following up on the medical industry for a long time, he instantly had an impression half-way through the interview and commented, “So the person-in-charge of the Three Flavour Hall is the victor of last year’s Physician King Tournament.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah. Because He City is the medicine capital, we planned to locate our first branch here.” Cai Yan replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now, I’ve finally grasped the news factor!” The reporter was excited as he continued, “You don’t mind if I include the entire story today in my article, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure!” Cai Yan continued, “You’re providing a free advertisement for us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, the reporter replied, “Then I’ll end my interview here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pursing her lips, Cai Yan shoved an envelope into the hands of the reporter. “Thanks for your work!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reporter was briefly stunned, but he did not reject and stowed the envelope into his pocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the reporter received the envelope, it would state his position. Tomorrow, the news would be standing on the Three Flavour Hall’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan was well-trained in receiving guests and she even had a talent in this factor. After all, her girl-next-door temperament would make others feel close to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the reporter left, Cai Yan came to Su Tao’s side and smiled. “Why does there seem to be something unusual about your gaze?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was charmed by you!” Su Tao bowed with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s enough. You men are always like that, and it’s easy for you guys to be charmed by a woman’s appearance.” Cai Yan narrowed her eyes as she looked at Su Tao. However, she was feeling sweet in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m speaking the truth from my heart.” Letting out a sigh, Su Tao continued, “That reporter was clearly seeking trouble, but you managed to change his mindset with your public relations skills. You’ve done a great job!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao was feeling especially happy. Not only because this matter was resolved, but also because he no longer felt lonely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Recalling his experience for the past ten years, he was mostly fighting by himself. But at this moment, he noticed that a group of people surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His dream was indirectly connected to the dream of many people, and when he faced a predicament, he was no longer alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan has undergone a significant change. She was no longer that girl-next-door who eats melon seed by the Emerald Jade Brook’s door. At this moment, she already possessed the shadow of an able woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans will slowly change, but Cai Yan’s growth has exceeded Su Tao’s expectations. At this moment, he was even a little hopeful about how Cai Yan would bloom like a rose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wearing a leather jacket, Luo Ran stood by the door of the Three Flavour Hall with a cigarette hanging on his lips. After spitting the cigarette butt onto the floor, he stomped on it and extinguished the flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this moment, Zhao Jian charged over. He recognised this uninvited guest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not welcomed here!” Zhao Jian bellowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not qualified to talk to me.” Luo Ran flung his lips in disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, Zhao Jian felt a breeze on his back and Xia Yu stepped forth, grabbing onto Luo Ran’s neck. Relying on the momentum, he dragged Luo Ran out of the door before he released his grip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Ran felt as if his throat was burning, so he subconsciously grabbed onto his throat and retched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re not welcome here!” As Xia Yu spoke in a solemn voice, he continued, “Remember, do not enter the Three Flavour Hall as you want in the future!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took a long time for Luo Ran to recover, then he immediately took two steps back to establish a safe distance before looking at Xia Yu with fear and said in a hoarse voice, “I was under Senior Brother Bai’s orders to invite Divine Physician Su!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” With a cold sneer, Xia Yu asked, “A banquet to murder?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What, he’s afraid?” Luo Ran tried to launch a psychological attack, but he was clearly still afraid of Xia Yu. This man who had a fiery temper was too rough with his actions and even had excellent skills. He did not want to get beaten up twice in a row!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Afraid?” Xia Yu burst into laughter as he continued, “You’re too childish. Have you been watching too many dramas?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“7 p.m. at the Intoxicated Countryside Pavilion’s private room!” Luo Ran glanced at the young man standing inside before he left with his tail between his legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He initially wanted to proudly inform the other party, but he never expected that he would be thrown out. Hence, anyone could imagine the turmoil in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bai Fan must have ill intentions to meet up with you. I suggest you don’t keep the appointment.” Xia Yu cautiously said as he came to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ill intentions? So what? Would I be afraid of him eating me?” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Xia Yu knew Su Tao’s character well. Despite the latter’s warming appearance, he was actually a stubborn fellow and wouldn’t bow his head so easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we want to gain a footing in He City, then we can’t show any weakness!” Su Tao continued, “I’m also curious as to what kind of plan awaits me at this banquet of Bai Fan’s.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go with you!” Xia Yu sounded his concern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need!” Su Tao patiently persuaded, “You have to stay in the Three Flavour Hall. I’m afraid that it might be a plan to lure me away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yu nodded his head. The Three Flavour Hall would be vulnerable if he left as well. With Bai Fan’s style, there was a high possibility for the latter to send someone over and trash the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, he had trust in Su Tao. Since Su Tao dared to visit the tiger’s den, he must surely have a plan to escape unscathed.</span></p>
