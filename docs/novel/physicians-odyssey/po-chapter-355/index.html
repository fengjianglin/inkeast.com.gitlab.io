 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a master in martial arts, but he never had one in his medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since he was guided into the TCM industry, he has relied on himself to polish his medical skills and absorbed the essence of various ancient books. Hence, not many people could tell the origin of his skills from his technique. Su Tao has learned too many things, which was especially after he learned the Heavenseizing Hands. His medical skills alone have formed into a school of its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he kneeled before Dou Fanggang since this was the first person who taught him a practically monstrous skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bian Que Hands had a total of thirty-six techniques, with nine variations for each technique. It has accumulated the experience of countless predecessors. This was a mature, effective, and complicated massage technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it was too complicated, there was practically no successor, and it was on the edge of going extinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dou Fanggang was a talented physician, and he has spent over a decade to learn the Bian Que Hands. But despite his many disciples, there wasn’t anyone who managed to learn the Bian Que Hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I initially intended to pass you this medical skill that was passed down by my ancestors after you date my granddaughter. But right now, I’ve thought it all through. I can’t be selfish if I want TCM to develop.” Dou Fanggang was gratified as he supported Su Tao. “You did not disappoint me! You managed to learn the Bian Que Hands within three days, and even I am blushing with shame. I dare not be your master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dou Fanggang was someone concerned with his face, and he only said it to have a way out of an embarrassing situation. If Su Tao really did not want to take him as a master, the former would definitely go insane with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao had a persevering side to his character, but he wasn’t an arrogant person. Hence, he immediately smiled. “It’s my honor instead to be your disciple. Please be reassured. I will make sure the Bian Que Hands is not lost.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head in satisfaction, Dou Fanggang sighed, “It’s enough with your words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he finished, he took out his phone and made a call as he smiled, “Old Song, how are you recently?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was baffled as he looked at Dou Fanggang. But he soon recovered from it, Dou Fanggang was calling Song Sichen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My old bones are still working fine!” Song Sichen smiled as he asked, “How is your charity consultation going?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You did it for three days back then, right? I lasted one day more than you!” Dou Fanggang was pleased as he added, “Furthermore, I have to share a piece of good news with you. I just accepted Little Su as my inner disciple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” When Song Sichen heard Dou Fanggang’s words, he instantly lost his composure and became flustered. Grabbing ahold of the phone, his eyes widened as he raged, “You old sly bone! You actually made the first move?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I’ll be hanging up the call!” Dou Fanggang did not wait for Song Sichen’s reply and immediately hung up the call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing to the side, Su Tao was dumbfounded, but he knew that Dou Fanggang was making use of him to boast to Song Sichen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Dou Fanggang shook his head, he said, “Little Su, you have to promise me something!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please, speak your mind.” In his heart, Su Tao was teased by this matter. Despite having a stubborn character, Dou Fanggang was actually an overgrown child in his heart. However, Su Tao still maintained his respect for the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Song Sichen wants to take you in as a disciple, don’t reject him because of me!” Dou Fanggang lowered his voice and continued, “Old Song is an expert in diagnosis, and in my view, that’s what you lack right now. If you can learn his skills, then you will not be far from being a legendary divine physician.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing Dou Fanggang’s words, Su Tao sighed in his heart. At this moment, he realised that Dou Fanggang was trying to prod Song Sichen into teaching him by using a psychological provocation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dou Fanggang continued, “I’ve known him for over thirty years, and we have been competing for our entire lifetime. So I understand him, and that old fellow is a sophisticated person. He already had the intention to take you in as a disciple, but he couldn’t pull his face down. He couldn’t be so straightforward like me, so I had to provoke him into making a move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the light into this matter, Su Tao smiled. “So that’s the case!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dou Fanggang continued to reminisce about the past, “When Song Sichen was young, he was in love with a girl that was three years younger than him. Knowing that she liked men who can sing, he learned how to sing for half a year. In the end, that girl married a butcher before he could even confess.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Su Tao was touched. “So Senior Song is so infatuated when it comes to love.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What use is there for being infatuated?” Dou Fanggang unhappily replied, “If you like something, then you have to grab it. He has gone muddle-headed once again and was playing the boiling frog tactic. So I had to remind him! Furthermore, you’re also similar to me. You’re not a foolishly good person like Old Song, you’re someone who would retaliate when encountering anything unfair!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Sichen and Dou Fanggang, one of them was gentle, while the other one was firm. Their characters were akin to water and fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a wry smile, Su Tao responded, “Perhaps Old Song isn’t how you imagined him to be!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his finger, Dou Fanggang confidently said, “Old Song already had his eyes on you at the Physician King Tournament, and he has been observing your personality and ethics. Truth be told, I don’t have that many rules. I only accepted you because I took a liking to you. Haha! I believe Old Song will not be able to sleep tonight, and he might even rush down to He City tomorrow. So I’ll not be in a rush to leave, and I can meet up with him to catch up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how Dou Fanggang nitpicked about Song Sichen, Su Tao felt touched. On the same journey, the two of them were both competitors and friends, working together on their ideals. But it was a pity that he lacked someone like that in his path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng was too small-minded, and he wasn’t talented enough!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kim Jung-ho’s medical skills were pretty good, but he’s definitely not someone Su Tao could work together with!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the path of a genius was determined to be lonely, and it required a firm heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While taking out two books with yellowed front covers, Dou Fanggang smiled. “Since I’ve accepted you as my disciple, then I have to teach you something. These books are the medical notes that I’ve taken down for the past five years, which I would occasionally flip through them. Now, I’m handing them over to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The medical journal of a physician was akin to a sword in the hands of an assassin. Passing his medical journals to Su Tao, that spoke of his sincerity, and he wasn’t only taking Su Tao in as a nominal disciple, he wanted someone to inherit his medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao immediately, respectfully stretched his hands out and received the medical journals from Dou Fanggang. “I will read them in earnest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Patting Su Tao’s shoulder, Dou Fanggang laughed, “I’ve seen myself in you, someone who thirsts for medical knowledge, and I’m relieved!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Su Tao shocked. Dou Fanggang did not have the slightest solemnness or stubbornness at this moment. He shared all his medical knowledge with Su Tao without any reservations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the journal left by his grandfather, Dou Fanggang’s journal was on another level, since his medical standards and status determined that he would have a broader experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The title of a grandmaster wasn’t for naught, and many complicated theories have been simplified through Dou Fanggang’s explanations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Putting it in a nutshell, Su Tao benefited greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them sat in the consultation room for an entire night. Even for their meal, they handled it in a rush, and they only ended their conversation on the second day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just as Dou Fanggang had predicted. Song Sichen rushed over to He City the afternoon of the next day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Dou Fanggang’s urges, Song Sichen and Su Tao performed a simple ceremony. In just a span of two days, Su Tao has gained himself two masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were people who Su Tao admired, and he was grateful for what they’ve done so far to help him. Since they had a relationship as master and disciple, Su Tao now had a backing and foundation in the TCM industry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it couldn’t be compared to Wang Guofeng, who had two Imperial Physicians in his family, Su Tao was also considered to be from famous masters. No matter where he goes, just mentioning the names of his masters would make people look at him in another light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the realism of society. People would usually judge you on your background before your strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I initially wanted to accept Su Tao as my disciple later due to the National Healer Candidacy, and to avoid suspicion.” Song Sichen glanced at Dou Fanggang with a complicated gaze, since this fellow has ruined his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With Su Tao’s ability, it won’t be tough for him to get through the National Healer Candidacy!” Dou Fanggang confidently declared, “The reason why I did this is to increase Su Tao’s foundation and reputation. Otherwise, he would surely be struck off from the initial investigation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Song Sichen nodded his head. The National Healer Candidacy had a strict investigation procedure to check on the candidates’ backgrounds. Even if they had a clean background, it wouldn’t be easy to get through the investigation if you did not come from a famous master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Glancing at Su Tao, Song Sichen said, “Xia Dechun already recommended you for this year’s National Healer Candidacy. Even if it’s still not the right time, I feel that you should challenge yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao smiled. “I will do my best to prepare, and I will not disappoint my two masters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A new force emerged to be reckoned with during the Physician King Tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the International Medical Summit, TCM has proven itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the National Healer Candidacy was another difficulty he had to face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">China’s foundation ran deep, and it was filled with couching tigers and hidden dragons. Every year, the National Healer Candidacy would be filled with outstanding talents, and not only did he have to face TCM talents, but he also had to face elites of Western Medicine. Hence, the difficulty would be greater than what he faced in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Song Sichen and Dou Fanggang smiled in rapport. Su Tao needed tempering, and he needed to suffer a setback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s because Su Tao’s path has been too smooth, and they wanted to slow down Su Tao’s speed for him to focus more on his medical skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their thoughts were understandable, since they finally encountered a hope for TCM to rise at their old age. Hence, they were afraid that it might end prematurely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Song Sichen came to He City, Su Tao wasn’t polite and requested him to conduct a charity consultation for two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter could understand Su Tao’s intention. The charity consultation was just a façade. Su Tao wanted to learn from him, and he naturally wouldn’t refuse it.</span></p>
