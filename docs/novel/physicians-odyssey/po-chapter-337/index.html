<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a strict requirement for the National Healer Candidacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Firstly, not everyone was qualified for it, and even National Healers were classified into ranks. Western Medicine held a nobler position, since they would take up 80% of the doctors in important events. Hence, Western Medicine doctors held a higher position amongst the National Healers, which equated to more recommendations. Cao Dingjun had a high status, which Su Tao could tell from how Xia Dechun was dispatched over as his private doctor. That meant that the latter also had a high position amongst the ranks of National Healers, and he was already close to reaching the top of the pyramid. Thus, he naturally possessed the qualifications to make a recommendation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secondly, there was also a rule in making recommendations, since western medicine doctors would usually recommend talents versed in western medicine, and that was the same with TCM physicians. Hence, Xia Dechun’s act of supporting Su Tao was considered to have broken the rules, which was the reason why Su Tao was so taken aback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thirdly, there were risks involved in recommending someone. If you recommended someone with ill intentions and caused any trouble, you would be implicated by your candidate. Then again, Xia Dechun wasn’t worried about that. After all, someone that even Sire Shui trusted must definitely not have any issues with his background.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Xia, I’m grateful for your intention, but this favour is too great!” Su Tao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, no, no!” Xia Dechun shook his head and firmly replied, “Truth be told, you’re the most talented doctor I’ve ever seen. Recommending you as a National Healer is my respect and responsibility for the medical industry. After all, it’s too much of a pity for a talent like you to wander around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more Xia Dechun thought about this, the more he felt certain about his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Cao Huaiqing rushed over and smiled. “I’ve already found the apparatuses in the TCM Department.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao smiled. “Then I’ll head over immediately! Here are some common herbs that should be present in the hospital. Please arrange for someone to get them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Receiving the list from Su Tao, Cao Huaiqing personally made a trip to grab them himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some stuff that Su Tao could handle himself, but he could arrange some necessary workload over to the Cao Family especially. This illness wasn’t something that could be easily treated. He didn’t hope that the Cao Family would be more grateful for him, but he hoped that they could do their best to cooperate in the treatment of Cao Dingjun and wouldn’t go along with the latter’s temper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Treating someone was a profound study, and a good doctor had many factors to consider. There would be a reason hidden behind every step, which required polishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite appearing to have treated Cao Dingjun with a few needles, it wasn’t as simple as how it looked. On the contrary, the profundities in it were something that not even those in the same industry could analyse the entire process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if anyone happened to understand what was going on in the treatment, they would be filled with admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brewing medicine was more complicated than cooking. Not only was there a strict requirement in apparatuses, but both the heat and time had to be taken into consideration. At the same time, the procedures of putting the herbs inside were also different, since different procedures would have a different effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, ordinary physicians knew how to brew general herbs, such as shells, minerals, and bone ingredients; they generally had to be first placed into a pot for ten minutes before other medicines can be placed in it. Whereas for honeysuckles, forsythia, peppermint, and other similar herbs; they had to be fried for ten minutes before being placed into the pot, since these herbs generally came with an aroma, which would be dimmed down through frying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was personally brewing the Mind Revitalizing Soup for Cao Dingjun. This recipe required Cloud Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only was there a high difficulty in picking Cloud Grass, but there was also a complicated method to preserve it. When frying, there was a strict requirement for the heat, and when the frying process was completed, it had to be placed into the pot within three minutes. When a patient is consuming it, they had to do it within five minutes or the efficiency would drop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green pellet that Su Tao gave Sire Shui also contained the composition of Cloud Grass, and special methods were required to preserve its medicinal effects. Hence, Su Tao only managed to create a few pellets, which every single one of them was priceless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Shui Junzhuo watched Su Tao working from the side, she said, “You can actually have someone brew the medicine for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao smiled and responded, “I know how to goof off, but I have to handle this personally. The sequence isn’t widely known, and I’m afraid of losing the medicinal effects.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, how long are you staying in Minnan Province?” Shui Junzhuo suddenly asked with her voice lowered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m afraid that I will have to stay here for about a week.” After a brief pondering, Su Tao asked, “What’s wrong? You have to return?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, there are many matters on hand that await me, so I have to leave tonight.” Shui Junzhuo’s voice was filled with reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Work is important!” After a brief pondering, Su Tao continued, “Don’t worry. There are still many opportunities for us to meet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should really consider Senior Xia’s suggestion!” Shui Junzhuo caressed her hair as she continued, “With your medical skills, you can only put them to full use in Beijing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want me to go to Beijing so we’ll have more opportunities to meet, right?” Su Tao fanned the fire as he teased Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His words instantly made Shui Junzhuo’s face blush as she replied with a lowered voice, “I’m being considerate for your future; what has it got to do with us meeting more often? Is that even important?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, it’s important. It gives me another reason to go to Beijing!” Su Tao responded with splendour in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Going to Beijing was a special stop in life, since it was the capital of China. Not only were the medical standards there much higher, but the talented elites of TCM were also gathered there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although China was known for its vast land and people with many divine physicians living the life of hermits amongst the people, Beijing was still a must-see stop in his life. If he wanted the Three Flavour Hall to succeed, then he would have to gain a stable footing in Beijing. Hence, he had already set his eyes on Beijing after the successful launch of He City’s Three Flavour Hall branch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a lot of preparatory work he had to do before he could implement this plan, such as picking out a location for his flagship store with a capable physician in-house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, the development of the Three Flavour Hall by far was merely preparation work done for entering Beijing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, he wasn’t an ambitious fellow, but he knew that this was an important step if he wanted to fulfil Su Guangsheng’s dying wish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a group of people around him. He can afford to goof off, but he had to take responsibility for the dreams of those around him and structure his ideal TCM Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been less than a year since he set off on this path, and he has already earned himself several achievements. But he has only made little progress in his grand blueprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brewing the medicine took half an hour. Shui Junzhuo stood to the side, patiently watching Su Tao as he worked. Despite wearing a calm expression, there was a rhythm in every single one of his actions, so why did he want Shui Junzhuo around while he works? Well, he wanted to show his cooler side and impress her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Alas, Shui Junzhuo was someone with rationale, and she cursed herself when she recovered from the intoxication of being a love-struck fool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the soup was finally prepared, Su Tao looked extremely cautious as he placed the Cloud Grass in it. It was a critical factor for Cao Dingjun recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a breeze blew from the door along with a voice, “So you’re here!” Cao Jiaojiao snorted in anger the moment she came. There were two robust men around her dressed in casual clothing. The two of them had a buzz cut, and they showed extremely solemn expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve already allowed your grandpa to regain his consciousness, so I believe that there’s no reason for you to find trouble with me, is there?” Su Tao couldn’t be bothered with Cao Jiaojiao, since he has reached the crucial moment in the brewing process. He was only relying on what he read from the Imperial Physician Scripture and based on his understanding of the herbs. So it would all be ruined if there was a slight mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You conman!” Cao Jiaojiao was fuming in anger the more she thought about it, which she returned to give Su Tao a taste of bitter medicine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This princess was spoilt. She felt a bone in her throat when she was humiliated by her father, Cao Huaiqing. This was also the reason why she returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she bellowed, she waved her hand to order the two men. The two robust men instantly pounced in the direction of Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To protect the medicine, Su Tao could only stand at the front. But those two men naturally wouldn’t be bothered with it so much. One of them lashed out a kick. Although Su Tao could easily dodge it, it also meant that his medicine would go down the drain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he could only gnash his teeth and hold onto the long handle of the pot. Although the handle wasn’t as hot as the bottom, it was burning when Su Tao held it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a leap, Su Tao lashed out a kick in the face of that man, which the latter groaned and scattered everything in the room when he flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing the commotion, Ah Jun immediately charged in. Although Cao Jiaojiao brought elites of the military over, they were kids in the eyes of Ah Jun. After the latter simply threw out his fists and lashed out his legs, the two men swiftly dropped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene had left Cao Jiaojiao terrified. She was looking at Ah Jun and Su Tao with astonishment. The situation has evolved beyond her expectations. The two helpers that she brought over had their bums kicked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you alright?” Shui Junzhuo rushed over. Although Su Tao has already placed the pot down, his hand must definitely be burnt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m fine. It will be fine in a few days after applying some scald burn ointment!” Su Tao felt the pain coming from his palm, but he was speechless at this moment. Cao Jiaojiao was simply beyond hope. Here he was, trying to save the life of her family, and she actually came over to look for trouble. She was simply too spoilt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Huaiqing had also heard the commotion and rushed in. When he looked into the room, he roughly guessed what happened and gave a slap at Cao Jiaojiao’s face without a second thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a crisp and resounding slap that instantly left Cao Jiaojiao dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dad, you actually hit me for an outsider?!” Cao Jiaojiao was completely stunned. She never felt so humiliated since young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s a benefactor of the Cao Family!” Giving another slap over, Cao Huaiqing bellowed, “Apologise to Physician Su, now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As grievance rammed Cao Jiaojiao’s heart, she turned around and ran off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Cao Huaiqing sincerely apologised when he saw Su Tao holding onto his hand, “I’m sorry. I’ve failed to teach my daughter, I will apologise to you on her behalf!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re too serious! There’s still another procedure for the medicine to be done. I will send it to Sire Cao in a bit!” Despite the scalding pain, Su Tao still persevered to complete his task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Su Tao’s professionalism, Cao Huaiqing’s heart was assaulted by guilt.</span></p>
