 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao wasn’t fond of mistresses as they usually break up families. In his view, they weren’t a bunch of people that he could accept. However, Su Tao did not feel as disgusted with Qin Meimei as he’d imagined. Perhaps it was due to the fact that he had interacted with her for a long time and he could sense the innocence in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Love was equivalent to a devil’s den. The moment you entered, it wouldn’t be easy for you to get out. There was nothing Qin Meimei could do about it. She made a mistake and was covered in wounds before finding out about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had made a mistake with Li Yede. She shouldn’t have gotten into a relationship that bore no fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a person makes a mistake, they would wake up to reality and make up for their mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao couldn’t help thinking about the other mistress that he happens to know, the anchor, Yin Le. At this moment, he wondered how she was doing now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Qin Meimei removed her trousers at the backseat, she discovered that she could no longer continue wearing them since they have become all sticky. Hence, she could only remove her underwear and see if she could clean it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t turn around!” Qin Meimei glared at Su Tao as she warned. Although she wouldn’t mind letting Su Tao glance at her bottom or chest since she wasn’t exactly a conservative woman, she’s still mindful of her secretion. After all, she couldn’t bear the thought of disgusting Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Women dolled themselves to make themselves look better to leave a better impression of someone else. So if someone saw her in this condition, Qin Meimei would rather die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, I’m focused on driving; I can’t be bothered to look at you.” Although Su Tao had an urge in his heart, he still kept his demon suppressed. Humans were generally curious, especially when having a woman removing her trousers in the backseat while you’re driving. Honestly speaking, how many men can endure the temptation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As scuffles resounded from the backseat, a peculiar smell permeated. Su Tao knew that it was the sanitary pad’s sterilisation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What luck! It’s fine if it’s not coming, but why is there so much?! It’s so sticky and disgusting!” Qin Meimei also had no idea if she was muttering to herself or if she was purposely saying that to Su Tao. Regardless, her description was pretty sexy as she said, “Hand me some tissue!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was briefly stunned before he sourly replied, “I’m driving, don’t disrupt my focus!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cut the nonsense. My tissue is finished, and I still can’t clean it. Don’t make me go crazy; women aren’t in a good mood when this comes.” Qin Meimei threatened, “Quick! Or I’ll fight with you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was startled by Qin Meimei’s barbaric declaration. He had no idea what she might do if she really went insane. Hence, he could only hand the tissue over to the backseat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking it from Su Tao, Qin Meimei smiled. “I never expected that you’re pretty honest! If it’s another man, they probably wouldn’t be able to hold back their temptation from looking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out an awkward cough, Su Tao sourly responded, “There’s nothing to look at. Many of my patients are female, and I’m already used to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Meimei pinched her nose as she cleaned it up and disposed of it before teasing Su Tao, “People say that male doctors in gynaecology are generally indifferent in that matter since they’re used to seeing it. Since you’ve seen the body of so many women, do you also have that sort of mental barrier as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wrinkles covered Su Tao’s forehead as he replied, “That’s spreading falsehood. A doctor is actually no different from an ordinary person, and that goes the same for gynaecologists. Furthermore, I’m a physician. Although I do deal with gynaecology, I don’t require the patients to strip themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Meimei could hear the annoyance in Su Tao’s tone, which she felt prideful. After all, some women generally liked seeing someone in an awkward situation, since they felt that life was interesting that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you want to look at mine?” Qin Meimei continued her teases.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not interested!” At this moment, Su Tao only felt that Qin Meimei was being childish. After all, he would fall for her trap if he took her words seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boring!” Seeing that Su Tao was not taking the bait, Qin Meimei helplessly shrugged her shoulders and her gaze landed on the tainted trousers. In the end, she still felt that it was a little disgusting and gave up wearing the underwear before sticking the sanitary pad on her trousers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In order to show consideration for Qin Meimei, Su Tao purposely slowed down his speed as the Volkswagen CC drove on the low-speed path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Qin Meimei wanted to wear her trousers, a BMW drove from the left and jammed the break. Su Tao was startled by this scene and he jammed the breaks as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because the backseat was already narrow, to begin with, Qin Meimei lost her centre of gravity and her head bumped into the seat while she exclaimed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister Meimei, are you alright?” Although Su Tao wasn’t a road rager, he still felt his rage brimming when someone jammed their breaks on the highway. However, Qin Meimei was putting her trousers on, so he did not chase after the car and tried to maintain the speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I seem to have sprained my wrist!” Qin Meimei recovered from the shock after a long while and realised that she couldn’t exert any force on her wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao stopped the car to the side and turned on the hazard warning lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He first took out a warning sign from the trunk of the car before he opened the backdoor, which Qin Meimei immediately yelled, “Close the door!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Su Tao soon understood that Qin Meimei only had her trousers up to her shank with her knees exposed. Although she tried her best to pull her shirt down to cover her thigh, her pearly skin was still revealed. They’re currently on the highway, and if the door wasn’t closed, wouldn’t others see everything?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she’s open-minded, she’s still mindful of her own image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao closed the door, Qin Meimei wiggled her body to the side. Since she was afraid that she might be exposed, she kept her hand on her shirt. But the more she did that, the more awkward it seemed. Although Su Tao was trying to restrain his gaze, he still caught sight of something he shouldn’t. In his heart, he was constantly chanting Buddhism prayers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two sat in the backseat, Qin Meimei could notice the changes in Su Tao’s eyes at such a close distance. Hence, she felt both anxious and furious, but there was nothing she could do as her wrist is definitely sprained. Not to mention that her trousers were also extremely tight; it was impossible for her to put them on with one hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you done looking?!” Qin Meimei gently snorted. “If it was some other time, I might really gobble you up. But it’s not convenient today, and I’m afraid that you might be disgusted!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was instantly left speechless by Qin Meimei’s barbaric speech. This was the might of Qin Meimei who could speak so boldly and unrestrained. Hence, he immediately explained, “Don’t misunderstand. I just want to take a look at your wrist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Meimei gently sighed and felt complex in her heart. Su Tao was Yan Jing’s lover, and she was Yan Jing’s best friend. So she can’t have any intention towards him since it was an act of betrayal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Su Tao placed Qin Meimei’s wrist on his palm, he gently massaged it and said, “Big Sister Meimei, you’re too skinny. You should take good care of yourself or you might be blown away if there’s a huge wind one day!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Responding to his words, Qin Meimei sourly snapped, “If there’s really such a powerful wind, then I might as well die and be blown to the north pole. Furthermore, skinny is beauty in our society. If I become a fatty, I will be despised!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao smiled, “A real mature man likes pork belly as lean meat is tiring to chew. On the other hand, a mixture of the two is more tender and fragrant!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you treating women like pigs?” Qin Meimei was teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of a sudden, a pop sounded out and her wrist was fixed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Done!” Su Tao sighed and felt heavily relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qin Meimei tried to wave her wrist, it was no longer hurting. So it turned out that Su Tao was trying to divert her attention and treated her wrist without her knowing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How fortunate to have a divine physician around to fix all injuries instantly. At this moment, I’m even feeling envious of Yan Jing.” Qin Meimei straightforwardly expressed her gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Put on your trousers!” Su Tao wryly smiled. There was a truck that just passed by, which purposely slowed down its speed and even wound down the window, looking over. Evidently, that person was extremely curious about the vehicle that was suddenly parked by the side of the highway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t it a blessing if I put it on slower?” Qin Meimei chuckled as she teased, “Why don’t you take a few more looks? You won’t have another opportunity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao was a little sorry-looking as he came out of the backseat. He felt a little heat rising up from Qin Meimei’s constant ambiguous words. It seems like she didn’t understand men too well. They’re not afraid of any indirect psychological method. If they’re in a secluded place, he might even make Qin Meimei pay some price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That truck from earlier was a couple sending goods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wife nudged the husband’s elbow and asked, “Do you know what I’ve just seen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The husband has been driving for the past few hours and looked somewhat exhausted with a cigarette hanging on his lips. Even if he took two puffs, his mentality was still depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There seems to be a couple in that car doing… that!” The wife smiled mysteriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must have seen it wrong, right?” The husband’s spirit instantly jolted as his wife’s discovery was akin to a stimulant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can I have seen it wrong?” The wife recalled what she had seen earlier and continued, “Although they covered it well, that woman wasn’t wearing any trousers and her butt was out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The husband awkwardly coughed and felt pity that he had missed that view, then angrily said, “People are too daring nowadays! They’re even doing such things in daylight? How outrageous!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wife briefly hesitated before she mysteriously smiled. “Focus on driving. We’ll try that tonight as well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cigarette on the husband’s lips nearly fell as ashes fell on his trousers before he smiled. “Hehe, right. Hehe, we can try that tonight as well!”</span></p>
