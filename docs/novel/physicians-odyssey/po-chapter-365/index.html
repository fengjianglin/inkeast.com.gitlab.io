 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they came out of the restaurant, Mo Sun’er forcefully pulled her hand back. Wang Guofeng smiled. He wasn’t bothered by it and opened the front passenger seat to his Range Rover. “Sun’er, let me bring you somewhere! It’s been a long time since we last met, and I want to talk to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Mo Sun’er had no idea why her mood was so depressed. She had a crush on Wang Guofeng for a long time, but she felt uncomfortable by his sudden intimate actions today. Why were her emotions so tangled up? Hasn’t talking with Senior Brother Guofeng for an entire day been her wish?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get in.” Wang Guofeng noted Mo Sun’er’s emotions and asked, “Are you still unhappy about what just happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Mo Sun’er replied, “Senior Brother, I think there’s a misunderstanding between you and Su Tao. The two of you are actually outstanding, so why don’t the two of you cooperate? I believe that if the two of you cooperated together, you guys could surely change TCM.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wang Guofeng’s face sank before he grimly said, “Sun’er, you don’t understand the conflict between Su Tao and me. In the future, I don’t want to hear those words coming from you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Mo Sun’er sighed. She became nervous when she made Wang Guofeng angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was what girls were like; the moment they fall in love and throw themselves in it; they would change into the passive person. Although Mo Sun’er would occasionally be unruly when she’s with Su Tao, she was like a docile lamb with Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head in satisfaction, Wang Guofeng took out a bouquet of flowers from the back seat and smiled. “For you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Mo Sun’er’s eyes flickered. “It’s really a surprise!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng smiled. “It’s good that you like it! Sun’er, did you know? You’re really charming when you smile!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er felt her face turning red. All girls like to be praised, especially when it comes from someone they had a crush on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Senior Brother! I’m really happy today!” Mo Sun’er placed the bouquet before her nose and took a sniff, basking in the fragrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thirteen roses represent a lifetime!” Wang Guofeng noted Mo Sun’er’s emotions and continued, “In my heart, you’re always a lovable Junior Sister of mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er became depressed. It turned out that Wang Guofeng only treated her as a Junior Sister. Squeezing out a smile, she responded, “You will always be my Senior Brother!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few years ago, Wang Guofeng drove a Toyota Camry, but his lifestyle has undergone a drastic change after interacting with Bai Fan. The latter’s lifestyle has slowly influenced Wang Guofeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Wang Guofeng’s status and wealth, it’s definitely impossible for him to drive a Range Rover that costs over a million. He never lacked gold diggers that tried to approach him, and he would practically have one every day, which he could easily get them onto the bed after a meal with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Mo Sun’er wasn’t the same; she was a pure lotus in Wang Guofeng’s heart. Wang Guofeng watched her grow up, and she’s both intelligent and lively; he has treated her as a younger sister. Although his engagement with Liu Ruochen has been canceled, he still maintained contact with Mo Sun’er, since he knew that the latter has considered him as her idol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was intoxicated with his life, he still maintained contact with Mo Sun’er every day, and he could see his past from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans were that conflicted. Despite enjoying their current life, they would often reminisce about the past. Although his previous lifestyle wasn’t that exciting, it was focused. He could concentrate all his energy on medical books and acupuncture techniques to the point of even neglecting sleep and food. But right now, he was living a life of debauchery, using alcohol to numb his nerves and women to numb his body. However, he often felt empty because he lost his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps Mo Sun’er was a way for him to find himself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After arriving at the hotel that he’s staying at today, the service crew delivered a bottle of red wine and some desserts. After Wang Guofeng removed his outer coat and hung it in the wardrobe, he turned to Mo Sun’er with a smile, “Why don’t you remove your shoes? It’ll be more comfortable!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er dolled herself up since she was meeting Wang Guofeng today. She wore a pair of heels, but they weren’t comfortable since she wasn’t used to them. However, she still gnashed her teeth to persevere. Seeing Wang Guofeng retrieving a pair of sandals over, she removed her heels and wanted to change into them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a smile, Wang Guofeng kneeled beside Mo Sun’er and held onto her foot and massaged it. “See, it’s all swollen. You’re a physician, so why aren’t you taking care of yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Guofeng’s technique was unique and gentle, akin to a feather. Every single movement would alleviate the swelling of the foot. However, Mo Sun’er was extremely nervous, since it was ambiguous for a man to massage her foot in a hotel room. At this moment, she was trying her best to convince herself to exercise restraint and maintain her rationale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, there’s no need for you to do this! I can put some ointment on it myself later, and it will be fine after a night!” Mo Sun’er immediately pulled her leg away from Wang Guofeng’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Wang Guofeng gently looked at Mo Sun’er. The service crew had already uncorked the red wine and poured it in the decanter. After pouring red wine into two cups, he handed one over to Mo Sun’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Mo Sun’er received it, she took a sip. However, she wasn’t fond of the red wine’s taste. It was too sour, and her face cringed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Mo Sun’er’s face, Wang Guofeng burst into laughter. “You don’t have to force yourself if you don’t like it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My Senior Sister doesn’t allow me to touch alcohol!” Mo Sun’er said with a difficult expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s too old-fashioned!” Wang Guofeng smiled. “People should learn how to be flexible. Although alcohol will hold things back, reasonable drinking can help the body relax and relieve pressure. Red wine is also beneficial for women since it can nourish their skin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking her head, Mo Sun’er replied, “Senior Sister said that alcohol has benefits, and we can’t touch it easily as it could cause addiction, which won’t be easy to get rid of it. Alcohol might be beneficial, but drinking it will make you want more. I don’t want to be a drunkard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Wang Guofeng smiled in self-ridicule. “Sun’er has grown up. I never expected that you would speak such reasonable words! Forget it. I’ll listen to you and stop drinking. Why don’t we have a chat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er nodded her head and felt that Wang Guofeng was genuinely a gentleman who respected her thoughts. He was so much better than Su Tao, who was overbearing. He one-sidedly decided many things in the Three Flavour Hall without any democracy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, there’s actually a chance for you and my Senior Sister to get back together. My master is still fond of you! Although my Senior Sister has her own views, she will listen to master’s words!” Mo Sun’er patiently persuaded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Casting a complicated glance at Mo Sun’er, Wang Guofeng smiled in ridicule but he did not reply to that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Brother, why aren’t you talking?” Mo Sun’er suddenly became nervous. Did she say something wrong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Wang Guofeng sighed, “I never expected that you would have such thoughts! Ruochen and I have come to an end.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Mo Sun’er’s emotions stirred. “In my view, you and Senior Sister are a perfect pair, and there’s no one more suitable to you two. Senior Sister also has you in her heart, and I feel that she’s only testing you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Test?” A wry smile hung on Wang Guofeng’s lips. “There are many things that you’re unaware of, and you guys have been hoodwinked!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief stun, Mo Sun’er asked, “There must be a misunderstanding. Why don’t you tell me, and I’ll talk to Senior Sister and resolve your misunderstanding?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The truth lies in front of the eye!” Wang Guofeng firmly shook his head and continued, “In the period that Liu Ruochen participated at the International Medical Summit, she did not go with the group, but privately went with Su Tao. They even stayed in a hotel together and behaved intimately…” As Wang Guofeng spoke, his voice became hoarse, as if he couldn’t continue talking anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could Senior Sister do this?!” Mo Sun’er sucked in a cold breath. In her heart, Liu Ruochen was akin to her biological sister, and she should be together with Wang Guofeng. Only the two of them were well paired together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wang Guofeng’s words were akin to a rod that smashed her fairy tale apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is the truth of reality!” Sorrow flickered in Wang Guofeng’s eyes. “Actually, I have already thought things through. Perhaps this is only a test in life, and I’ve recently felt suppressed in my heart. But for some reason, everything clears up when I see you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er felt nervous. She kneaded her finger and squeezed out a smile. “Senior Brother, no matter what, you’re still the most outstanding man in my heart. It’s my Senior Sister’s loss for not choosing you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile rose on Wang Guofeng’s face as he replied, “Yeah. After such a long time of pondering, I’ve finally walked out of the shadow. So I want to choose a new partner that’s suitable for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good that you can think this way!” Mo Sun’er felt turmoil in her heart. It’s mainly due to the intimate relationship between Liu Ruochen and Su Tao that Wang Guofeng spoke about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Does Su Tao really have that much charm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cai Yan likes him, Xiao Jingjing adores him, and even a merchant, Yan Jing, has an ambiguous relationship with him. How could her Senior Sister fall for such a playboy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the changes in Mo Sun’er’s emotions, Wang Guofeng suddenly grabbed onto her hands. “Sun’er, the reason why I wanted to meet you privately today is to confess to you. You’re that person suitable for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mo Sun’er instantly widened her eyes with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s going on? Is she dreaming? Her Senior Brother confessed to her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was something that not even she dared to dream of!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, she wanted to pinch her cheeks, but her hands were held by Wang Guofeng and couldn’t move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her body trembled. Although she knew that it wasn’t a dream, she still wanted to verify if it was true!</span></p>
