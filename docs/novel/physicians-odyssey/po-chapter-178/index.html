 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After knowing Achim’s location, Vera wasn’t willing to return, which Su Tao could see through her thoughts. Thus, he pulled her along as they strolled around, but he instantly regretted his suggestion when he saw how Vera was wholly immersed in shopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of her clothes were custom-made brands, with several designated brands sending clothes to her at regular intervals. Strictly speaking, this was still the first time that she tasted the joy of shopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why women often changed clothes wasn’t that they’re in love with the clothes, but the praises that they receive from sales staff from the side in those clothes. In that situation, regardless of whether they were beautiful or ugly, sales staff would start promoting and praises every single bit of clothing their customer changed into. Naturally, as a perfect clothing shelf, Vera looked ideal in every outfit, as if they were custom-made for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao helplessly shook his head as he paid for Vera’s purchase. He felt that this woman must be insane today, she had already bought seven to eight pieces of clothing, looking like a shopping freak. However, Su Tao still showed a pretty enjoyable expression with a smile on his face. Whenever Vera changed her clothes, he would have to reveal shock on his face and shower her in praises. At this point, the slightest unhappiness you show would be detected by the woman’s sensitive sixth sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera was delighted when Su Tao paid for her purchases. To win a woman’s heart, you would have to act sometimes, despite accompanying a woman shopping being a tedious job.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After visiting two more shops, Vera noticed that the shop before her was closing and the staff had already started to clean up. She hesitated, “Why don’t we call it an end? They’re preparing to close already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his fingers, Su Tao smiled. “No way. You must not have regrets when it comes to shopping. Who knows, the clothes you like might be in the next store.” As he spoke, he looked down on himself as his soul was already hollering to end this boring shopping!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera took two glances at Su Tao, whose eyes beamed, and entered the store. Despite being close to their closing time, the staff still passionately came up to serve them when they saw the two of them walking in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Vera walked out with a small bag, she realised that the surrounding shops have closed. Su Tao shook the bags he’s holding. “Are you satisfied now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera pursed his lips and smiled. “Shopping can truly release stress. All my unhappiness has disappeared!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao looked at Vera’s face as he reminded, “But running cannot solve the issue, and some things have to be faced. Only by resolving it, can you be truly free.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a sigh, Vera asked, “Achim wants to talk with you, but I feel that it’s between him and me so you shouldn’t be involved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tapping his finger on his lips, Su Tao tried to get Vera to recall the experience in the theatre, so he smiled. “How can I sit still after seeing our relationship?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera’s face blushed as she lowered her voice, “Didn’t you say that you’re just conducting treatment for me? So our relationship is just that of a doctor and patient.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his fingers, Su Tao sniffed as he shyly replied, “Treatment is just an excuse, are you really that stupid, or are you just faking it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera was stunned, before she felt like she was burning. She lowered her head. For a brief moment, she actually had no idea how to reply to Su Tao’s words. What’s Su Tao doing? A confession? She had actually been nervous, since she had no idea about Su Tao’s attitude towards her, despite the fact that the two of them were intimate numerous times. But for some reason, Su Tao gave her a feeling as if he was treating her like his patient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera felt her wrist being pulled, so she came to a stop. Looking at her, Su Tao smiled. “You’re walking too quickly. Wait for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao took the bags in her hand. With the bags on his right, he held onto Vera’s hand with his left hand. Feeling the warmth that came from their contact, Vera lowered her head and felt a sweetness spreading out in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this the legendary feeling of holding hands?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For her, this moment was so much sweeter and wonderful than the movie theatre because she could clearly feel her heart throbbing. At the same time, she could also feel that Su Tao was experiencing the same thing as her, both of their hearts throbbing as they resonated with each other and composed the most wonderful beat in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao could also sense it. Initially, Vera was someone from a different world from him. Despite that he adored Vera, he could feel the distance between them. But after today, he realised that the heart of this woman had been close to him, and all he needed to do was grab her. She’s like a kite, despite fluttering in the air, there’s also a string that linked them together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them did not speak as they came to the carpark before their hands split. Su Tao placed the bags in the back trunk, then sat in the driver’s seat. Vera was in the front passenger’s seat. She lowered her head and asked, “Su Tao, are we considered dating?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao smiled as he took a deep breath before he replied, “Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera smiled at herself in ridicule as she responded, “But I’m a greedy person, and I cannot guarantee that I will always love you. Will you hate me if we break up one day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao blankly smiled. “Shouldn’t that be the question I ask you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Answer me!” Vera demanded with a firm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief silence, Su Tao slowly replied, “I will not hate you. I will only do my best to tangle up with you until you change your mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera blinked her eyes before she nodded her head in satisfaction. “That’s also the answer and promise I’m giving you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Starting the engine of the Volkswagen CC, Su Tao faintly said, “Right now, I’ll meet with that fiancé of yours and let him know that he’s just a laughable flea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao’s naming for Achim teased Vera, so she laughed, “If Achim Belyakov hears that you called him a flea, he’ll probably blow his head, since he has been viewing himself as someone with a noble bloodline, an elite of society!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 0pt 12pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed, “Actually, I’m seeing him to tell him that he’s not any different from an ordinary person.”</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There can be no tasty desserts, but there must be vodka; there can be no jokes, but there must be vodka; there can be no beautiful women, but there must be vodka; vodka, the more, the better! In Russia, men and women alike like to drink vodka, since it originated from their country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The color of Vodka was clear as water, and the taste wasn’t too strong with only a subtle, delicate flavor to it. Vodka didn’t have any sour, bitter, and sweet taste, but it’s refreshing. There’s only one distinctive feature about it, the burning sensation due to the high alcohol percentage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he knew it, Achim had already finished a bottle of Vodka. Vera must be fooling around with that Chinese man, since she still hadn’t returned at this time, and the more he thought about it, the more furious Achim got. Before he knew it, he had already finished one bottle and asked Shara for another one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Missy has returned!” Shara glanced at Achim, who reeked of alcohol, and sighed. She could understand his feelings right now, and she would feel the same as him if she was standing in his shoes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Achim gently let out a breath as he stood up and tidied his clothes before he nodded at Shara with a smile. “Good, bring me to her!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Vera walked out of the front passenger seat, she saw Achim standing by the door, so she knitted her brows. “Why are you still here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Achim first took a glance at Su Tao before he looked at Vera. “Vera, my fiancée, I came to Hanzhou especially for you. Must you be so cruel to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera sighed as she glanced at Shara. “Why did you let him in the house, and even give my phone number to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a grave expression, Shara responded, “Missy, I can’t possibly allow our son-in-law to wait outside for you. It would show our lack of manners.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera helplessly shook her head before she said to Achim, “You can leave now. I don’t welcome you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Disappointment flashed on Achim’s face before he shook his head and walked towards Vera. “You can’t treat me so ruthlessly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Achim blocking her path, Vera’s face turned cold. “Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Achim pulled Vera’s arm as he tried to be more intimate with her, “What do you want me to do? I can do anything for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vera sighed, “Achim, can you please calm down?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold sneer appeared on the corner of Achim’s lips before he removed his blazer and unbuttoned his shirt, revealing his well-built physique. He then turned to look at Su Tao with his finger pointed out. “Let’s fight as men. If you win, I will back off. If I win, you will never appear before Vera ever again.”</span></p>
