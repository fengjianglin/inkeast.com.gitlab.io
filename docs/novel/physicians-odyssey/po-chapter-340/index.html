 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If an ordinary person tried holding alcohol in their mouth, they would still be affected by the drug ten minutes later due to the saliva in the mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that logic wasn’t applicable to Su Tao, since he had years of experience in experimenting with medicine. Not to mention holding the alcohol in his mouth for ten minutes, he would be fine with even an entire day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something that only Su Tao could achieve, and this was considered his unique skill. Not only can he move freely with the alcohol in his mouth, but he could even speak. If he participated in any talent show with this skill, he could certainly get through it with flying colours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the red wine that contained the knockout drug flowed into Cao Jiaojiao’s mouth, she soon felt dizziness assaulting her brain before she became weak and her consciousness started to fade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knockout drugs were often mentioned in Wuxia novels, and the drug itself was created with datura, which can cause an obstruction in a person’s nervous system. There were already records of it being used to kill as early as the Song Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao wouldn’t take any action if no one made a move against him. If anyone makes a move at him, he would repay it tenfold!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he hadn’t woken up in time, he would’ve suffered a slap from Cao Jiaojiao. So while she still had a trace of consciousness left, he raised the hand that wasn’t injured and started slapping her ample buttocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The latter couldn’t resist, she could only suffer this grievance before closing her eyes that were filled with rage in reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Su Tao had his fun with slapping her, he started to feel that it was getting boring. Hence, he hurled her onto the bed and pondered how he should teach her a lesson.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman has been terribly spoiled and never placed anyone in her eyes. In her eyes, everyone was her plaything. So he had to teach her that in life, not everyone would endure her shit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pondering, he came to Cao Jiaojiao and pulled down her low-collared shirt a little more. Although Cao Jiaojiao did not have a ridiculous bust-size, she had an ample shape due to her bra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With another brief hesitation, Su Tao pulled her trousers down a few inches and exposed her navel before retrieving his phone and took a few photos of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao might be hateful, but she was truly blessed in her looks. She laid on the bed with her hair scattered and her eyes closed. There was a slight tan, yet healthy gloss to her skin that made her look sexy in her leather clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s already so bewitching at barely twenty… Just how many men will bow down to her skirt in the future?” Su Tao sighed. After a brief hesitation, he decided to take a few large-scale photos. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be possible for him to intimidate this lass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But as he took photos, he noticed a fire burning within his heart. At this moment, he discovered that there was actually a demon hidden within his heart. So it turned out that he was also fond of taking photos of someone unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After stripping Cao Jiaojiao down to her underwear, Su Tao managed to hold himself back and did not take it another step further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roughly an hour later, Cao Jiaojiao felt a pain-splitting headache as she regained her consciousness while rubbing her forehead. She suddenly recalled what had happened and exclaimed in shock. She immediately pulled the white blanket on the bed and covered her chest. Her clothes were scattered all around and she subconsciously glanced down her body before feeling relieved. There wasn’t any discomfort, nor was there any blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you do to me?” Cao Jiaojiao asked. But the moment she did, she felt that her words were foolish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was initially trying to plot against Su Tao. But not only did he not fall for it, but she was the one that was suffering instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. I do not have a hint of interest with your body.” After a brief pause, Su Tao smiled. “Well, I just took a few photos while you were asleep. Do you want to take a look and admire my technique?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Cao Jiaojiao’s body trembled, she questioned, “Do you know what you’re doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how could Su Tao be fazed by her threat? He came to her and clicked onto his album and started scrolling through the photos. Looking at the pictures, Cao Jiaojiao’s face paled from the anger. Initially, Su Tao was still worried that she wouldn’t be bothered with these photos, but he could tell that she was still a virgin. So despite her extrovert character and doing things arrogantly, she naturally felt fear when facing these photos of exposing nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t believe that you would dare to distribute those photos!” Cao Jiaojiao wanted to snatch the phone over, but she felt powerless due to the knockout drug still lingering within her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re right, and I don’t intend to share these photos. I just want to have them for my own admiration. But I believe that there’s a video that you might be interested in.” Su Tao retrieved the video that captured the beginning of Cao Jiaojiao entering the room till Su Tao was knocked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The video was accurately cut at the point when Cao Jiaojiao’s hand was about to slap his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a well-schemed trap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Jiaojiao widened her mouth as she looked at Su Tao in innocence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Letting out a sigh, Su Tao said, “I think it will be interesting if I send this video to your father!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re too treacherous!” Cao Jiaojiao trembled with her face drained of colour. She realised that Su Tao was too shrewd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being older, Rui Han was akin to a student, while Su Tao was a doctorate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rui Han fell for her trap, but on the other hand, not only did she fail with Su Tao, she even fell for his trap. It was simply humiliation to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was mainly because Cao Jiaojiao had no understanding of Su Tao. He has always been the one scheming against others. So how could he allow himself to be plotted against by someone else?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I admit defeat. I surrender.” The brim of Cao Jiaojiao’s eyes turned red as tears rolled down her cheeks. At this moment, she looked pitiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not a soft-hearted person, and this technique of yours is useless against me!” Su Tao poked through Cao Jiaojiao’s act. She was too tender to mess with him, and he only brought out half of his abilities today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want, then?! Do you really want to go against me?!” Cao Jiaojiao gnashed her teeth as the pitiful look from a moment ago disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not trying to go against you, but you’re the one messing around with me, time and time again.” Su Tao shrugged as he returned to the chair. “To prevent you from bothering me again, we have to reach an agreement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What agreement?” Cao Jiaojiao mocked in disdain, “Sure, I’ll agree to anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Su Tao not know what’s going through Cao Jiaojiao’s mind? She was just trying to compromise for the time being before coming back at him again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a smile, he had a full grasp on Cao Jiaojiao’s thoughts. Walking to her, he pinched her mouth and Cao Jiaojiao felt that her mouth was covered in a fishy smell. When Su Tao gently tapped on her throat, a pellet went down her throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m just asking you for fun. Did you really think that you’re qualified to negotiate with me?” Su Tao moved closer to Cao Jiaojiao’s ears and whispered, “Alright, since we’ve reached an agreement, then I’m your boss in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boss?!” Cao Jiaojiao felt a surge of disgust in her abdomen with her mouth filled with a fishy taste. Although she wanted to vomit, she couldn’t vomit anything out. “What did you just feed me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Special medicine.” Su Tao smiled. “Now, you will need an antidote from me annually, or you will die from the poison.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a joke!” Cao Jiaojiao sneered in disdain. “Are you treating me like a child?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, you can try pressing two centimetres beneath your right chest.” Su Tao casually responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following his instruction, Cao Jiaojiao gently pressed on that spot, which she soon felt a bone-piercing pain spreading throughout her body. Since young, she has never felt such excruciating pain before. She started to scream, just as Su Tao had expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you do not receive my antidote, that will be the pain you will suffer when the poison breaks out!” Su Tao walked over to Cao Jiaojiao and gently massaged her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being only a dozen seconds, that pain was etched into her heart and she could never forget it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao again, Cao Jiaojiao’s gaze underwent a drastic change. There wasn’t any of the arrogance and pride from before. It was replaced with fear, which he couldn’t help feeling prideful that he managed to tame this little demoness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing a gentle princess like Shui Junzhuo, he had to be a gentleman — a knight in shining armour. But dealing with a spoiled princess like Cao Jiaojiao, you have to be a thug. Otherwise, she would never put you in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Call me boss!” Su Tao tried to test the effect of his intimidation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boss!” Cao Jiaojiao called out in grievance with tears rolling down her cheeks and dampened the blanket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head in satisfaction, Su Tao caressed Cao Jiaojiao’s brown hair as if he was patting a pet. With a sinister smile spreading on his lips, he replied, “Not bad. Seeing that you’re so obedient, I’ll promise to send you the antidote every year before the poison breaks out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, boss.” Cao Jiaojiao was truly terrified by the earlier excruciating experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pointing at the clothes disarrayed on the floor, Su Tao instructed, “Wear your clothes and leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Su Tao, Cao Jiaojiao thought of how Su Tao probably saw everything when she was unconscious earlier. Hence, she had no guard against him and wore her clothes. However, she felt depressed. Although Su Tao has been looking at her during the entire process, there weren’t any emotions in his eyes. There wasn’t any reaction that a man ought to have for a woman, which made her feel discouraged.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Do I not possess any charm?</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sitting in the cab, Cao Jiaojiao felt her emotions being suppressed. Just as Su Tao had expected, she was a pampered girl. The reason why she suffered so greatly was due to her IQ being suppressed. Whether it was for the antidote or her pride, she would definitely not tell her family about this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her first response was to do a checkup first thing tomorrow to check if there’s any poison in her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Cao Jiaojiao’s attitude towards Su Tao has changed in her heart. This was the first man who managed to suppress her in every factor since young, and thinking about it again; he did seem pretty manly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But if Su Tao knew about her thoughts at this moment, he would surely be terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fishy pellet that Su Tao fed Cao Jiaojiao was a Fish Oil Pellet. Not only was it not a poison, but it was a nourishing medicine. But nourishing drugs were differentiated in terms of constitutions. For Cao Jiaojiao, who was suffering from Yin-Yang imbalance, the pellet wouldn’t immediately dissolve after entering her stomach, and pressing at her Zhongting Acupoint at that moment would cause intense pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that she would temporarily fall for it, but he was only trying to hold the advantage in their conversation to tell her that he wasn’t someone to mess around with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Cao Jiaojiao’s revealing photos, Su Tao only took a glance at them before he deleted them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was just a spoiled girl, and she wasn’t qualified to occupy his photo album.</span></p>
