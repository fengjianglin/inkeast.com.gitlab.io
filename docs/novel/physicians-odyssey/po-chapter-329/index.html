 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving a scolding from the boss, the security manager of the arcade could only swallow this matter up. Half an hour later, a lady dressed in a leather shirt and trousers walked in, chewing on a piece of chewing gum that emitted squishing sounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name of the boss was Zhong Ying, and he’s thirty-five this year. Despite being a figure in Minzhou City, he had to be courteous and respectful before this lady who seemed to be barely in her twenties with a fawning smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big Sister, why are you here?” Zhong Ying wiped the sweat on his forehead. “We just apologised to that bunch of people as per your instructions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it if it’s settled!” The woman took a napkin as she spat the chewing gum before throwing it into the rubbish bin. “Salted Fish, get up. It’s nothing serious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The security manager’s nickname was Salted Fish, and he knew that this woman was the backing for the arcade. Hence, he weakly said, “I’m innocent! That brat came to cause trouble in the arcade, and I came forth to stop him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Patting Salted Fish’s shoulder, the woman comforted, “Don’t worry about it, I know! That brat is currently treating my grandfather, but if he was someone else, I would definitely not let him walk out of the arcade!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I see!” Salted Fish instantly had a flash about this incident and understood why the fearless Missy of the Cao Family would take a step back with this outsider.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking out her purse from the bag, she took out a stack of cash and asked, “Are the brothers injured? Take this money and send them to the hospital. If there is excess, then buy some nourishment supplements. If it’s not enough, get Old Zhong to spend it from the profits of the arcade. No matter what, the brothers can’t be mistreated!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Big Sister!” Salted Fish’s tiny eyes instantly narrowed into slits from his smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This arcade was a business that the Missy of the Cao Family created at her leisure. As someone who loves to play, she gathered a few friends and invested in an arcade. So this arcade was actually created by the second generation riches. It wasn’t necessary if the arcade could bring in benefits, but their reputation was on the line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Missy of the Cao Family had a strong code of brotherhood, and the goons all felt at ease following her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After appeasing everyone, the woman came to the security room and unhappily called Cao Huaiqing’s phone, “Dad, I’ve dealt with it. But I’ll tell you beforehand. If that fellow can’t treat my grandfather’s illness, then I will give him ten slaps!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Jiaojiao, don’t mess around!” Cao Huaiqing was helpless with this rebellious daughter of his. “No matter what, he’s a guest of ours!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But he caused my friends to be beaten! If I don’t seek justice for them, I won’t be able to swallow this grudge!” Cao Jiaojiao was fuming with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re just a bunch of trash in the society!” Cao Huaiqing continued in a solemn tone, “I have told you many times not to create trouble outside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How am I creating trouble? I’m having a venture with my friends!” Cao Jiaojiao explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s plain nonsense!” Cao Huaiqing grew unhappy at his daughter’s words. “I’ve been busy recently, and I even have to take care of your grandfather, so I don’t have the time to bother about you. After I’m done with my stuff, I will arrange for you to go abroad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve told you many times that I’m not going abroad!” The brim of Cao Jiaojiao’s eyes turned red. That was how her father has always been, and he would always make decisions for her regardless of her feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is already decided!” Cao Huaiqing hung up the call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Cao Jiaojiao stored her phone, she kicked towards a wall. Although her heels created a hole in the wall, she also suffered the rebound and was in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kneeling on the ground, Cao Jiaojiao buried her face into her knees and briefly sobbed before she slowly raised her head. Although her eyes were still flickering with tears, her pupils were bright. Wiping the tears off the corner of her eyes, she walked into the surveillance room and instructed, “I want to see the surveillance at the claw machine earlier!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please wait!” The security guard knew that Cao Jiaojiao was the real boss. Hence, he immediately retrieved the footage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Cao Jiaojiao watched the entire footage seriously, she was taken aback. Su Tao’s performance at guiding Shui Junzhuo was simply brilliant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So I’ve misunderstood him.” Cao Jiaojiao had asked Salted Fish, and there wasn’t an issue with the claw machine. There’s only one explanation — they relied on their own capability to catch those plushies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What an interesting fellow!” Cao Jiangjing held her chin as curiosity piqued in her heart.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Ah Jun followed the two of them from afar, Su Tao could feel himself being spectated despite the former’s faint presence. Hence, he didn’t dare to be more fearless. Take the arcade episode as an example; he had the opportunity to be bolder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But overall, Su Tao was confident that Shui Junzhuo’s heart had been shaken and she was closer to him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want to have a cup of tea in my room?” Su Tao chuckled as he threw out an invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No need, I’m exhausted. So I want to tuck in early!” Shui Junzhuo rejected Su Tao’s malicious invitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shui Junzhuo entered her room, Su Tao sighed. Being with Shui Junzhuo gave him a unique feeling, unlike the other girls. It was an unprecedented motivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shui Junzhuo had a gentle nature, but her confidence and pride originated from deep down in her bones. Standing beside a girl like her, who received an excellent education, he would subconsciously pay attention to his own actions and conceal the rogue behaviour in his heart to be a gentleman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the International Medical Summit ended, Su Tao had never taken a rest. Although he made an outstanding performance in South Korea, his nerves were constantly tense. So when Su Tao showered, he laid down on the bed and slept. Perhaps knowing that Ah Jun would be protecting Shui Junzhuo, and look after him while he’s at it, Su Tao went into a deep sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At about 6 a.m., Su Tao was shaken awake by the doorbell. After he gently patted on his cheeks, he opened the door and saw a well-dressed Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing?” Su Tao was taken aback by her appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Following you to look for the Cloud Grass!” Shui Junzhuo said with resolute words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So this is the reason why you wanted to tuck in immediately after returning?” Su Tao helplessly asked as he subconsciously adjusted his messy hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I’m afraid that you might leave me behind and sneak away.” Shui Junzhuo smiled. “Don’t worry about it; I won’t drag you down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have you asked Sire Shui?” Su Tao felt that it was really tough trying to persuade Shui Junzhuo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yeah, I did! Uncle Jun will be coming with us!” Shui Junzhuo’s reply left Su Tao heartbroken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Letting out a sigh, Su Tao smiled. “Alright, then. With Ah Jun around, then I will have no worries to gather herbs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Ah Jun’s help, their journey in Sichuan Province would be smoother. When the Cao Family heard that Su Tao wanted to find herbs for Sire Cao in a mountain, they immediately dispatched a military aircraft. So two hours later, the three of them arrived in Sichuan Province with a vehicle escorting them to Miao Village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao returned, the Second Uncle, Miao Zhongtian, was excited. He pulled Su Tao and talked endlessly. Chinese New Year was just recently, and the town had already dispatched an investigation team for road building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Miao Village was remotely located, the cost of building a road was high, and the town suggested to make a simple construct first. As for asphalting the road, it took too much time and too many resources, so it had to be delayed for a few years. For the time being, they could only afford the cheapest sandstone road. But even so, Miao Village rejoiced at the news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao knew that it wouldn’t be easy to find the Cloud Grass, and he needed a guide. So he pulled Miao Zhongtian towards the corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing that Su Tao had something to ask of him, Miao Zhongtian’s expression turned solemn as he said, “Divine Physician Su, you’re the benefactor of our entire village. You can go straight into the topic, and if I can help you in any way, I will definitely do my best!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll not beat around the bush, then. I’m here to look for a nearly extinct herb, and it’s called Cloud Grass. Back then, I found some Cloud Grass in the bag of herbs that Big Sister Li Hua gave me, so I’m certain that is Cloud Grass on this mountain!” Letting out a sigh, Su Tao continued, “But I’ve gone up the mountain twice, and I couldn’t find a trace of it! I have a patient in Minnan Province that urgently requires this herb. So I have to make a trip into the mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see!” Miao Zhongtian finally understood why someone from the city like Su Tao would want to invest in such a remote village like Miao Village. For this matter, he even tried asking Fan Lihua about it privately, but her lips were tight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Miao Zhongtian had a barrier in his heart. After all, Su Tao was an outsider, and he was afraid that Su Tao might do something unfavorable to the village despite what the latter has done so far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about this, I’ll find a guide for you!” Miao Zhongtian recalled someone and continued, “His name is Xu Dashan, and he’s the most familiar person in the village with the mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A guide?” Su Tao smiled. “That’s great!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after a brief pause, Miao Zhongtian showed an awkward smile and warned, “But that person is a little insane, and everyone calls him Madman Xu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is that?” Su Tao was perplexed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ten years ago, he found an egg-sized silver out of nowhere and felt that this mountain is a treasure trove. So he would make a monthly trip to the mountain.” Miao Zhongtian was a little embarrassed and worried that Su Tao might turn down his recommendation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you show me to him? I can tell if he’s really insane with a glance.” Su Tao had an intuition that there was something more to this story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Su Tao accepted his suggestion, Miao Zhongtian felt better. “I’ll bring Xu Dashan over right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour later, Miao Zhongtian brought Xu Dashan over. The latter’s clothes were ragged with his hair in a mess. He even had blotches on his skin, as if he hadn’t washed himself clean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his eyes were brilliant and had a slight limp in his foot. He should have sprained his ankle, but there wasn’t an issue with his mind.</span></p>
