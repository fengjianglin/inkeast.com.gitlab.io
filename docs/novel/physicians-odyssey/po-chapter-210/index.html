 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A silhouette fell in front of Jiang Qinghan as blood splattered. There were even several beads of blood splashed on her face that came from the wound that was initially aimed at her chest. At the same time, the eyes of the hitman were struck with two silver needles and he roared in pain. He started to randomly fire bullets. On the other hand, Jiang Qinghan embraced that silhouette and she fired a shot that accurately hit the forehead of the hitman, killing him instantly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene continuously looped in Jiang Qinghan’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lovers would often ask each other if they would take a bullet for one another, but Jiang Qinghan never expected that there would really be someone willing to take a shot for her. He’s not her lover, and she had just started to know him, a disciple of hers that she didn’t have any emotional attachment to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Jiang Qinghan knew that her attitude had changed towards Su Tao in that instant. Only after experiencing a trial of life and death can a relationship be sturdy and establish trust.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked at the sickbed, where Su Tao was lying with his arm wrapped in bandages. She was dazed. She never expected that Su Tao would take a bullet for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao didn’t suffer any substantial injuries, only suffering a bullet in his scapula, which had been removed. He only needed rest to swiftly recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you thinking?” Su Tao grabbed a tangerine with the hand that wasn’t injured and threw it over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Catching the tangerine, Jiang Qinghan responded, “I’m thinking about why you took a bullet for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you touched?” Su Tao asked as he sighed, “I’m also feeling fearful right now. Back then, I had no idea what I was doing. I never expected that I, a Physician, would by lying in a sickbed as a patient. Isn’t that hilarious?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan peeled the tangerine then placed it beside Su Tao. “I never expected that the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company would be so insane. They even wanted to claim the lives of Old Zhang and me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nitta Watanabe was also terrified out of his wits by this incident and is preparing to leave for Japan as soon as possible. I’m afraid that he won’t be a witness for you to testify suspects.” Su Tao placed a piece of tangerine in his mouth and his mouth was instantly covered with sweet juice. Jiang Qinghan did not remove the pith. This was the proper way of preparing it. The pith actually has medicinal worth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan deeply sighed, then she responded, “The hitmen were taken away by the State Security Ministry. I recognised two of them. They’re heavily wanted fugitives in Interpol. The Cambell Pharmaceutical Company has paid such a great price to kill me, and that’s one more reason why I can’t give up now. I must go through with it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao sighed at Jiang Qinghan’s stubbornness. Although this woman wasn’t gentle, cute, or threw a tantrum, she had her own judgment that would attract the admiration of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few contacts with the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company, Su Tao gained a brief understanding of this underground syndicate, and Jiang Qinghan trying to investigate them was akin to an ant trying to shake a tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was shocking that the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company would resort to such means for their objectives. Just imagine how arrogant and resourceful they must be to be able to dispatch hitmen in the hospital to erase the evidence. At the same time, he’s also worried about Jiang Qinghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door was knocked and Zhang Zhen entered with a swollen face. He cursed, “That bastard, Yang Wei, has escaped. This time, we were almost done in by him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The injury on Zhang Zhen’s face was done by Yang Wei, and he had fainted during the gunfight, so he did not witness the entire process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll pay more attention in the future. Yang Wei’s family circumstances are ordinary, so it’s not surprising that the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company would try to bribe him. Actually, he’s an outstanding officer, and if he hadn’t gone down the crooked path, his future would have been bright.” Exhaustion flashed in Jiang Qinghan’s eyes. She had also suffered light injuries from the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it wasn’t as depressing the betrayal of a fellow teammate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What should we do now?” Zhang Zhen asked with a solemn expression. The attitude of this senior officer comforted Jiang Qinghan’s heart a little. At least there’s still someone willing to stand by her side, even now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll drill in from Brother Black to locate the Underground Research Facility at Jidong Province.” Jiang Qinghan said in a firm tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Jiang Qinghan still wanted to dip into this matter, Su Tao asked, “The evidence that you’ve gathered so far isn’t enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan shook her head. “The Cambell Pharmaceutical Company is extremely cunning, and their Underground Research Facilities are all covered up as illegal workshops. So even if we find them, we won’t be able to link them to the company. Even if we bring one down, there would be a second and third facility emerging…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Actually, there’s a method to hit all the Underground Research Facilities at once.” Su Tao glanced at the bandage on his arm, then continued, “Just directly strike the roots. The moment the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company is in trouble, their support to the Underground Research Facilities would be cut off, so just sweep them up after that. If you don’t do this, the fire will just endlessly blaze.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Without any evidence to prove that the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company and the Underground Research Facilities are related, everything will just be our speculation.” Zhang Zhen helplessly said as he rubbed his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It doesn’t have to be the Underground Research Facilities. Just try and kick the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company out of China.” Su Tao responded. Zhang Zhen and Jiang Qinghan still couldn’t understand the idea that he suggested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Qinghan knitted her brows and pondered for a long time before she finally figured out Su Tao’s idea. “You’re saying to investigate whether the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company has any problems with their economy or other matters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao smiled. “Yeah, the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company is smart. Since they dare to spread their net around the country, then they must be prepared. So even if you dig out their Underground Research Facilities, it’s impossible to shake their foundation. Why not change to another angle and see if the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company has broken the law. It’d be easier that way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your idea is fresh and out of the box. If we stick to our method, it will surely come to a dead end.” Jiang Qinghan felt hesitant before she continued, “But we’re Criminal Investigation Officers, isn’t it out of our jurisdiction to investigate the Cambell Pharmaceutical Company’s operation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys came from Hanzhou City to Qiongjin City. Isn’t it already out of your jurisdiction?” Su Tao’s words made Jiang Qinghan and Zhang Zhen smile in relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sometimes, people would feel extremely exhausted when they’ve committed all the effort, but they couldn’t achieve the effect that they wanted. Actually, it’s not that they’re not working hard enough, it’s that they’ve picked the wrong direction and method. Some people treated life and death as a multiple-choice question; success or failure were just choices. Most successful people might not be outstanding in terms of their ability, but they’re more meticulous when it came to making a choice, when compared to others.</span></p>
 <hr>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hans smashed three glasses, making a mess on the superior-quality carpet. The secretary standing beside him was covered in sweat out of fear that he might anger his boss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did you people do things? We’ve sent out five hitmen, but we can’t even deal with two loathsome officers?” Hans hollered as he waved his hand, revealing the impatience in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry. I’ve just received news that the hitmen were actually able to kill Jiang Qinghan, but someone interfered and ruined our plan.” The secretary cautiously responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interfered?” Hans flipped the small desk and asked, “Who?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s Su Tao, that person who ruined our placenta research facility.” The secretary pushed all the blame onto the unforeseen event to alleviate Hans’ anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have some impression of that person. It’s that physician?” Hans panted as he sat down on the couch to calm his emotions before continuing, “He ruined my plans numerous times. Go and search for all the information related to him. I want him to pay the price for being foolish!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the secretary finally found a scapegoat, he felt inwardly relieved before asking, “Right, what should we do about the mole we planted beside Jiang Qinghan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where is he?” Hans coldly said, then held his chin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The secretary pointed at the door and said, “He has a few matters regarding Jiang Qinghan that he wishes to tell you personally.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold light flickered in Hans’s eyes and he faintly said, “Holler him in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yang Wei tried to remain calm as he walked in. Hans stood up and gave a gentlemanly handshake. “Officer Yang, we met again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yang Wei shook hands with Hans and smiled. “Mr. Hans, I believe you know my current situation. So I need your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lighting up a cigar, Hans took two puffs before saying, “Officer Yang, our cooperation has already come to an end. When you gave me the last lead, I’ve already transferred you ¥200,000. You can make a check.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yang Wei’s face turned ugly before he lowered his voice, “Hans, I’ve become a fugitive after providing information to you. Not only have I lost my job, I even have to change my identity. ¥200,000 isn’t enough!”</span></p>
