 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the time, men call a woman stupid with a pampering mentality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because they feel that the woman is stupid, which was why they wanted to protect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Men think that women weren’t smart, and they’re stupid because they hope that they could be their support and shelter them from the storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Su Tao felt that Shui Junzhuo was stupid, he had already fallen into this phenomenon, which he had just yet to notice that he already had feelings for the princess of the Shui Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the person involved wouldn’t know it himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He only knew that being together with Shui Junzhuo felt blissful, despite spending their day without any special events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whenever Shui Junzhuo looks at him, he would feel especially satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished his dinner with Shui Junzhuo, it was already 10 p.m., which Shui Junzhuo sent Su Tao back home before she left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao blankly stared at the Havel, disappearing into the night, before he returned to his apartment, where he was surprised when he went up and saw a note near the lock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m your neighbor, and I have something urgent! Call me when you’re back, my mobile number is 158XXX0673!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Su Tao tried to give the number a call, there wasn’t any response from the other side, but when he took out his keys and wanted to open the door, he heard a commotion from the apartment next door and the door opened with Gu Rushan’s head popping out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry, I was showering, so I didn’t pick up your phone. Give me five minutes!” When she finished, she returned to her apartment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao was wondering if she ran to the door butt naked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just as Su Tao had guessed. Gu Rushan was showering earlier, and she didn’t even have the time to wash the bubbles off her body. But due to her anxiousness when she closed the door, she slipped and fell on the ground with her tailbone aching from the impact with the cold, hard floor before she gritted the pain and walked into the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the pain, she was in a good mood and chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just ten-odd minutes ago, she received a call from the production team of the drama, Huadu’s Green Wine, that she was chosen for the role, and she would be a member of the acting crew starting tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, after so many years, she has waited for this opportunity, which she knew that it was all due to Ni Jingqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ni Jingqiu was the sponsor of this drama, and the message that she gave out without realising that they were friends naturally made the production team consider her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But after sorting out the logic, Gu Rushan still had to ultimately thank Su Tao for this opportunity. If they didn’t jog together and Su Tao saved Ni Jingqiu’s boyfriend, how would she be so lucky?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, Ni Jingqiu wanted to meet Su Tao, which Gu Rushan wanted to talk with the latter and wanted him to act as her boyfriend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if she knew that she’s putting Su Tao in a difficult position, she didn’t have a choice since she has waited for years for this chance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After washing the soap and bubbles on her body, Gu Rushan initially wanted to bear the pain and wear her underwear. However, she had no idea if she had injured herself earlier, since she couldn’t feel a thing on her butt! After trying for a long time, she ultimately gave up and draped a singlet over before adding thick pajamas so that she wouldn’t expose herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Limping her way to the door, Gu Rushan took her phone and gave Su Tao a call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief moment, Su Tao came out and locked his door before heading over next door. He then looked at Gu Rushan with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing his gaze, Gu Rushan felt a little baffled. Could it be that she has accidentally exposed herself? She immediately covered her chest and blushed as she pointed at the couch with a smile. “Come in and have a seat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She still had a white towel wrapped around her head and was wearing winter pajamas with a low collar. Although she wore something inside, she still revealed a large patch of skin with droplets dripping down her sideburns. Evidently, she showered in a hurry and still hadn’t dried herself. Her pajamas were long and stretched down to her knees, covering her thighs. Although her appearance seemed casual, there was a special charm that radiated from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was mainly due to her delicate features that could fuel the imagination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had an oval-shaped face, so her face was giving off a radiance since she had just showered. Her brows were akin to two crescent moons with eyes like limpid autumn water and delicate rosy lips, which she looked like a charming yet seductive rose under the dusky lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was showering earlier, and when I wanted to pick up the phone, you’ve already hung it.” Gu Rushan looked at Su Tao with an apologetic gaze. She got Su Tao to walk first so that he wouldn’t notice her unusual posture due to the pain on her butt, since it was too bashful for her to tell Su Tao about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this was also because she had been independent for a long time, building her strong character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Su Tao was a little absent-minded. After all, it was ambiguous for him to enter the apartment of a woman who was still considered a stranger in the middle of the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, what is it?” Su Tao looked down and looked at the pair of pearly feet that were painted with nail polish, looking eye-catchy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s like this…” Gu Rushan sat on the couch and furrowed her brows from the pain as beads of sweat appeared on her forehead. “Do you still remember the incident this morning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about it?” Su Tao’s gaze was on Gu Rushan’s waist. He was certain that Gu Rushan must have suffered an injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he entered, his gaze had already wandered around Gu Rushan’s body. Although it seemed rude, it was an occupational habit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through his observation, he noticed that Gu Rushan had suffered quite a severe injury on her butt, which he inwardly praised her for her endurance and that she managed to remain calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I…” But just when Gu Rushan wanted to speak, Su Tao gently waved his hand and interrupted, “Don’t be in such a rush to explain. Did you fall earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan was briefly stunned before she nodded her head. “Yeah, I was careless earlier and slipped. But there’s no big deal about it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shaking his head, Su Tao sighed, “It’s not a small problem. If I’ve not guessed wrongly, you should’ve injured your muscles and bones, and if you don’t treat it in time now, you won’t even be able to get up tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That serious?” Gu Rushan was startled by Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m a physician, and I’m not scaring you.” Su Tao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After linking Su Tao’s words to the incident this morning with how he saved Ni Jingqiu’s boyfriend, Gu Rushan’s eyes flickered and she figured out that it wasn’t a coincidence. It was no wonder why Ni Jingqiu was so grateful to Su Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As her face blushed, she sighed, “So, what should I do? Do you have any treatment for it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nodding his head, Su Tao coughed, “I do, but you won’t like it. I only have to massage the injury.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way!” Gu Rushan immediately replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A man and woman alone in an apartment as he massaged her butt. It’d be weird if nothing happened!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Gu Rushan was more conservative than he had imagined, Su Tao inwardly admired her and he smiled. “Don’t worry about it, I was just scaring you. We don’t have to do that. Lie down on the couch and don’t move; I’ll be back shortly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Gu Rushan briefly waited, Su Tao carried his medical box over and noticed the relief in Gu Rushan’s eyes. He inwardly sighed. This woman probably thought that he was trying to take advantage of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan’s injury was more severe than he had imagined. She had injured her muscles and bones, and if he had speculated correctly, there were even signs of a hairline fracture. So it would be inhumane if he tried to take advantage of her at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Apply the medicine yourself, and apply it on where it hurts at a four-hour interval. Remember to set an alarm clock, since you have to apply it once more in the middle of the night!” Su Tao took out a bottle of ointment meant for external injury and explained, “When applying, do keep in mind the method. You can’t use force to rub it, you have to apply it evenly, and you can only wear your clothes after it cools down and the medicine is fully absorbed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Rushan nodded her head as she blushed. She liked to sleep naked, so there’s no issue with clothes. But it’s undoubtedly torture for her to wake up in the middle of the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it really that serious? Is there another faster method?” Gu Rushan asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tao nodded his head and replied, “Of course there is! I’m a physician, and I know a few massage techniques that can aid the absorption of the medicine. So I can apply the medicine for you once, and you will recover fully tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Gu Rushan gnashed her teeth, she was hesitating if she should trust Su Tao due to the pain on her butt. She was in a dilemma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing her reaction, Su Tao naturally knew that Gu Rushan was suspecting his identity, but there was nothing strange about it, since he only knew her for a day. Thus, he placed the bottle of ointment on the desk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll leave the ointment here, and you have to remember to put it on!” Su Tao helplessly sighed as he headed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait!” Gu Rushan still hadn’t finished speaking about her matter, so why was Su Tao leaving?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong? You need my help?” Su Tao turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s not it, I called you here to discuss something, and I’m not done yet. Why are you leaving?” Despite her words, her eyes were still on the bottle of ointment. She was hesitating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, go on with it!” Su Tao reminded, “But I suggest you put the medicine on quickly so that your injury can heal faster!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you pretend to be my boyfriend?” Gu Rushan softly begged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Su Tao never expected such a melodramatic plot would happen to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Should he agree or refuse?</span></p>
