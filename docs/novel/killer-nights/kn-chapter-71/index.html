 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 71: An Old Newcomer</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao put down her phone and turned around to order a bowl of hand-cut noodles for Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;She believed he was smart enough to figure out that she was at Uncle Cai’s noodle shop. &nbsp;These days, the noodle shop was no longer the sleepy joint that it’d been just a few months ago. &nbsp;Because of Uncle Cai’s honest and friendly personality, not to mention the excellent quality of his noodles, this hole-in-the-wall restaurant was almost always packed with customers during mealtime. &nbsp;As a result, Uncle Cai no longer had time to come out of the kitchen to engage in the lengthy chats with A-Jiao like the way he used to. &nbsp;In addition, he’d hired a server, an elderly gentleman named Gao, to take care of the customers. &nbsp;This Gao was the very same person whom Uncle Cai had introduced to A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai as an old buddy of his, the last time they’d been there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Uncle Gao!” A-Jiao affectionately thanked the old man as he brought out the food A-Jiao had ordered for Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re welcome!” the old man crisply replied. &nbsp;His accent was noticeably different from Uncle Cai’s. &nbsp;Unless you really had an ear for accents, you would think he was a native of this city. &nbsp;Also, this old man was physically different from other elderly persons. &nbsp;His body was noticeably studier than others of his age. &nbsp;You could definitely describe his physique as being big-boned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Gao, are you a local?” A-Jiao asked him out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, no,” Gao quickly answered. &nbsp;“I--” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the old man could continue, a customer at another table called out, “Big Uncle, check please!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man immediately answered, “Be right there!” &nbsp;He looked at A-Jiao apologetically before hurrying off to get the other customer his check.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, I’ve got you!” &nbsp;As soon as the old man left her table, Jiang Zhengkai walked in from outside. He put his hands above his head like rabbit ears and made a funny face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you, three?” A-Jiao asked sarcastically. &nbsp;Although her words sounded like a reprimand, her tone was one of love and affection. &nbsp;She also couldn’t help but laugh when she saw the way he looked. &nbsp;“Here, go ahead and start eating. &nbsp;I already ordered for you. &nbsp;It arrived just before you did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are so many people here today!” Jiang Zhengkai casually remarked as he took a look around the restaurant. &nbsp;“How come you didn’t call me during the day?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha! &nbsp;Wouldn’t you get annoyed with me if I called you everyday?” asked A-Jiao as she played with her chopsticks. &nbsp;“I heard that men find clingy women to be very annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true,” Jiang Zhengkai replied without thinking. &nbsp;Little did he think that A-Jiao’s retaliation would come so swiftly. &nbsp;She immediately reached out her hand and twisted his ear. &nbsp;“You don’t want to live anymore, do you? &nbsp;How dare you call me annoying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! &nbsp;No way! &nbsp;I’m sorry!” laughed Jiang Zhengkai as he grabbed onto A-Jiao’s extended hand. &nbsp;Her hand felt so very soft in his, and she wasn’t really using that much force when twisting his ear. &nbsp;“I’ll never find you annoying,” he said as he continued to hold her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! &nbsp;Don’t even think about it!” snapped A-Jiao as she pulled back her hand. &nbsp;“And stop touching my hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, hehe!” chuckled Jiang Zhengkai as he looked at her expression. &nbsp;He was suddenly reminded of the girl who’d sat on that hospital bed and wanted to give him five yuan in change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh right, Ziyuan, do you know a girl named A-Ju?” Jiang Zhengkai asked A-Jiao as he rapidly shoved the noodles into his mouth. &nbsp;A-Jiao had already finished eating, so she was attentively watching Jiang Zhengkai eat his meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I don’t,” A-Jiao shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about A-Sha?” continued Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her?” asked A-Jiao with a look of disdain. &nbsp;“What a coward! &nbsp;What, did she…” &nbsp;A-Jiao paused for a moment before continuing in a lower voice, “Did she die, too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, no,” replied Jiang Zhengkai with a smile. &nbsp;Due to his frequent encounters with dead bodies, Jiang Zhengkai was obviously desensitized to people dying. &nbsp;If there weren’t so many murders in this world, what need would it have for homicide detectives like Jiang Zhengkai?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that’s good,” remarked A-Jiao, before she returned to playing with her chopsticks. &nbsp;However, her eyelashes flashed again and again. &nbsp;Obviously, something was on her mind. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai noticed the non-verbal tell, but decided not to ask A-Jiao anything. &nbsp;His years of being an investigative police officer hds taught him that in situations such as these, it was better to observe than to question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Jiang Zhengkai finished eating his noodles, A-Jiao called for the check from Uncle Gao. &nbsp;Now that Uncle Cai’s business had exploded, it was no longer safe to leave the payment underneath the bowls. &nbsp;Besides, now that Uncle Cai was no longer functioning as a server, there was no need to worry about him not accepting their payment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a strapping young man!” Uncle Gao said casually as he glanced at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;Thank you for the compliment, Uncle Gao!” Jiang Zhengkai politely replied, before grabbing a hold of A-Jiao’s arm. &nbsp;“Alright, Uncle Gao, we’re going to head out now! &nbsp;Please send our regards to Uncle Cai. &nbsp;Take care!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where should we go now?” Jiang Zhengkai asked A-Jiao once they walked out of the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where else can we go?” she asked as an unhappy expression came across her face. &nbsp;“Obviously back to the preschool, because I’ve got night classes to teach!” &nbsp;And that was the truth. &nbsp;These days, A-Jiao’s free time was monopolized by either Jiang Zhengkai or by her preschool students. &nbsp;Where could she possibly find the time to go shopping or traveling?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I’ll go with you then!” said Jiang Zhengkai as he put his arm around her shoulder and started walking towards the preschool. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao, however, didn’t budge and stood there like a rock as she stared at him. &nbsp;“So you’ll come help teach my class with me?” &nbsp;She was obviously toying with Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;She knew his offer was to walk her to her preschool, not to help her teach her students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, lazy bum!” Jiang Zhengkai helplessly chuckled in response to A-Jiao’s request. &nbsp;A woman in love wants some sweetness, while a man in love wants to provide that sweet feeling to his woman. &nbsp;As a normal man, Jiang Zhengkai would obviously not just drop A-Jiao off and leave. &nbsp;“Fine! &nbsp;As long as the principal doesn’t mind, I’ll help you teach your class,” Jiang Zhengkai said warmly as he stroked A-Jiao’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sounds good! &nbsp;I’m sure she won’t complain!” &nbsp;A-Jiao placed her head on his arm. &nbsp;“Let’s go, Honey! &nbsp;By the way, the principal’s not there in the evenings. &nbsp;All I really do is instruct the children on how to draw.” &nbsp;The two of them marched in step, arm-in-arm, towards the preschool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The evening class wasn’t too boring for Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;Seeing the woman he loved teach a classroom full of children was also a kind of enjoyment. &nbsp;When a man and a woman first fall in love, they will very easily accept anything and everything from one another: the good, the bad, what they are used to, and what they aren’t used to. &nbsp;It’s only after the honeymoon period is over that conflicts start to arise…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In A-Jiao’s studio, besides Jiang Zhengkai, there were five or six children in attendance, along with their respective parents. &nbsp;He’d originally thought that because A-Jiao taught a preschool that all of her students would be young children. &nbsp;While most of A-Jiao’s students were indeed between the ages of three and seven, a few were older, middle school students even. &nbsp;They attended her class because they had a passion for painting. &nbsp;Plus, it wasn’t easy to find a good painting instructor, so parents naturally sent their children to A-Jiao’s class because she was one of the best in the city. &nbsp;That was why the ages of her students were all over the place. &nbsp;As long as A-Jiao had no objections, Principal Li didn’t mind either. &nbsp;What she wanted were results. &nbsp;As long as the students paid tuition and didn’t cause trouble in class, she could care less how old they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The parents started becoming more active when A-Jiao completed the lecture portion of her class and began the one-on-one tutoring portion. &nbsp;Many of them would gradually inch forward next to their children, as if they were afraid A-Jiao would forget to tutor their own children. &nbsp;It was at this point that Jiang Zhengkai became separated from the crowd. &nbsp;He didn’t have a child to look after. &nbsp;The only “child” he was keeping an eye on was the child in charge of the other children in the class: A-Jiao. &nbsp;However, at this particular moment, A-Jiao did not actually belong to him; rather, she belonged to the children under her instruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Zhengkai saw that the parents who had a second ago been sitting next to him had all left to join their children, he decided he would rather get up as well rather than sit alone by himself. &nbsp;He didn’t mingle with the parents, however. &nbsp;Instead, he walked over to the shelves that stored the paintings drawn by A-Jiao and her students. &nbsp;Last time, Jiang Zhengkai had taken advantage of the time A-Jiao had spent drawing to find a painting of the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, which allowed him to confirm that Ren Ziyuan was A-Jiao’s alter ego. &nbsp;This time, he planned to take advantage of the time she spent teaching to flip through her works again. &nbsp;Perhaps he could find among them even more surprising leads?</span></p>
