 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Inside her office, Dr. Wang motioned for Jiang Zhengkai to take a seat. &nbsp;She pushed up her glasses, which had slid down her nose, and gave him a serious look. &nbsp;“Officer Jiang, we’ve known each other for many years now. &nbsp;I’ve always thought you to be an upstanding person. Yet I heard you spent the night with the patient last night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I did,” Jiang Zhengkai replied, feeling a bit muddle-headed. &nbsp;Was she saying that A-Jiao had been violated in some way in the restroom?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard from the duty nurse that the two of you were in some kind of a scuffle last night?” Dr. Wang continued, still looking at him. &nbsp;“That bruise on her neck; that was because of you, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bruise? &nbsp;I… I only…” Jiang Zhengkai didn’t know what to say. &nbsp;He felt like a child who had been called to the principal’s office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you probably did it inadvertently,” Dr. Wang said, maintaining her stare. &nbsp;“But the patient is still very weak. &nbsp;Her body can’t take that kind of punishment. &nbsp;Furthermore, did you take her to eat hot pot today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did I not tell you to not let her eat anything that was hard to digest and to not let her eat too much at once?” admonished Dr. Wang. &nbsp;“Her body is not yet ready to ingest an unrestricted diet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I know I was wrong,” Jiang Zhengkai stammered. &nbsp;Dr. Wang had indeed reminded him of these dietary restrictions before, and during the meal, he did actually remember to pay attention to the restrictions. &nbsp;He didn’t think A-Jiao would have a problem, but she did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope you can set aside the patient’s profession and respect her as a person. &nbsp;Her current condition doesn’t require round-the-clock attention. &nbsp;If you’re that concerned for her safety, could the police bureau not assign a female police officer to watch over her?” Dr. Wang said imposingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah… I… I didn’t think it through. &nbsp;It’s mostly because… because I still have some questions that I wanted to clear up with her…” Jiang Zhengkai helplessly answered. “I… I’m very busy during the day, so…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Jiang, there are some things you have to put more thought into. &nbsp;Getting her a private bed, taking her out to dinner… &nbsp;Iif Commissioner Yao knew about this, what do you think the consequences would be? &nbsp;You wouldn’t want me to be in trouble either, would you?” sighed Dr. Wang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I know I was in the wrong,” nodded Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He saw the expression on Dr. Wang’s face had relaxed a bit, so he asked delicately, “Ah… about her current condition…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, she’s fine.” &nbsp;Now that Dr. Wang had finished what she’d wanted to say, she was no longer so serious. &nbsp;“It’s just that she had her period, and because she ate too much today, there was too much pressure on her uterus, which led to bleeding in her reproductive system. &nbsp;She lost a lot of blood during her earlier assault, so her blood level was already below normal. &nbsp;Therefore, the blood loss today led very quickly to a loss of consciousness. &nbsp;It was a good thing you got to her quickly; otherwise, she would’ve bled out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that means she’s not in any danger?” Jiang Zhengkai probed. &nbsp;It turned out it was just a false alarm, so his heart started to feel more at ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s out of danger,” said Dr. Wang. &nbsp;“From now on, follow my explicit instructions. &nbsp;Tell her to rest. &nbsp;Alright, I’m going home now.” &nbsp;With that, Dr. Wang stood up, turned around, and went inside the hospital personnel locker room to change out of her scrubs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Dr. Wang walked away, Jiang Zhengkai shook his shoulders and was finally able to relax. &nbsp;Just based on age, that old lady had more than enough years on him to give him a good lecturing. &nbsp;Worse, she was related to his boss, Yao Tianyu. &nbsp;Right now, he could only pray for Dr. Wang to not say anything to her brother-in-law. &nbsp;Otherwise, he would be in for a good bout of asschewing in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nevertheless, word still go out, probably because a gun had been pulled in a crowded downtown area. &nbsp;In the eyes of the Chinese public and media, any incident involving a firearm was no small matter. &nbsp;Therefore, that very evening, a swarm of journalists descended upon Hot Pot City. &nbsp;The next day, reports of Jiang Zhengkai’s heroics spread all over the morning news broadcasts. &nbsp;Soon, the entire city learned about how Officer Jiang, with gun drawn, had put his life on the line in order to protect the citizens of their city. &nbsp;Even though the televised news only sang Jiang Zhengkai’s praises, it wasn’t long before the truth of what had happened reached Yao Tianyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That afternoon, Jiang Zhengkai appeared in Yao Tianyu’s office. &nbsp;After a torrential asschewing in the form of a political indoctrination session was over, Jiang Zhengkai finally emerged from the office. &nbsp;At that moment, he finally understood something one of his seniors had told him: “Just because you see one of your bosses eating dinner with a prostitute doesn’t mean there’s something indecent going on. &nbsp;Sometimes, they’re just doing their job.” &nbsp;Unfortunately, the only prostitutes that this senior was going to hang out with were those living in the next world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result of this whole incident was that it kept Jiang Zhengkai a whole lot more honest. &nbsp;He no longer risked going to the hospital to see A-Jiao. &nbsp;Whether A-Jiao was feeling lonely at the moment was a question Jiang Zhengkai could no longer afford to answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao was out of it for an entire day, finally regaining consciousness the next evening. &nbsp;She opened her eyes just a crack and saw someone lying on the guest bed, so she called out softly, “Uncle Policeman… Officer Jiang, I want to drink some water…” &nbsp;Even though she was completely devoid of formality, she wasn’t in the habit of throwing around terms of endearment like “honey” or “baby.” &nbsp;Good thing, too, because if she had, she would’ve permanently destroyed Jiang Zhengkai’s career as a police officer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you thirsty?” came the voice of a young woman from the guest bed. &nbsp;“I’ll get you some water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, who are you?” A-Jiao feebly asked while lying on her bed. &nbsp;“Why isn’t Officer Jiang here attending to me tonight? &nbsp;Has there been another homicide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;My name is Wei Xin,” the young female police officer replied. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang assigned me to help take care of your personal needs for a while. &nbsp;If you have any leads, you can tell me, and I’ll forward them on to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.” &nbsp;A-Jiao closed her eyes once again. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>That damned flat-as-a-board assistant,</span></i><span style> she thought to herself. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Nobody wanted you here! &nbsp;Flat as a board! &nbsp;Flatboard…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Half a month quickly passed, and even though Jiang Zhengkai was able to gather a few leads, none of them panned out. &nbsp;The most promising lead of all was whatever Zhang Nan’s predecessor, Gao, had known about. &nbsp;But after Gao had retired, he’d gone back to his hometown and hadn’t left any contact information. &nbsp;Therefore, what could have potentially been the biggest lead in the case was left uncultivated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Any recent news from Zhang Nan?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai crossed off another day on his desk calender. &nbsp;“Half a month has passed. &nbsp;Still no activity in the alley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s correct, Inspector Jiang,” Wei Xin answered earnestly while standing in front of his desk. &nbsp;“Although, based on the frequency of the previous homicides, I predict we are soon due for another one.” &nbsp;If Wei Xin hadn’t studied criminal justice, Jiang Zhengkai thought she could’ve made for an excellent weather forecaster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then continue to pay attention to our surveillance efforts!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai rubbed a finger against his upper lip a few times. &nbsp;It was the only order he could think of to give to Wei Xin. &nbsp;This case was no joke, and assigning more police surveillance didn’t necessarily guarantee they would record the frightening scene he had witnessed last time. &nbsp;Therefore, they needed to maximize this opportunity! &nbsp;He raised his head and looked up at her. &nbsp;“So… that A-Jiao, how is she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She should be discharged from the hospital today,” Wei Xin replied. &nbsp;Ever since that incident at Hot Pot City, since Wei Xin was a fellow woman, she’d been given the responsibility of tending to A-Jiao in the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, well, I guess I’ll pay her a visit this afternoon.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai clasped his hands together and tapped them against the desk in an expression of uneasiness. &nbsp;“Alright, after she is discharged, you’ll still be in charge of keeping tabs on her. &nbsp;I believe she definitely knows something she isn’t telling us. &nbsp;More importantly, of all the people we’ve found, she had the closest relationship to A-Xiu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, Inspector Jiang,” Wei Xin straightforwardly accepted. &nbsp;“That woman... she’s not bad at heart, just went down the wrong path.” &nbsp;Wei Xin herself didn’t know where that last sentence came from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyway, you go see Sergeant Zhang right after lunch. &nbsp;I’ll join you there once I’m done at the hospital,” Jiang Zhengkai said as he stood up. &nbsp;“Let’s go! &nbsp;It’s lunchtime!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to discuss A-Jiao right now. &nbsp;After all, it hadn’t been very long since he’d had his ass chewed out by Yao Tianyu. &nbsp;Still, he had to goto the hospital, if for no other reason than he was personally responsible for the majority of A-Jiao’s hospital bill. &nbsp;He didn’t treat every suspect or witness this way, but he felt like he owed A-Jiao something. &nbsp;If he had treated A-Jiao like a normal woman, then perhaps the man who’d attacked her would be behind bars by now.</span></p>
