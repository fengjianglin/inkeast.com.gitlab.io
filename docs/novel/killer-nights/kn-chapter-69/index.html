 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 69: The Hidden Woman</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing A-Shun’s statement, Jiang Zhengkai leaned back in his chair and squinted at him. &nbsp;In his heart, Jiang Zhengkai did not trust the man. &nbsp;He had absolutely no confidence that A-Shun would truthfully tell him what had occurred in the alley. &nbsp;However, he knew that cracking the case depended on A-Shun’s assistance, and he also knew that A-Shun would cooperate with the police as long as it did not harm his personal interests. &nbsp;After all, A-Shun’s business would disintegrate if all of the women working in the alley died or ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me ask you, A-Shun; who used this room just before A-Lian’s death?” &nbsp;As he asked his question, Jiang Zhengkai took out the diagram and pointed at window three. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing Jiang Zhengkai’s question, A-Shun got up and looked attentively at the diagram before sitting back down in his chair. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, I am the one that rented that unit. &nbsp;It has always been used by the women in the alley,” said A-Shun. &nbsp;He paused for a moment. &nbsp;“The night of the incident, that unit was being used by A-Xue and A-Sha. &nbsp;I heard from A-Sha that A-Xue was the one using that unit that night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So other than A-Sha, there is no one else who could prove that A-Xue was the one using the unit?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he stared straight into A-Shun’s eyes. &nbsp;“How do you normally assign rooms in the alley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one else mentioned anything about seeing A-Xue using that unit, Inspector Jiang,” A-Shun sat there and politely replied. &nbsp;“As for room assignments, every girl is assigned a fixed room, barring extraordinary circumstances.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why is it that only A-Sha and A-Xue were working in that building that night?” persisted Jiang Zhengkai as he continued looking into A-Shun’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai’s relentless questioning finally caused A-Shun to sweat a little as beads of sweat started to appear on his forehead. &nbsp;He didn’t think Jiang Zhengkai would ask these types of questions. &nbsp;“Inspector… Inspector Jiang... “ A-Shun said embarrassingly. &nbsp;“You… you must know that business in the alley isn’t what it used to be. &nbsp;A lot of girls work in the afternoon these days so they don’t have to come at night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re working in the afternoon?” Jiang Zhengkai incredulously repeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” A-Shun nodded, “They’re only human, after all, and none of them relish the idea of dying on the job.” &nbsp;If his eyes hadn’t been shifting all over the place as he spoke, Jiang Zhengkai almost would’ve believed him. &nbsp;Unfortunately, A-Shun wasn’t enough of a stickler when it came to the details.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he leaned forward on the table. &nbsp;He lightly tapped the table before leaning back in the chair again. &nbsp;“I was in the alley that night. &nbsp;How come I remember the alley being rather lively then?” &nbsp;He glared menacingly at A-Shun as he slammed his elbows on the table. &nbsp;“A-Shun, tell me the truth! &nbsp;Were there other women in that building?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes… no!” &nbsp;In a panic, A-Shun unwittingly agreed with Jiang Zhengkai before consciously changing his answer, but it was too late. &nbsp;His brow was now full of sweat, and his expression was one of fear as he raised his head to look at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me! &nbsp;What the hell happened?” yelled Jiang Zhengkai as he slammed his fist down onto the table. &nbsp;He knew A-Shun was hiding something, but what exactly was he hiding?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well...” &nbsp;A-Shun sat there uncomfortably, sweat dripping continuously from his forehead. &nbsp;There was obviously a struggle going on inside his head. &nbsp;It appeared that what he was trying to hide was not something easy to say out loud. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai saw A-Shun was still somewhat hesitant, so he didn’t push him to answer. &nbsp;Instead, he rhythmically tapped his fingers on the table. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Tap tap tap! &nbsp;Tap tap tap! </span></i><span style>&nbsp;To A-Shun, they didn’t sound like objectd striking the table; rather, they sounded to him like objects striking his heart. &nbsp;After a few minutes, face covered in sweat, A-Shun finally raised his head and looked at Jiang Zhengkai in terror. &nbsp;He said in a shaking voice, “Inspector… Inspector Jiang, you… you have to believe me! &nbsp;I… I didn’t kill anyone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai’s countenance appeared restrained, but he was astonished at what he’d heard. &nbsp;Like A-Sha, was A-Shun also afraid that Jiang Zhengkai was trying to pin the murder on him? &nbsp;No, it couldn’t be; A-Shun’s adaptability and mental constitution were definitely not that weak. &nbsp;What he was about to confess was probably a murder that Jiang Zhengkai had known nothing about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright… alright, I’ll talk!” &nbsp;A-Shun looked at the expression on Jiang Zhengkai’s face. &nbsp;He didn’t know what lurked behind that stoic glare, but he knew he was innocent of the murder. &nbsp;Therefore, if he were to talk, then he might as well tell it all. &nbsp;He first took a deep breath, looked back at Jiang Zhengkai, and said, “That night, there were three women in that building. &nbsp;The one who used the unit you pointed out was indeed A-Xue, but there was another girl named A-Ju who was also in the building that night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, really?” &nbsp;When A-Shun paused, Jiang Zhengkai leaned back in his chair and said, “A-Ju didn’t really associate with A-Sha and A-Xue, did she?” &nbsp;In an effort to get A-Shun to confess everything he knew as quickly as possible, Jiang Zhengkai decided to take a gamble. &nbsp;Because A-Sha had not once mentioned A-Ju in her confession, Jiang Zhengkai speculated that A-Ju wasn’t particularly close with A-Sha and A-Xue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, she didn’t!” A-Shun repeatedly nodded his head in response to Jiang Zhengkai’s guess. &nbsp;“A-Ju wasn’t from the same place as them. &nbsp;Unlike most of the other girls in the alley, she also liked to use drugs… a lot. &nbsp;So that’s why a lot of the women in the alley don’t really like mentioning her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get to the point!” snapped Jiang Zhengkai when he heard A-Shun talking around the main issue. &nbsp;He rapped his knuckles against the table once more. &nbsp;“Don’t think I don’t know the truth just because you haven’t said it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector Jiang,” said A-Shun as he lowered his head in response. &nbsp;“That night, A-Ju died too, but she didn’t die like the others! &nbsp;She died from a drug overdose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s it?” &nbsp;Hearing how casually A-Shun had described A-Ju’s death, Jiang Zhengkai returned his gaze to A-Shun and asked, “It’s that simple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” &nbsp;Seeing how Jiang Zhengkai wasn’t convinced by his answer, A-Shun dropped to his knees and pleaded, “Inspector… Inspector Jiang! &nbsp;I’m telling you the truth! &nbsp;I’m not lying! &nbsp;I have a wife and kid! &nbsp;I don’t want to die, and I wouldn’t kill anyone either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are you worried about?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai saw A-Shun’s expression and knew it was one of genuine fear. &nbsp;A-Shun was clearly worried that Jiang Zhengkai suspected him of murder. &nbsp;A-Shun’s fear was a fear of death, as well as a fear of hopelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” &nbsp;A-Shun raised his trembling hand and wiped the cold sweat from his face. &nbsp;He then swallowed a mouthful of saliva before continuing, “I… I disposed of the body…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And who else?” Jiang Zhengkai asked harshly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No… no one!” A-Shun weakly replied. &nbsp;He then raised his head head and said, “Usually both A-Tie and I took care of these kinds of things, except A-Tie was out sick that night, so…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you dispose of the body?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai didn’t pursue A-Shun’s line of thinking, and instead focused on the disposition of A-Ju’s remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… buried it!” replied A-Shun. &nbsp;“I can show you where!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he finished listening to A-Shun’s confession, Jiang Zhengkai turned his head and looked at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang’s face was one of morbid astonishment. &nbsp;He didn’t know that so many women of the alley had such tragic endings, with those responsible for disposing of their remains being so hasty and casual in their actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go find Zhang Nan! &nbsp;Tell him to follow A-Shun to A-Ju’s burial site.” &nbsp;After he spoke, Jiang Zhengkai nudged Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;‘</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Lu Xiaoqiang snap out of his mortified stupor. &nbsp;“Oh! &nbsp;Yes, Inspector Jiang!” he replied before he got up and left the interrogation room. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lu Xiaoqiang left, Jiang Zhengkai glanced at A-Shun, still kneeling on the ground. &nbsp;“How many women have died in the alley over the last few years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They… the ones who didn’t use drugs are usually alright!” &nbsp;A-Shun was in somewhat of a daze as he knelt there. &nbsp;He didn’t bother getting up; it was as if he were begging for forgiveness or atoning for his sins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai saw A-Shun’s current state and knew that what lay before him was a broken man. &nbsp;Even so, A-Shun still wouldn’t give up just how many women he has buried over the years. &nbsp;After all, those weren’t his proudest moments in life, not to mention they were also highly illegal acts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything unfolded as Jiang Zhengkai had expected. &nbsp;A-Shun continued to kneel there, but he never really responded to Jiang Zhengkai’s final question. &nbsp;His only answer to Jiang Zhengkai’s “Really?” was silence. &nbsp;He knew that knowledge was something that he had to carry to the grave. &nbsp;He also knew that if he had broken the triad’s code of silence, it wouldn’t just be him, but also his wife and child that would suffer. &nbsp;Right now, his only regret was that he had revealed to Jiang Zhengkai the fact that A-Tie had helped him in disposing bodies as well.</span></p>
