 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 54: A-Jiao's Statement</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai carried A-Jiao on his back all the way to an intersection near the sub-bureau. &nbsp;&nbsp;A-Jiao would have to walk the rest of the way there, however. &nbsp;Even though it was the weekend, he didn’t want to run the risk of his colleagues seeing him carrying a pretty girl on his back and then gossiping about it behind his back later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao walked with Jiang Zhengkai into one of the sub-bureau’s conference rooms. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai pointed at one of the chairs and said, “Here, sit. &nbsp;Do you want some water or coffee? &nbsp;I’ve got coffee in my office. &nbsp;I can go brew you a cup if you’d like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, thank you,” A-Jiao shook her head in response, “I’ll just have some water. &nbsp;Also, why does this place give me the creeps?” &nbsp;As she spoke, a smile returned to her face, “Honey, why do I feel guilty everytime I’m at a police station?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!” Jiang Zhengkai laughed heartily at A-Jiao’s question, “That’s because you’ve done a lot of bad things in your life.” &nbsp;As Jiang Zhengkai walked into the conference room, he hesitated for a moment, turned around, and asked A-Jiao, “Did you want another officer present for the interview, or do you want it to be just between the two of us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh… well, it’s official business, so… I’m fine either way!” &nbsp;A-Jiao knew that according to standard police procedure, a witness interview should involve two officers. &nbsp;Even though she was never rounded up by the vice squad, basic knowledge of police tactics and procedures was common knowledge for all members of her former profession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll go get one of my colleagues?” Jiang Zhengkai asked with hesitation after hearing A-Jiao’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go ahead! &nbsp;I know what to say and what not to say,” A-Jiao pursed her lips and smiled at Jiang Zhengkai, “I won’t tell them you’re my boyfriend, so don’t worry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Jiang Zhengkai didn’t know how to respond to A-Jiao. &nbsp;He was mentally calculating how to phrase his questions so as to reduce the chances of revealing her current profession or private life. &nbsp;However, that was going to be a rather difficult endeavor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re here, Inspector Jiang!” politely greeted Lu Xiaoqiang as he bumped into Jiang Zhengkai while the latter was on his way to grab a steno pad from his office, “It’s the weekend. &nbsp;Why aren’t you spending more time with your girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;It didn’t take long for you to become quite the joker, huh?” chuckled Jiang Zhengkai after being greeted by Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>That’s right! &nbsp;I should get Lu Xiaoqiang to assist me in interviewing A-Jiao. &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang was A-Mei’s older brother, and A-Jiao was A-Mei’s protector while the latter was still alive. &nbsp;</span></i><span style>It was true that if the interview involved the three of them, many of the potentially awkward questions would become somewhat less uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoqiang, get ready to come interview a witness with me in a few minutes,” instructed Jiang Zhengkai as he stepped inside his office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok!” &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang stood behind Jiang Zhengkai and looked at him with an expression of gratitude. &nbsp;For a brand new rookie like Lu Xiaoqiang, the opportunity to interview a witness with Jiang Zhengkai was something he had very much looked forward to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Zhengkai led Lu Xiaoqiang to the conference room where A-Jiao was waiting, Lu Xiaoqiang was taken aback by who he saw, “Miss… Miss Ren, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;Why shouldn’t I be here?” asked A-Jiao while not displaying any sense of discomfort. &nbsp;The moment she decided to accompany Jiang Zhengkai to the sub-bureau, she had already prepared herself for this moment. &nbsp;For A-Jiao, this was an unusually difficult decision as she had to relive moments of her life that she would rather forget. &nbsp;Furthermore, by agreeing to give a statement, she was risking the new life that she had so painstakingly built for herself. &nbsp;However, this was the only thing she could do to help Jiang Zhengkai, to bring the criminal to justice. &nbsp;Therefore, A-Jiao ultimately chose to give up her new life so she could help the person she loved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok, that’s enough.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai had originally planned to cover for A-Jiao, but when he saw the frankness in her eyes, he had a feeling that doing so would actually be disrespecting her wishes. &nbsp;He pulled up a chair and sat next to A-Jiao before he pointed at the chair across the table and gestured for Lu Xiaoqiang to sit there. &nbsp;His choice of seating was a signal to A-Jiao that he would be right there to support her. &nbsp;This would allow A-Jiao to feel more at ease during the course of the upcoming interview as well as to remind Lu Xiaoqiang to watch his tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you like to ask, Officer Jiang and Officer Lu?” &nbsp;A-Jiao obviously saw that these seemingly simple but in fact painstakingly planned arrangements were Jiang Zhengkai’s way of protecting her. &nbsp;She smiled gratefully at Jiang Zhengkai and then looked in all seriousness at Lu Xiaoqiang, “Ask away! &nbsp;I am prepared to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok. &nbsp;So, Miss Ren… your name, please…” Lu Xiaoqiang awkwardly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t we skip this question for now?” said Jiang Zhengkai as he waved his hand, “Actually, just write down Lin A-Jiao for the name.” &nbsp;It was apparent that Jiang Zhengkai’s efforts to protect A-Jiao had already outweighed his commitment to his chosen profession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;Since I came here of my own volition, I am of course prepared to answer any and all questions,” stated A-Jiao, “So I ask Officer Jiang to not interrupt me as I am giving my statement.” &nbsp;Nevertheless, hearing what Jiang Zhengkai had just said made her smile for joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, ok… got it!” Jiang Zhengkai let out a wry chuckle. &nbsp;He didn’t know how to refute what A-Jiao had just said. &nbsp;He could only look at this woman he loved with both gratitude and concern. &nbsp;In his heart, he now hoped that once this case has been solved, he could leave this city and go live somewhere else. &nbsp;When weighing his cherished profession against this former prostitute, his profession had already become insignificant by comparison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Ren Ziyuan. &nbsp;I’m also known as A-Jiao,” A-Jiao began to explain her identity to Lu Xiaoqiang in earnest, “I am 22 years old. &nbsp;When I was 20, because of personal reasons, I withdrew from art school. &nbsp;During the following two years, I was a prostitute in one of the city’s alleys. &nbsp;My father’s name is Ren Pengfei. &nbsp;He emigrated abroad. &nbsp;My mother’s name was Lin Fangyun. &nbsp;She committed suicide two years ago. &nbsp;Because my parents were never officially married, and because I was registered under my father’s name, there is no way for you to find out information concerning Lin Yunfang’s children from official records. &nbsp;The deed to house I’m living in now is still under my mother’s name. &nbsp;I’m sure you have already tried running a background checking on me, but I’m also sure there are some holes in your check, correct?” &nbsp;At this point, A-Jiao paused and mischievously smiled at Jiang Zhengkai and Lu Xiaoqiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing A-Jiao’s statement, Jiang Zhengkai forcefully pinched his forehead as he tried his best to fake a frown. &nbsp;Nevertheless, he couldn’t help himself from smiling. &nbsp;A-Jiao really was a clever woman. &nbsp;She knew the police were investigating her, but she also knew the information they were looking for wasn’t that easy to obtain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then my sister’s card…” &nbsp;When Lu Xiaoqiang saw A-Jiao straightforwardly explaining her personal history, he very unprofessionally started asking about his late sister’s bank card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that card! &nbsp;It was always in my possession,” A-Jiao looked at Lu Xiaoqiang for a second and smiled, “Xiaomei lived a very frugal life. &nbsp;I’ve never seen a more frugal sister.” &nbsp;As she spoke those words, A-Jiao lowered her head slightly as she was still somewhat sensitive towards her former profession. &nbsp;“She sent most of the money she made back home,” A-Jiao added, “Xiaomei had a very weak personality. &nbsp;She told me she didn’t feel safe having the bank card in her possession. &nbsp;She was afraid another sister would take it from her, so she decided to give it to me for safekeeping.” &nbsp;As she spoke, A-Jiao gently placed her hand below her nose so as to prevent her tears from falling onto her cheeks. &nbsp;She felt a hint of sadness as she continued, “After she died, I continued to send monthly wires back to her family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you… thank you… Miss Ren!” said Lu Xiaoqiang as tears streamed down his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be a man! &nbsp;Stop crying!” admonished A-Jiao, but she herself turned her face sideways to hide her tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, why don’t we move on?” interrupted Jiang Zhengkai as he saw both A-Jiao and Lu Xiaoqiang were becoming quite emotional, “Let’s talk about the facts relating to the case.” &nbsp;In fact, having Lu Xiaoqiang feel like he owed A-Jiao a debt of gratitude was exactly what he had hoped for. &nbsp;Since he had already achieved his objective, it was now time to ask some substantive questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Sorry, Inspector Jiang, Miss Ren,” apologized Lu Xiaoqiang as he wiped away his tears and then shifted his focus to Jiang Zhengkai, “Inspector Jiang, I suggest we do away with the routine questions. &nbsp;I’ll let you take over with asking the substantive questions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok, that works,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded his head in agreement with Lu Xiaoqiang’s suggestion. &nbsp;There were so many things he wanted to find out from A-Jiao, but he didn’t know just where exactly to begin. &nbsp;He thought for a split second and then raised his head to look at A-Jiao, “Ziyuan, do you remember the questions I asked you while the two of us were at Hot Pot City?”</span></p>
