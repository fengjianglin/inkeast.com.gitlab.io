 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 12: The Woman Underneath the Bed</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The scene of the crime was already crammed with police officers. &nbsp;When Jiang Zhengkai arrived on scene, the forensics team was busy taking photographs and collecting forensic evidence. &nbsp;He made his way to the front of the crowd and saw the two corpses. &nbsp;“Two more lives taken,” he grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh good, you’re here, Inspector Jiang,” Zhang Nan greeted Jiang Zhengkai as he turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Any new discoveries?” Jiang Zhengkai asked while he stared at the corpses on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, sir!” Zhang Nan answered crisply. “From what we were able to gather here at the crime scene, it appears that this homicide was identical to the three that occurred before. &nbsp;There are no blood splatters, no signs of a struggle, and no indication of a forced entry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seems to me like there’s something different about this one,” Jiang Zhengkai said, all the while continuing to stare at the corpses on the bed. &nbsp;Even though Jiang Zhengkai hadn’t spoken very loudly, what he said immediately attracted the attention of every person in the room. &nbsp;All eyes turned towards Jiang Zhengkai and the bed beside him; everyone was eager to hear more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look here! &nbsp;This woman’s expression is a bit strange.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai was blind to the changed atmosphere in the room. &nbsp;His attention was too fully focused on the two corpses in front of him. &nbsp;Zhang Nan looked where Jiang Zhengkai indicated and carefully observed the woman’s corpse. &nbsp;Indeed, unlike the three previous female corpses, neither the jaw nor the eye sockets were wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And also look here, at her hands!” Jiang Zhengkai pointed at the deceased woman’s hands. &nbsp;Her boney, skin-wrapped hands weren’t like those of the previous three corpses, whose hands had hung casually to the side or had been gripping the bedsheets. &nbsp;This one’s hands were clasped in front of her chest, as if she were praying. &nbsp;Coupled with the expression on her face, it appeared that she had been begging something of someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, are you suggesting she saw the murderer?” &nbsp;After taking stock of the places Jiang Zhengkai had gestured at, Zhang Nan had reached the same astonishing conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! &nbsp;Or to be more precise, she either knew the murderer or was begging them for something.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai smirked to himself. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Who knows what the previous three women were scared to death by: the men lying on top of them, or this mysterious serial killer?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right, sir!” Zhang Nan nodded. “It looks like we finally found a slight lead that could help us crack the case.” &nbsp;As he spoke, he seemed to almost sigh in relief, as if his spirit was no longer taking a beating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s hope so!” Jiang Zhengkai continued to smile as he turned back towards Zhang Nan. &nbsp;“What was this woman’s name?”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re still looking into it,” Zhang Nan replied somewhat embarrassingly. &nbsp;“People like her are always on the move, so it’s hard to keep track of them…” he tried to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, get to it then!” Jiang Zhengkai ordered. &nbsp;He studied the man’s corpse for a while, but without saying anything more, he soon headed straight for the exit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang!” Wei Xin burst in, clearly out of breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you just come here from home?” Jiang Zhengkai asked with a smile on his face. “Hey, take it easy while you’re off duty. &nbsp;There’s no need to be so gung ho all the time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… but…” Wei Xin still couldn’t catch her breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai cut her off with a wave of his hand. “Alright, since you’re already here, why don’t you give Sergeant Zhang a hand in figuring out this woman’s identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir!” Wei Xin nodded in acknowledgment. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at Wei Xin, but an image of A-Jiao wearing her hospital gown suddenly appeared in his mind. &nbsp;He vigorously shook his head, as if he were trying to shake her image from his mind. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Why would I think of her at a time like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, is there something wrong with your neck?” asked Wei Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it’s feeling a bit stiff,” Jiang Zhengkai casually replied. “Okay, you go help Sergeant Zhang. &nbsp;I’m going to take a look upstairs.” &nbsp;He had a hunch that he had missed something, so he ran up the stairs onto the floor above.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, he still had the key to the room up there. &nbsp;He opened the door and walked in. &nbsp;The room was pitch black, but his instincts told him there wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. &nbsp;He removed the hi-beam flashlight from his utility belt and shined the light all around the room. &nbsp;The place looked like it hadn’t changed since the last time he’d been here. &nbsp;Regardless, he always carried his pistol and flashlight; it had already become a habit of his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt for the light switch next to the door and found it. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Pop! </span></i><span style>&nbsp;The lights in the room instantly turned on. &nbsp;He squatted down to carefully examine the floor. &nbsp;A light layer of dust covered it; there didn’t appear to be any new footprints. &nbsp;He then got up and tried to find the area on the floor right above where the wooden bed was in the room below. &nbsp;He eventually discovered that the bed in this room was exactly above the bed in the room below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt along the wooden bed with his hands; it felt the same as room temperature. &nbsp;Then he squatted down and lifted up the sheets so he could take a look underneath the bed. &nbsp;As he lifted the bed sheet, the figure of a long-haired woman clad in black came into view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At exactly the same time he noticed the woman, the woman also noticed him. &nbsp;Her head slowly turned towards Jiang Zhengkai as she looked into his eyes. &nbsp;She had the palest face one could imagine, completely devoid of color. &nbsp;She opened her mouth at Jiang Zhengkai, and he saw the flesh and skin around her mouth expand. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai felt a sudden sense of shock, and he fell backwards onto the floor. &nbsp;From where he was, he could see the top half of the woman’s chest exposed by the low neckline of her clothes. &nbsp;What he saw was a shrivelled chest. &nbsp;Even an elderly woman in her eighties or nineties wouldn’t have such a shrivelled-looking body. &nbsp;This was worse than that: a skeleton! &nbsp;A skin-covered skeleton!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female skeleton extended an arm towards Jiang Zhengai. &nbsp;It looked like she wanted to crawl out from under the bed. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai felt his body going numb and his heart tighten. &nbsp;He wanted to shout, but no sound came out. &nbsp;The skeleton crawled forward. &nbsp;“Uh! &nbsp;Uh! &nbsp;Uh! &nbsp;Uh!” came the sound from the skeleton’s throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai lay on the ground, unable to move, as if something was pinning him to the floor. &nbsp;Then suddenly, his cell phone started ringing. &nbsp;“Ah!” he yelled at last, as he reached for his flashlight with his left hand, turned it on, and frantically pointed it towards the skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! &nbsp;Ah!” he kept shouting as his body finally started to respond. &nbsp;He pushed himself back several feet, but when he raised his head to look beneath the bed, there was nothing there! &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Was that a figment of my imagination? &nbsp;Am I hallucinating?</span></i><span style> &nbsp;His cell phone kept on ringing, so he fished the phone out of his pocket, and answered it. “H-h-hello?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” &nbsp;It was A-Jiao’s voice on the other end. &nbsp;“You just left without saying goodbye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh… ah… I… I had a case!” Jiang Zhengkai said as he swallowed a mouthful of saliva. &nbsp;His body was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, big uncle police officer, I’m not buying it,” A-Jiao started laughing on the phone. “If you’re out chasing girls, just say so! &nbsp;That’s nothing to be ashamed of. &nbsp;Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that you forgot your bag.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! &nbsp;Okay. &nbsp;I’ll… um… I’ll just leave it with you for the time being.” Jiang Zhengkai’s tone of voice was finally returning to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My my! &nbsp;You were climaxing just now, weren’t you?” said A-Jiao in her usual irreverent way. “You sound a lot more with it than a second ago. &nbsp;Okay, I’ll stop bothering you now. &nbsp;Once I’ve recovered, I’ll repay you with some free services. &nbsp;Bye, Officer Jiang!” &nbsp;Then came a </span><i><span style>click</span></i><span style>, as she hung up the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuck me!” Jiang Zhengkai cursed softly. &nbsp;He angrily swung his fist a couple of times in the air. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>That vile bitch! </span></i><span style>&nbsp;he thought hatefully. &nbsp;However, his hatred towards A-Jiao also carried with it a sense of caring. &nbsp;As such, he didn’t truly hate her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put his cell phone back into his pocket and then remained sitting on the floor so he could calm himself. &nbsp;There really wasn’t anything underneath the bed right now, but that hallucination had felt too real! &nbsp;As he thought about what he had seen, he carefully crawled forward and reached his hand out to where the female skeleton had been only moments earlier. &nbsp;Not a damn thing there!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai let out a sigh of relief and let his hand fall to the ground. &nbsp;The floor beneath the bed was cold! &nbsp;In fact, it was freezing! &nbsp;He immediately snatched his hand back. &nbsp;Suddenly, he had an epiphany. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>I need to take a look underneath the bed in the room below…</span></i><span style> he thought. &nbsp;He didn’t even bother to close the door as he raced back down to the room below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang--” &nbsp;Wei Xin greeted him at the door, obviously wanting to tell him something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold on a sec!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai pushed her aside and bolted into the room. &nbsp;He ran over to the bed and pulled off the bed sheets. &nbsp;Nothing! &nbsp;“How could that be?” Jiang Zhengkai quietly muttered. &nbsp;He still didn’t give up and proceeded to place his hand on the floor. &nbsp;Still nothing out of the ordinary. &nbsp;“Was it really my imagination?” &nbsp;He sat down on the ground and thought to himself: </span><i><span style>People are all the same. &nbsp;When there are others around, a person’s courage knows no bounds, but when a person’s alone, he could easily scare himself to death.</span></i></p>
