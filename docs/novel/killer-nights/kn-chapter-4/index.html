 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4: New Developments</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Just like half a month ago, Jiang Zhengkai once again paid a visit to this alley. &nbsp;The difference this time, though, was that the murder occurred in a room above the one where the murder occurred last time. &nbsp;The victims were also different: a prostitute named A-Hua and a local boy named Yin Tao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the scene of the crime looked exactly like last time: no signs of a struggle and no blood splatters. &nbsp;On the bed were the skin-covered skeletons of a man and a woman in the middle of lovemaking. &nbsp;There was no evidence to indicate that anyone had entered the room between the time the victims went in and the time the police arrived on-scene. &nbsp;Everything seemed so tranquil, but behind the tranquility was a brand new murder case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All relevant suspects were once again hauled back to the station. &nbsp;As before, the initial round of interrogation revealed no credible leads. &nbsp;The only similarities between the two sets of people present were that in both cases, the victims were involved in the prostitution business, the victims died naked on a bed, and that woman A-Jiao had been nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai sat in the interrogation room. &nbsp;He felt a throbbing pain in his head. &nbsp;These two cases had no leads whatsoever. &nbsp;Two unrelated sets of victims died in two different rooms in the same building. &nbsp;What did this mean? &nbsp;He thought about it all night, but still could not figure out an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right before dawn, he patted Wei Xin awake, who had earlier fallen asleep beside him. &nbsp;“Wei, go and bring A-Jiao here. &nbsp;I want to question her again.” &nbsp;Wei Xin rubbed her sleepy eyes and then left the interrogation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>About ten minutes later, Wei Xin and another female police officer brought A-Jiao back to the interrogation room. &nbsp;Because it was early morning, the only officers at the station were those on the night shift, which did not include many female officers. &nbsp;“Hello, A-Jiao,” said Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“I want you to tell me again what happened last night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last night...” &nbsp;A-Jiao’s lips appeared a bit pale, and her hair wasn’t as neatly done as the last time he'd seen her. &nbsp;After the rough treatment Zhang Weidong and Li Chunhai had given her, she was clearly exhausted. &nbsp;“Last night, those four guys came over for a good time. &nbsp;So A-Hua went to that room, and A-Hui went to the opposite room. &nbsp;I went to Xiaomei’s room downstairs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Downstairs?” Jiang Zhengkai stared at her, shocked. “Are you saying you were in the room where the last murder occurred?” &nbsp;He could hardly believe his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” A-Jiao’s tone of voice was noticeably more measured than last time. &nbsp;She said slowly, “There was nowhere else to go. &nbsp;I had to take care of my clients. &nbsp;If I didn’t go to that room, then where else could I go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then... then did you find anything unusual about that room?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at her with a touch of strange curiosity. &nbsp;These women will do just about anything for money! &nbsp;He continued, “Had you been inside that room anytime recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” A-Jiao said as she shook her head. &nbsp;She was obviously very tired. &nbsp;If A-Hua hadn’t died last night, then it may well have been her who was lying dead on a bed today. &nbsp;The only difference is that A-Hua had turned straight into a skeleton, whereas A-Jiao would’ve died from exhaustion after too much rough sex from those two men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying there wasn’t anything unusual in that room, or that you hadn’t been inside that room recently?” Jiang Zhengkai wanted to confirm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both!” A-Jiao said as she shook her head again. &nbsp;Because of all the talking, her lips looked even paler than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give her some water,” Jiang Zhengkai said to Wei Xin. &nbsp;As an old veteran of the police force, he didn’t have too much sympathy for women like A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, sir,” A-Jiao said softly. &nbsp;Apparently, she was capable of saying nice things after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you not find anything even slightly unusual in that room?” Jiang Zhengkai asked after he saw A-Jiao take a sip of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well... Oh right, that room was very cold!” &nbsp;A-Jiao thought a bit further and softly said, “I thought it was just an illusion on my part. &nbsp;The weather isn’t that cold anymore, but that room really did feel very cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;So you’re saying the room felt very cold?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai thought this was kind of strange, so he asked one more question. “Other than that, you didn’t notice anything else unusual?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” A-Jiao nodded in response. &nbsp;“I thought it was an illusion because two people had just died there, but you can double-check with those two guys--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That'll be all.” Jiang Zhengkai said with a nod. “You can go now.” &nbsp;He didn’t care if A-Jiao was doing her business with one man, two men, or a whole group of men. &nbsp;Those things weren’t his department.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After A-Jiao left, Jiang Zhengkai looked at Wei Xin and asked, “Those two, Zheng Weidong and Li Chunhai: was there anything in their testimonies that mentioned the room was especially cold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zheng Weidong didn’t say,” Wei Xin said while shaking her head. &nbsp;“But Li Chunhai did seem to have said something similar. &nbsp;He said that the room felt especially cold to him. &nbsp;However, he said that may have been due to him being nervous because he was doing something lewd.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In that case, bring Zhang Weidong back here so we can question him again!” Jiang Zhengkai told Wei Xin. &nbsp;He furrowed his brow and rapped his head with his knuckles in frustration. &nbsp;Right now, all we know is that this room was very cold. &nbsp;It seems like a lead, but what kind of a lead is it? &nbsp;What can it explain? &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai didn’t have an answer to that question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, Officer Jiang!” &nbsp;Zhang Weidong walked in. &nbsp;By now, he had completely sobered up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me again what happened last night,” Jiang Zhengkai said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure thing!” Zhang Weidong replied. &nbsp;“Last night, the four of us were out for a get-together. &nbsp;On our way home, we--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, tell me what happened later,” interrupted Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“Last night, you, that woman A-Jiao, and Li Chunhai; which room did you all go into?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which room?” &nbsp;Zhang Weidong thought for a second. &nbsp;“I’m not exactly sure. &nbsp;I was pretty wasted then, but judging from where the screams came from, I’m pretty sure we were directly beneath where Yin Tao was.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From what you can recall, was there anything unusual about that room you were in?” Jiang Zhengkai continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unusual?” &nbsp;Zhang Weidong wondered aloud. “I don’t recall anything particularly unusual other than that the room was a bit cool. &nbsp;I do remember feeling a chill when I first entered the room, so that’s why I didn’t completely undress later on...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you’re saying the room was cold?” Jiang Zhengkai reiterated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Zhang Weidong replied, “Very, very cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you can go now.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai then said to one of Zhang Weidong’s police escorts, “Hold up. &nbsp;Bring in Li Chunhai next.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten minutes later, Li Chunhai was brought into the interrogation room. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at him and asked, “Our records indicate that you said the room you were in felt especially cold, correct?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That's right!” Li Chunhai said confidently, “That room was really cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. &nbsp;Do you remember the position of the room inside the building?” asked Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Li Chunhai said as he shook his head. “However, that room wasn’t far from the staircase. &nbsp;Anyway, judging by where the screams came from, I’m pretty certain we were below Yin Tao. &nbsp;The only problem is that the staircase was long and winding, so it’s hard to remember where exactly we were in the building. &nbsp;Oh, and one more thing: I don’t think that woman wanted to take us into that room at first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Jiang Zhengkai asked as he made eye contact with Li Chunhai. “How do you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretty simple,” Li Chunhai chuckled. “As soon as she stepped into the building, she kept on staring at that room, as if she were afraid of it or something. &nbsp;Also, the door to that room had a broken lock, so there was a temporary padlock installed. &nbsp;I noticed it when we first went upstairs, so when we came back down, I figured that was the room we were using.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Other than the room being cold, did you feel anything else? &nbsp;Or did you find anything else to be out of the ordinary?” asked Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;After hearing Li Chunhai’s statement, Jiang Zhengkai furrowed his brow and thought quietly to himself. &nbsp;He wasn’t sure if he should commend Li Chunhai on his cautiousness or if he should just consider him an architectural nut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was just cold, really cold. &nbsp;Other than that, there was nothing else unusual,” replied Li Chunhai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which room on the third floor did she originally want to take you guys?” &nbsp;After thinking to himself for a second, Jiang Zhengkai suddenly asked, “Can you identify that room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Li Chunhai replied. “There was a ‘happiness’ sticker pasted onto the door, and there was a lantern hanging next to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Li Chunhai was escorted out, Jiang Zhengkai was able to determine two facts. &nbsp;First, several people were in the old crime scene room the night the latest murder occurred. &nbsp;Second, the old crime scene room was extremely cold. &nbsp;With regard to these two facts, that woman called A-Jiao wasn’t lying. &nbsp;However, a new question entered his mind. &nbsp;When this latest murder occurred, there were people present in the room where the last murder occurred. &nbsp;Why weren’t the people in the old room turned into skeletons? &nbsp;Why did nothing happen to them at all? &nbsp;Could it be that each murder occurs on the floor above the previous one?</span></p>
