 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 79: The Case Heads in a New Direction</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It rained all night, but it finally stopped the next morning. &nbsp;Perhaps the weather gods were worried that this city’s residents might be late for work? &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai dropped A-Jiao off at the preschool and then hurried over to his own office. &nbsp;Last night’s discovery proved to be a major milestone on the road to cracking this case. &nbsp;A-Xiu, whom everyone had believed to be dead this entire time, wasn’t actually dead. &nbsp;In fact, she had just become the number one suspect in these serial murders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai sat on the chair behind his desk. &nbsp;He took out A-Jiao’s portraits and looked them over from top to bottom one more time. &nbsp;Because they had now confirmed that A-Xiu wasn’t dead, there was no reason for Jiang Zhengkai to continue staring at A-Xiu’s portrait. &nbsp;It was entire possible that this not-quite-dead woman was using some kind of advanced technology, like optoelectronics, to duplicate her likeness and then release that duplicate image at the right time to frighten others. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Mei, A-Hua, A-Li… all the way to A-Xue, Jiang Zhengkai speedily picked out their portraits from A-Jiao’s collection. &nbsp;He also added A-Xiu’s portrait to the mix, for a total of exactly seven portraits. &nbsp;Other than the fourth female victim, Yin Zhumei, he had in his possession the portraits of all the female victims. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai stood up and was about to walk to the whiteboard on the side of his office. &nbsp;He was going to sort out one more time the relationship between these eight victims. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just then, an astonishing thought suddenly flashed across his mind. &nbsp;He opened his mouth and muttered to himself, “Seven? &nbsp;How could it be seven?” &nbsp;As he spoke, he lowered his head and recounted the portraits in his hands. &nbsp;He wasn’t mistaken, there were indeed seven of them! &nbsp;Hadn’t A-Di only recently arrived in this city? &nbsp;Why would she be part of A-Jiao’s portraits? &nbsp;Or did she arrive earlier than the police had originally thought?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lingered on this thought and then looked at his watch. &nbsp;It was just past 9 o’clock, so A-Jiao should have already started teaching her class, which meant there was no way for Jiang Zhengkai to call her. &nbsp;He thought about it some more, then peered outside his office. &nbsp;Finally, he decided to summon Lu Xiaoqiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoqiang, what do you have going on this morning?” Jiang Zhengkai hastily asked as soon as Lu Xiaoqiang stepped foot into his office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing urgent,” replied Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“I’m just working on a couple of recent drunk and disorderly cases.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excellent!” nodded Jiang Zhengkai, “Hand those cases over to Liu Na. &nbsp;I need you to go meet with Zhang Nan and then bring me back as much information as he has on A-Di’s background. &nbsp;I want to know if she has ever worked in the alley before, and whether or not we missed something when looking into her background.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector Jiang!” acknowledged Lu Xiaoqiang as he sharply made an about-face and left the office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai was alone in his office once more. &nbsp;He looked at the portraits again with a sense of astonishment. &nbsp;He then wrote all eight of the victims’ names on his whiteboard. &nbsp;Finally, as if he were guided by some higher power, he wrote in between these eight names “A-Jiao.” &nbsp;Besides the fourth murder victim, all seven others had some relation to A-Jiao. &nbsp;Was it possible that A-Jiao was also familiar with the fourth murder victim Yin Zhumei, or was at least somehow acquainted with her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai furrowed his brow at he contemplated these thoughts. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Coincidence! &nbsp;It must be a coincidence! </span></i><span style>&nbsp;He tried hard to tell himself that. &nbsp;He immediately wiped away A-Jiao’s name and replaced it with the words “drug trafficking.” &nbsp;Yes, the death of these individuals may well have something to do with the drug ring! &nbsp;As for A-Jiao, she and the Bald Wolf… Jiang Zhengkai’s train of thought returned to A-Jiao, but the thought of her relationship with the Bald Wolf actually comforted him somewhat. &nbsp;Yes, A-Jiao knew these victims, but that might be because of her relationship with the Bald Wolf. &nbsp;At this point, Jiang Zhengkai forced himself to remove A-Jiao from the list of suspects. &nbsp;He firmly believed that A-Jiao could not have been involved in these murders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai stood silently in front of the whiteboard for a long time. &nbsp;He made new markings underneath each name. &nbsp;First he crossed out the first victim’s name, A-Mei, because he didn’t think A-Mei would participate in drug trafficking. &nbsp;However, the identity of the male victim who’d died with her was still a mystery to this very day. &nbsp;Therefore, Jiang Zhengkai drew a circle where this unknown male victim’s name should be. &nbsp;In other words, Jiang Zhengkai believed this man was very likely involved in the drug trade. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the second murder, Jiang Zhengkai circled A-Hua’s name, but crossed out Yin Tao’s. &nbsp;According to witness statements made immediately after the murder, it was determined that Yin Tao’s death was an accident, so he was eliminated as a possible drug dealer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the third murder, A-Li’s name was circled, while Liu Nanquan’s name was marked with a question mark. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai didn’t think it was likely that an out-of-town worker would be involved in drug trafficking. &nbsp;After all, A-Xiu’s drug ring comprised of streeting dealing by her fellow prostitutes, not using them as drug mules. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the fourth name, he naturally circled A-Xiu’s name, along with a spot where the male victim’s name should be, since the police had no way to identify him either. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the fifth murder, Jiang Zhengkai thought for a while. &nbsp;He ultimately decided to draw a question mark next to Yin Zhumei’s name while crossing out Zhu Yuping’s name. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai figured that, as a nurse, Yin Zhumei would have had access to prescription opioids as well as drug syringes. &nbsp;She may have been useful to the women in the alley. &nbsp;On the other hand, her husband Zhu Yuping had just been a simple teacher. &nbsp;Therefore, the likelihood of his involvement was low, so he was eliminated as a suspect in the drug ring. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the sixth murder, Jiang Zhengkai dwelled on A-Di’s name for some time before finally putting a circle around it. &nbsp;Clearly, he felt that A-Di’s background was suspect, and he had doubts about her cover story. &nbsp;Why would A-Jiao recognize her if she had arrived after A-Jiao had left? &nbsp;But Jiang Zhengkai drew a line through Cao Shucong’s name. &nbsp;As a salesman who frequented brothels, it was unlikely he would waste his time and resources on drugs. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the seventh murder, both A-Lian and her fake-ID-carrying john’s names were circled. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai then underlined A-Lian’s name as well, because unlike the other victims, A-Lian wasn’t dead. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai wondered if there was some way to stimulate some kind of a coherent response from this clinically-insane woman. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, for the eighth and last murder, A-Xue’s name was of course circled, because she had known A-Xiu and because she’d witnessed the seventh murder. &nbsp;As for Zhao Shuhai, his name had a question mark next to it. &nbsp;Being a taxi driver was a sensitive profession as far as the police were concerned. &nbsp;It was possible that he was helping these women transport drugs or potential buyers. &nbsp;This was something worth investigating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he had completely marked up his whiteboard, Jiang Zhengkai found that other than the first female victim, A-Mei, all the other female victims, whether deceased or insane, could be suspected of trafficking drugs. &nbsp;He thought about it some more as his attention returned to A-Mei’s name. &nbsp;He eventually decided to change the strikethrough there to a question mark. &nbsp;He felt like his initial doubts about A-Mei’s involvement in the drug ring had been made somewhat arbitrarily. &nbsp;After all, A-Mei had stayed in the alley for three years, and it was very likely that she had known A-Xiu. &nbsp;Furthermore, she’d had to shoulder her family’s considerable financial burdens, so if she’d known she could make a lot of money very quickly from dealing drugs, then it was highly unlikely that she could have resisted the temptation of easy money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this small exercise, Jiang Zhengkai took a step back and looked at all of these names. &nbsp;Practically all of the women on the board had either the opportunity or the motive to be involved in the drug trade. &nbsp;As a result, the hypothesis that this case had something to do with drug trafficking was becoming increasingly tenable. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most pressing issue right now, other than tracking down the formerly thought-to-be-deceased A-Xiu, was to confirm the identities of the three unknown male victims in this case. &nbsp;However, since this case was connected with drug trafficking, perhaps he should have the bureau contract the provincial police department or even the Ministry of Public Security to do a search in their databases for drug traffickers and their associates who had suddenly gone missing in the last few months. &nbsp;Perhaps such a search could turn up the names of their unknown male victims. &nbsp;Then again, that was easier said than done. &nbsp;China is a huge country with thousands, if not millions, of people involved in the drug trade, so finding actionable leads from such a huge trove of information was akin to find a needle in a haystack. &nbsp;Plus, how could you be sure that these three dead men would be in a police database in the first place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nevertheless, Jiang Zhengkai believed he should approach this case from a drug trafficking angle. &nbsp;Anyway, he thought it was a worth a shot. &nbsp;Perhaps approaching it from this angle might yet yield some unexpected windfalls. &nbsp;The original approach of treating this case as a serial homicide had been a dead end. &nbsp;If he couldn’t find an angle with which to make a breakthrough, then he’d never be able to crack this case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Jiang Zhengkai copied what he’d drawn on the whiteboard down onto his notepad and proceeded to wipe the whiteboard clean. &nbsp;He then took out and brought with him all the documents he had on these three unknown male victims and left for the narcotics division office.</span></p>
