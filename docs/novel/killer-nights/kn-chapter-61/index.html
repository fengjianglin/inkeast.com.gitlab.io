 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 61: Living for the Sake of Love</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Accompanied by A-Meng, A-Tao returned to his internet cafe. &nbsp;With a gloomy face, he walked back into his office. &nbsp;No one dared ask him what happened tonight. &nbsp;Of course, asking A-Meng for information might be a safer course of action, but everyone in the internet cafe knew that if A-Tao didn’t want something known, A-Meng would be just as tight-lipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take care of Brother Tao!” &nbsp;Seeing that A-Tao had walked into his room, A-Meng came downstairs and told A-Long, who was manning the the front counter, “I’m going now. &nbsp;If Brother Tao wants me, call my cell.” &nbsp;Afterwards, he left the internet cafe without a second thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Long and a couple other brothers stayed behind the front counter. &nbsp;Although they were nominally the internet cafe’s cashiers and web administrators, they were in fact all members of A-Tao’s gang. &nbsp;A-Tao had inherited what had remained of Xue Wanchuan’s crime family. &nbsp;They continued to traffick drugs and smuggle weapons, but because of A-Jiao, they didn’t deal in prostitution. &nbsp;Mondays were the only days he only allowed his subordinate brothers to frequent the alley where A-Jiao worked. &nbsp;A-Jiao was very lazy, so she had a habit of not working on Mondays. &nbsp;As for the reason, well, laziness was all there was to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Tao lay on his bed with his feet casually propped up against the footboard, in a rotten mood. &nbsp;He was about to lose his beloved baby sister. &nbsp;This was an emotional loss, not a physical loss. &nbsp;Even though A-Tao loved A-Jiao, the type of love he had for her was not one between a man and a woman, but rather a purely platonic love between a brother and a sister. &nbsp;He had never interfered in A-Jiao’s life. &nbsp;From the day he’d met her, he knew she was a prostitute. &nbsp;However, he never once asked A-Jiao to give up that unseemly profession of hers. &nbsp;He believed as long as A-Jiao was happy, then it was enough. &nbsp;He was a man who could be arrested, tried, and executed at any moment. &nbsp;The threat of death pervaded every moment of his life, so he didn’t believe he could give A-Jiao any sort of promise. &nbsp;He could only make as much money as possible and then quietly stash away the portion that belonged to him. &nbsp;He hoped that when he finally met his end, he could leave something for A-Jiao. &nbsp;Only by doing that could he possibly hope to repay the life debt he owed A-Jiao. &nbsp;But now, A-Jiao was about to leave him behind so she could live happily ever after with a cop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai!” A-Tao sighed. &nbsp;He got up and looked out the window. &nbsp;The night view outside appeared very serene, but who knew what was really happening in the midst of the dark night? &nbsp;Did he not want A-Jiao to be happy? &nbsp;Was his life more important than A-Jiao’s happiness? &nbsp;At this point in this thoughts, A-Tao let out a sad chuckle. &nbsp;In his heart, A-Jiao would always be his number one priority, even though she was of no blood relation to him whatsoever. &nbsp;All of his blood relatives had died long before he’d enlisted in the army. &nbsp;He was more or less an orphan. &nbsp;His father had died in a car accident when he was very young, and his mother had died of depression shortly thereafter. &nbsp;He’d spent his youth wandering around in his village, scraping by with just enough to stay alive. &nbsp;When he came of age, his fellow villagers thought of him as a burden, so they sent him away to the army. &nbsp;While in the military, he would meet the man who would have the most impact on his life: Xue Wanchuan. &nbsp;A-Tao’s hometown wasn’t poor or backward; in fact, it was one of the first villages to liberalize after China adopted market reforms. &nbsp;Therefore, he only had hatred, not love, for his hometown and its residents. &nbsp;In the past, he’d only loved Xue Wanchuan; now, he only loved A-Jiao, his darling baby sister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine then! &nbsp;Who am I to complain, as long as A-Jiao’s happy?” A-Tao whispered to himself as he stood next to the window. &nbsp;His mood had improved somewhat. &nbsp;If it weren’t for A-Jiao, he would’ve died at the hands of the police on that winter day more than two years ago. &nbsp;If fate should chose to have him die right now, then he’d accept his fate without hesitation. &nbsp;Of course, the prerequisite was that A-Jiao could live a happy life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one could’ve imagined that the cold-blooded killer known as “The Bald Wolf” had such a soft side. &nbsp;Even the person whom he valued the most, A-Jiao, could not have believed that he had such deep feelings for her, deep enough that he would be able to give up his life for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Tao came out of his room and walked downstairs, looking much calmer than before. &nbsp;He glanced at the front counter, but didn’t see A-Meng. &nbsp;“Where’s A-Meng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Tao! &nbsp;A-Meng went out,” A-Long respectfully replied when he looked up and saw A-Tao’s countenance had much improved from before. &nbsp;“Before he left, A-Meng said you should call him on his cell if you needed anything from him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, got it,” said A-Tao as he rubbed his bald head with his hand. &nbsp;He was more or less certain that A-Meng had gone to stand watch outside A-Jiao’s house. &nbsp;He placed great trust in A-Meng, because A-Meng was not an impulsive person, nor would he ever do anything to harm A-Jiao. &nbsp;He’d personally ordered A-Meng to protect A-Jiao, because he was worried she might get hurt. &nbsp;However, it had become increasingly apparent that his worries had been misplaced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Meng sat motionless on a rooftop across from A-Jiao’s old house. &nbsp;He was dutifully fulfilling his orders. &nbsp;A-Tao’s word was tantamount to the word of God himself. &nbsp;However, A-Meng’s calm exterior belied a soul in turmoil. &nbsp;If A-Tao gave him the order to kill A-Jiao or Jiang Zhengkai, what should he do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t believe A-Tao would kill A-Jiao. &nbsp;He understood A-Tao, and he knew A-Tao valued A-Jiao more than his own life. &nbsp;As for Jiang Zhengkai, however, A-Meng wasn’t so sure that A-Tao would be so magnanimous. &nbsp;After all, the two of them were mortal enemies, so a pre-emptive strike by A-Tao wasn’t out of the question. &nbsp;But if Jiang Zhengkai were to die, then what would happen to A-Jiao? &nbsp;Would she quickly forget that cop? &nbsp;Or would she follow him into the afterlife? &nbsp;Or would she kill A-Tao to avenge the death of her lover?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In A-Meng’s mind, he believed the last choice was the most likely answer: kill A-Tao to avenge Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;From what he knew about A-Jiao’s temper, she was capable of just about anything. &nbsp;She had her delicate side, but she also had an unusually tough side. &nbsp;She was a woman who had experienced too much pain in her life. &nbsp;She should have the chance to live a more carefree life. &nbsp;But would A-Tao give her the opportunity to do so?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the midst of thinking about all this, A-Meng threw a twig he had folded in his hands down the side of the building. &nbsp;There were entire piles of these twigs on this rooftop. &nbsp;Perhaps the residents of this building had prepared them to use as firewood in the winter. &nbsp;Without giving the twigs any more thought, A-Meng stood up and stretched out his legs. &nbsp;He saw the light in A-Jiao’s room had been extinguished. &nbsp;He knew the person he was sent to protect had gone to sleep, so he could finally find a suitable place to rest as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day’s sunrise dispersed the past night’s darkness. &nbsp;The city’s residents went about their business just like they had always done. &nbsp;Little did they know that they were this close to experiencing another bloody murder, which was only avoided at the last minute because of love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai accompanied A-Jiao to her preschool, and they then found a secluded place where they kissed each other goodbye. &nbsp;“Don’t forget to pick me up after work!” reminded A-Jiao as she left his embrace with a bright smile on her face. &nbsp;“My hubby is so handsome!” she remarked as she contentedly patted him on the shoulder, before turning around and running inside the preschool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai continued to stand in that secluded area as he gazed at A-Jiao’s receding figure until she had completely left his line of sight. &nbsp;Only then did he turn around and walk away from the preschool. &nbsp;Across from the preschool in a rented apartment, A-Meng was lying lazily on his bed. &nbsp;He had recently rented this room specifically for the purpose of spying on A-Jiao. &nbsp;From the unit’s window, his remote cameras had a 360-degree view of the entire preschool. &nbsp;Often times, spying was a form of protection. &nbsp;Moreover, being a celebrity meant you didn’t have any privacy, and A-Jiao was certainly a celebrity in A-Meng’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai walked by himself on the side of the road in the direction of the police sub-bureau. &nbsp;As soon as A-Jiao disappeared from his sight, his brain immediately shifted to his work. &nbsp;He had to consider how the new murder case was connected to the previous six cases, and then use the commonalities between them to find out the truth behind these murders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought and walked at the same time. &nbsp;Suddenly, an awkward smile flashed across his face. &nbsp;He thought about everything and decided that he still had to ask A-Jiao. &nbsp;However, every time he saw her, his brain would be filled with sweet-nothings or thoughts of doing things that a man and a woman would do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really am becoming quite the sex fiend!” Jiang Zhengkai muttered to himself. &nbsp;Thankfully, the road was noisy, and the sound of passing vehicles masked his quiet utterance. &nbsp;Had he said that in the office, it definitely would’ve attracted undue attention from his colleagues. &nbsp;Police officers could gossip with the best of them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he lost himself in his fancies, Jiang Zhengkai unconsciously walked into the sub-bureau. &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang saw Jiang Zhengkai’s silhouette, glanced at his office, and then came rushing forward. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, Commissioner Yao is waiting in your office!” he quietly whispered to Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he shot a surprised side-glance at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“What’s going on?” &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang could only vigorously shake his head to show that he did not know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wheels inside Jiang Zhengkai’s brain were spinning furiously. &nbsp;He didn’t know why exactly Yao Tianyu had come to his office so early in the morning, but he did know that it must be related to something extremely important. &nbsp;He collected his thoughts and then rapidly walked towards his office.</span></p>
