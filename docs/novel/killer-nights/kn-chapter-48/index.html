 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 48: The Woman Beside Him</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai had no clue what was happening on TV. &nbsp;All his senses were concentrated on the woman in front of him. &nbsp;This young, beautiful, mirror image of A-Jiao lay beside his chest and quickly fell asleep. &nbsp;He listened to her rhythmic breathing and knew she was sleeping soundly. &nbsp;What he didn’t know was that she had waited a long, long time for this moment. &nbsp;But hadn’t he also yearned for this day to come? &nbsp;The only problem was, he still wasn’t completely certain the woman sleeping in his arms was his beloved A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That night, Jiang Zhengkai couldn’t sleep. &nbsp;The exhilarating scent of the woman beside him kept him up all night. &nbsp;He quietly turned on the nightstand lamp and spent the entire night gazing attentively at her, like he was appreciating a piece of fine art. &nbsp;It was a familiar face, and he had already kissed her once. &nbsp;Right now, he wanted to kiss that face again, but he was afraid of where it might lead… ai! &nbsp;Forget it. &nbsp;As these thoughts coursed through his mind, Jiang Zhengkai relaxed his embrace around her. &nbsp;At thirty-five years old, he’d rather leave those fantasies unrealized than to court drama by making them come true. &nbsp;But then again, he was in A-Jiao’s bed, or more accurately, Ren Ziyuan’s bed. &nbsp;Wasn’t that drama enough?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, A-Jiao had no such doubts. &nbsp;She loved Jiang Zhengkai, so of course she yearned to sleep in his arms. &nbsp;She knew he would protect her and provide her a safe haven. &nbsp;She was tired, truly tired, and she needed to rest on a set of broad shoulders. &nbsp;On this night, she didn’t care whether she was A-Jiao or Ren Ziyuan. &nbsp;She only knew that she wanted to be in this man’s embrace. &nbsp;So she slept very soundly and very peacefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the sky gradually grew brighter, Jiang Zhengkai dozed off for a bit while still propped up against the headboard. &nbsp;Before long, A-Jiao woke from her slumber. &nbsp;She stretched out her body while still lying on his arm before climbing on top of Jiang Zhengkai to stare at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake?” Jiang Zhengkai said as he came out of his catnap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup!” A-Jiao mischievously said to Jiang Zhengkai, propping up her face with both hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;“Looks like Brother Jiang behaved himself quite well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?” asked Jiang Zhengkai, quite confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you I was on my period, and you believed me?” A-Jiao said amidst giggles, “I was lying to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, damn girl! &nbsp;You’ll never find a husband at this rate!” Jiang Zhengkai indignantly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t find a husband?” repeated A-Jiao. &nbsp;She got up and knelt beside him. &nbsp;“Oh! &nbsp;So you’ve slept with me, but now you don’t want to marry me?” &nbsp;She bent her neck and looked at him with pursed lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai could come up with nothing in response. &nbsp;It’s true, he had slept with her, but besides sleeping, he hadn’t done anything else! &nbsp;However, that was not something a man could easily say, especially a man with a strong sense of personal responsibility like Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright! &nbsp;I was just messing with you!” A-Jiao relented while she reached over and squeezed Jiang Zhengkai’s nose. &nbsp;“Keep thinking about that A-Jiao of yours then!” &nbsp;&nbsp;She pushed her body up against his again. &nbsp;“Brother Jiang, do you really like A-Jiao that much? &nbsp;If… if one day you found out she had lied to you, would… would you be angry with her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never!” Jiang Zhengkai shook his head. &nbsp;That expression in his eyes was one of emptiness and helplessness. &nbsp;When a man’s eyes looked that way, it meant he wasn’t lying. &nbsp;Having been a prostitute for two years, A-Jiao was quite adept at reading men’s eyes. &nbsp;Perhaps in Jiang Zhengkai’s heart, A-Jiao truly was the most important thing in the world?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then! &nbsp;What do you want for breakfast? &nbsp;I’ll make whatever you like.” &nbsp;A-Jiao got up off his body and onto the floor. &nbsp;She acted like what Jiang Zhengkai had just said had no bearing on her life whatsoever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine with anything,” Jiang Zhengkai casually responded. &nbsp;Even though he hadn’t slept the entire night, he nevertheless felt quite energetic. &nbsp;On the one hand, it was because of his professional training to operate even while sleep deprived; on the other hand, it was also because he simply could not take his eyes off this young woman beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anything? &nbsp;Let me see if I can find a dish called ‘anything’ in the fridge,” said A-Jiao as she ran her fingers through her hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai looked at A-Jiao’s backside. &nbsp;He couldn’t help but wonder if she used to have long hair. &nbsp;Otherwise, why would she have a habit of running her fingers through her hair? &nbsp;As short as it was, she had no need to do so. &nbsp;“Ziyuan, have you always had short hair?” he asked with feigned casualness as he went about making the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm… yeah!” A-Jiao went momentarily blank before she replied back from the kitchen. &nbsp;Of course, she had no idea that her unconscious actions had already revealed the fact that she used to have long hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Jiang Zhengkai acknowledged from the bedroom, “I think you’d look really pretty with long hair!” &nbsp;He already knew A-Jiao was lying, but he still wanted to go a step further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” asked A-Jiao as she bustled around in the kitchen. &nbsp;“Having long hair is such a hassle, but if you like it, I can grow it out for you!” &nbsp;She peeked her head out from the kitchen. &nbsp;“Tell me the truth, A-Jiao used to have long hair, didn’t she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;Why does everything have to relate back to her?” asked Jiang Zhengkai with a big grin on his face. &nbsp;In his heart, however, he thought, </span><i><span style>That damned girl; keep acting, why don’t you? &nbsp;One of these days, I will expose your secret!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;Right now, he was increasingly certain that the woman before him was indeed A-Jiao, but he still needed to find the smoking gun that would prove his suspicions once and for all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After breakfast, Jiang Zhengkai first sent A-Jiao to her preschool before walking alone to the sub-bureau. &nbsp;On the way there, his mind was filled with thoughts of Ren Ziyuan, the A-Jiao doppelganger. &nbsp;He was finding that Ren Ziyuan and A-Jiao had more and more in common. &nbsp;Based on his intuition, he was almost certain the two were one and the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was one thing that confused him, for which he had no explanation, and that was the difference in eye color between A-Jiao and Ren Ziyuan. &nbsp;The colors of their irises were completely different. &nbsp;Perhaps he was mistaken about A-Jiao’s eye color? &nbsp;On this question, Jiang Zhengkai simply could not dispel the doubts he had in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Jiang Zhengkai walked into his office, Lu Xiaoqiang knocked on the door and came in. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, here’s the photo you wanted. &nbsp;Is the resolution high enough for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad!” commended Jiang Zhengkai as he studied the photograph. &nbsp;He looked up at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“Xiaoqiang, go take the rest of the day off.” &nbsp;Clearly, he was concerned that losing his sister might adversely affect Lu Xiaoqiang’s physical and emotional health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m alright,” Lu Xiaoqiang firmly shook his head. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, I hope I can help you work this case. &nbsp;I want to personally apprehend the scumbag who killed my sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai… alright,” sighed Jiang Zhengkai as he sat down at this desk. &nbsp;“Is the file on your computer hi-res? &nbsp;I want to know this A-Jiao’s eye color.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it is. &nbsp;Her eyes are black. &nbsp;I clearly saw them!” Lu Xiaoqiang straightforwardly replied. &nbsp;He quietly added, “Inspector Jiang, I hope you’re not mad at what I’m about to say, but I think your girlfriend looks a lot like that A-Jiao…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that right?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at him with approval. &nbsp;This young man was quite remarkable; he had a very keen sense of observation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;Sorry if I’m being nosy,” Lu Xiaoqiang said as he scratched his head. &nbsp;“But just based on the photograph, I’d say that they are practically the same person…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve thought the same exact thing!” Jiang Zhengkai exclaimed as he leaned back in his chair. &nbsp;He let out a deep breath through his nose and said, “Go get me me the digital file! &nbsp;The color of their eyes seems to be somewhat different.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got it, Inspector!” &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang made an abrupt about-face and left the office. &nbsp;He quickly returned with a USB drive in his hand with the picture of A-Mei and A-Jiao on it. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai plugged the USB drive into his computer, blew up the image, and carefully looked at A-Jiao’s eyes. &nbsp;Her irises were indeed black!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Other than having different color eyes, they look practically identical,” Jiang Zhengkai quietly muttered as he leaned back in his chair again. &nbsp;He sat pensively in his chair for a while before raising his head and looking at Lu Xiaoqiang again. &nbsp;“You said there’s been someone wiring your family money every month for the last several months?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector. &nbsp;The person used my sister’s bank account to wire the money,” Lu Xiaoqiang answered with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! &nbsp;Follow this lead for the next couple of days!” Jiang Zhengkai said as he stared at the picture on his monitor. &nbsp;“Find out when and where this account was used to wire money to your family. &nbsp;The bank should be able to give you all of that information. &nbsp;If you are able to find CCTV footage, I want that as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector Jiang! &nbsp;I’ll take care of it right away!” acknowledged Lu Xiaoqiang, before he turned around and left Jiang Zhengkai’s office.</span></p>
