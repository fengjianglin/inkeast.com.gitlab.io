 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 7: A Woman&nbsp;Violated</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai sat in his office for an entire afternoon. &nbsp;This case had completely ruined his mood. &nbsp;There wasn't a single clue in sight, nor were there any credible leads to speak of. &nbsp;All he had as evidence were six human bodies thoroughly devoid of flesh and blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Xin knocked on Jiang Zhengkai’s office door. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, are you planning on working overtime tonight?” she asked quietly as she came in and placed the investigation report regarding the third set of murders on his desk. &nbsp;The investigators had been able to verify the victims' identities. &nbsp;The female victim was a prostitute called A-Li, while the male victim was a migrant worker by the name of Liu Nanquan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai shook his head and said, “No, I’m going home. &nbsp;In fact, tell everyone to take the next two days off!” &nbsp;He waved his hand at Wei Xin and remarked, “They haven’t had a break in ages, so I’m giving them a couple of days off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, but... Inspector Jiang, didn’t our superiors say...?” Wei Xin’s voice trailed off as she didn’t want to further upset Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;What she wanted to say was: Didn’t our superiors set a deadline to crack this case? &nbsp;If we’re taking a break now, doesn’t that mean there’s even less of a chance of solving it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, reports about what we've been up to are plastered all over the news. &nbsp;Do you seriously think those women will risk coming out tonight?” Jiang Zhengkai replied as he looked at Wei Xin with a wry smile on his face. “Anyway, that’s all for today. &nbsp;Go home and enjoy the weekend! &nbsp;We’ll meet back on Monday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the night breeze blowing, Jiang Zhengkai slowly walked out onto the street alone. &nbsp;This case was giving him a serious headache. &nbsp;Soon, without even realizing it, he had walked back to the alley where A-Jiao and her girls worked. &nbsp;Ah well, since I’m here already, might as well go inside and take a look. &nbsp;Following that line of thinking, he proceeded to walk down the alley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Tao, I’m gonna get going now,” A-Jiao called out to the owner of the internet cafe as she exited the building. &nbsp;By this point, her stomach was growling, since it was well past dinner time, and she hadn't eaten anything yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the dark of the night, A-Jiao swung her purse back and forth to stave off boredom as she walked back home. &nbsp;Along the way, she stopped at a noodle shop and ordered a bowl of hand-sliced noodles. &nbsp;A-Jiao would never have come to a place like this before, but ever since Xiaomei had died, something had changed inside of her, and she had stopped frequenting mid- and high-end restaurants altogether.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What will you be having today, Miss A-Jiao? &nbsp;A bowl of noodles again?” the owner of the restaurant kindly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, Uncle Cai!” A-Jiao replied with a smile on her face. &nbsp;If not for the fact that she stood in that dark alley at night, nobody would have guessed she worked in such an ill-regarded profession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you just sit tight there. &nbsp;I’ll be right back with your noodles,” said Uncle Cai as he wiped clean A-Jiao’s table. &nbsp;He then leaned over and said in a concerned tone, “A-Jiao, it hasn’t been very safe here lately. &nbsp;You have to be careful if you go out alone at night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks, Uncle Cai. &nbsp;I’ll be alright.” &nbsp;As A-Jiao spoke, she smiled enough to reveal a pair of dimples. Together with her outfit today, she looked like just another mischievous young girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, you can’t be too careful,” remarked Uncle Cai. &nbsp;He then turned around and headed into the kitchen to make A-Jiao’s noodles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A city at nighttime naturally has its own special kind of charm. &nbsp;Even though A-Jiao had always worked during nighttime, she very rarely had the time to quietly appreciate all the beauty a city could offer at night. &nbsp;Of course, there is nothing beautiful about a dimly-lit alley, which is where A-Jiao was during most nights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here are your noodles, A-Jiao,” Uncle Cai said as he carried a bowl of noodles out from the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great, thank you! &nbsp;Here’s money for the noodles.” &nbsp;A-Jiao took a five yuan note out of her purse and placed it in Uncle Cai’s hand. &nbsp;“Uncle Cai, your noodles are so delicious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you! &nbsp;Go ahead and eat up,” said Uncle Cai as he placed the money into his pocket. &nbsp;He then looked at A-Jiao and said, “Don’t let your noodles get cold. &nbsp;They don’t taste as good when they’re cold. &nbsp;If you need more toppings, just holler at me, and I’ll go get you some more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay. &nbsp;Thanks again, Uncle Cai!” A-Jiao nodded her head as she mumbled her words through a mouth full of noodles. &nbsp;Even though A-Jiao hadn’t been a customer of Uncle Cai’s for very long, the old man nevertheless liked this clever-looking girl quite a lot. Every time she came, he would give her an extra bowl of toppings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After about ten minutes, A-Jiao stood up and yelled towards the kitchen, “Uncle Cai, I’m done eating here! &nbsp;I’m gonna go now! &nbsp;Take care!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, child,” Uncle Cai’s voice drifted in from the kitchen. “Take care of yourself out there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it!” A-Jiao replied. &nbsp;She left the noodle shop and continued walking towards her home. &nbsp;When she got to the intersection, however, she glanced over in the direction of the alley. &nbsp;She felt as if some unseen force was pulling her towards that alley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbeknownst to A-Jiao, a man had been quietly following her the entire time. &nbsp;It was none other than the man she scolded back at the internet cafe earlier in the day. &nbsp;Being humiliated by a female stranger and then mocked by a group of local thugs would be more than most men could bear. &nbsp;Plus, he wasn't exactly a gentleman anyway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao walked inside the alley and felt that it seemed especially deserted today. &nbsp;Despite a thorough scan of the area, there wasn't a single soul in sight. &nbsp;Obviously, the media had done their work in scaring people away. &nbsp;Right now, it didn’t matter if you were a buyer or a seller, everyone stayed as far away from this alley as they could, afraid of attracting whatever evil presence lurked within its shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap tap, rapped the sound of A-Jiao’s stiletto heels as they struck the cobblestone road beneath her. &nbsp;On this quiet evening, the tapping of her shoes carried especially very far and sounded especially crisp. &nbsp;Far behind her, however, was a silent shadow stalking her every move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When A-Jiao arrived at the building where she worked, she stopped and took a look inside. &nbsp;There wasn’t a single light visible in the building. &nbsp;The whole edifice looked like a giant monster with its mouth wide open, ready to devour any prey who dared to enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai,” A-Jiao let out a sigh. &nbsp;She was just about to walk away when she suddenly felt a large hand covering her mouth and another hand grabbing a brick-like object which swung towards her head at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style><em>BAM!</em> &nbsp;The brick struck the back of A-Jiao’s head. &nbsp;Her knees grew weak, and her eyes went dark as she collapsed onto the floor. &nbsp;Behind her, the man with the big hands looked at the pitch-black darkness within the building and carried her inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s your attitude now, princess?” &nbsp;The man pulled A-Jiao’s purse off her shoulder and opened it to see what was inside. &nbsp;He found over a hundred yuan in cash, a cell phone, and a credit card, all of which he placed into his pocket. &nbsp;He continued rummaging through her possessions, but all he saw were lip gloss, mascara, rouge, and other forms of makeup. &nbsp;Lastly, he found a pair of black silk stockings and a string of condoms, the tools of A-Jiao’s trade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, what do we have here? &nbsp;Looks like you want me to love you long time,” said the man as he rubbed A-Jiao’s face with his hands, which then quickly moved to her chest. &nbsp;Just then, the men heard the echo of footsteps, which seemed to be getting closer. &nbsp;Accompanying the footsteps was the buzz of conversation. &nbsp;The man immediately stopped what he was doing and held his breath, quietly listening to the footsteps in the alley. &nbsp;After a few minutes, the footsteps and voices gradually became softer and eventually faded away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just a couple of passers-by!” the man said softly. &nbsp;However, this incident did alert him to something. &nbsp;If A-Jiao suddenly woke up in the middle of the act, then he would have a serious problem on his hands. &nbsp;After thinking it over for a few seconds, he stripped A-Jiao of her clothes and tied her up into a shape somewhat reminiscent of a frog. &nbsp;He then carefully listened for any further commotion nearby, but all was quiet in the alley tonight. &nbsp;There won’t be anyone stopping me from having a good time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this dark hallway, all that the pale moonlight was able to illuminate was a silhouette of a man's body moving up and down. &nbsp;There also appeared to be something underneath him that was also moving with him. &nbsp;And at the same time, a series of whining noises could be heard from where this silhouette stood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the source of the moans was not the male silhouette, but rather what was beneath him. &nbsp;From the sound of it, it seemed like the desperate cries of a woman, but it didn’t sound quite like it either. &nbsp;Actually, it sounded more like faint whispers coming from the back of the human throat or the sad cries of some sort of wounded animal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also the staccato of a man’s grunts as the male silhouette increased the speed of his movements. &nbsp;After a while, the grunts reached a climax before falling silent and the silhouette gradually became still as well. &nbsp;After several minutes of inactivity, the silhouette appeared to have flipped the object underneath him and then made a series of whipping sounds. &nbsp;Then the grunts began again as the silhouette resumed his thrusting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These types of acts are a common occurrence in this alley. &nbsp;After all, most of the men who come to this alley are looking to do exactly these types of acts with women. &nbsp;The only difference is most times these acts happen inside the building’s bedrooms, but today, it happened in the building’s hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stars of this “silhouette show” were none other than A-Jiao and the man stalking her. &nbsp;Some people do these acts out of love, some do it for money, while others do it to satisfy their desire for revenge...</span></p>
