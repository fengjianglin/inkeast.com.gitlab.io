 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 39: A Game of Cat and Mouse</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As the dusk sun began to set, Jiang Zhengkai finally woke up from his dreamy slumber. &nbsp;He let out a yawn while still lying down in his reclined driver’s seat. &nbsp;He then shifted his gaze to A-Jiao’s window, where nothing had changed. &nbsp;Bored, he took out his cell phone, only to see that it was almost 6PM. &nbsp;He also noticed the text message icon flashing non-stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, must more junk texts…” Jiang Zhengkai said as he opened his inbox. &nbsp;He was about to bulk delete all of his stored text messages when one line of text caught his eye, “Uncle Policeman, you look so stupid when you’re asleep!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao!” Jiang Zhengkai exclaimed as he abruptly sat up in the driver’s seat. &nbsp;The drowsiness that had clouded his mind just a moment ago had completely dissipated. &nbsp;He called the number used to send the text message, but it went straight to voicemail. &nbsp;He then looked at A-Jiao’s window, but there still weren’t any signs of movement. &nbsp;Nevertheless, he decided to start his car and drove over to A-Jiao’s condo building. &nbsp;He then darted out of the car and went straight for the Unit 302 doorbell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, Uncle Policeman! &nbsp;If you love me, please press 1; if you don’t love me, please press 2,” A-Jiao’s pre-recorded message came over the digital doorbell’s intercom system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn that girl!” Jiang Zhengkai cursed under his breath. &nbsp;He moved his finger over the “1” button, but did not press it. &nbsp;Instead, he changed his mind and decided to press “2.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to hell!” A-Jiao’s voice said over the intercom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!” Jiang Zhengkai heartilylaughed at the response, but he was quickly disappointed by the </span><i><span style>beep</span></i><span style>,</span> <span style>signaling that the voicemail function had kicked in. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Whatever, I’ll humor this little girl’s vanity this one time,</span></i><span style> he thought to himself. &nbsp;He exited out of the system and rang the digital doorbell again. &nbsp;This time, he unhesitatingly pressed “1.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to hell!” said A-Jiao’s pre-recorded voice. &nbsp;Afterwards came the </span><i><span style>beep </span></i><span style>to voicemail again. &nbsp;Love or love not, apparently there was no right answer between the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddamn it girl, get out here right now!” Jiang Zhengkai yelled at the doorbell, “I know you’re in there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Jiang Zhengkai guessed wrong. &nbsp;He slept for way too long, so A-Jiao had already left her condo for a while now. &nbsp;However, she didn’t go very far. &nbsp;If Jiang Zhengkai weren’t so focused on the doorbell, if only he had paused for a few moments to look around, he would have found a young woman secretly observing him from a not-so-distant place. &nbsp;Even though she was somewhat hidden from view, it wouldn’t have been hard to find her if he had wanted to track her down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai!” Jiang Zhengkai sighed. &nbsp;He shook the metal security door in frustration before turning around and desolately walking towards his police cruiser. &nbsp;Behind him, A-Jiao really wanted to jump out of her hiding spot, shout out his name, then run into his waiting embrace, but she refrained from doing so. &nbsp;She liked playing this game of cat and mouse, but it was also a sense of insecurity that stopped her from chasing down Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;At the end, she quietly watched as this man she loved, this man who loved her, sadly walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai drove his car over to Uncle Cai’s noodle shop. &nbsp;“Uncle Cai, a large noodle of hand-cut noodles with extra paste, plus an order of </span><i><span style>thentuk</span></i><span style>!” Jiang Zhengkai yelled at the kitchen as he was finding a table to sit down at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coming!” an elderly female voice came from the kitchen, “I’ll be right there!” &nbsp;After a short while, the old lady brought out Jiang Zhengkai’s entire order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie, where is Uncle Cai?” Jiang Zhengkai asked the old lady in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him? &nbsp;His kid’s getting married, so he went back to his hometown. &nbsp;I’m looking over this place while he’s gone,” the old lady replied with an honest smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie Ma, a bowl of hand-cut noodles and half an order of </span><i><span style>thentuk</span></i><span style>, please!” a young woman’s voice came from behind Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;The voice was as cheerful and crisp as he had remembered it. &nbsp;Was this the voice that he had longed for all this time? &nbsp;Hearing that voice again, Jiang Zhengkai excitedly turned around, only to see A-Jiao’s alter ego Ren Ziyuan standing in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hi, Officer Jiang, you’re here, too?” A-Jiao calmly asked when she discovered Jiang Zhengkai was right beside her. &nbsp;Did she really not know Jiang Zhengkai was inside? &nbsp;After all, his police cruiser was parked right outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh hi, Miss Ren! &nbsp;You like noodles, too?” Jiang Zhengkai asked. &nbsp;Right now, his head was throbbing, and he felt a bit light-headed. &nbsp;Perhaps he really should get some rest. &nbsp;Could it be he was seeing A-Jiao in every young woman that he encountered?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie Ma, remember not to add any paste. &nbsp;My throat’s been feeling sore lately,” A-Jiao purposely reminded the old lady, “Uncle Cai’s not back yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’ll be back soon!” the old lady replied, “But you’ve got to drink more water.” &nbsp;She then walked into the kitchen to prepare A-Jiao’s noodles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May I join you?” A-Jiao cocked her head and asked a stupefied Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, yeah, please!” Jiang Zhengkai responded as he snapped out of his daydream, “Please sit… please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what’s your full name, Officer Jiang?” A-Jiao asked as she sat down across from him, her face full of what appeared to be admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Zhengkai,” Jiang Zhengkai answered with a bit of uneasiness. &nbsp;He still felt for some reason that the woman across from him was in fact A-Jiao, but his rational mind forced him to accept </span> <span style>the fact that this woman was actually Ren Ziyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Zhengkai?” A-Jiao slightly bowed her head and pursed her lips as if she was trying very hard to memorize his name. &nbsp;“So was Wei Xin a colleague of yours? &nbsp;Oh, and what should I call you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, we were colleagues,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded, “As for what you should call me, why don’t you call me Brother Jiang? &nbsp;I’m pretty sure I’m quite a few years older than you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then!” A-Jiao nodded. &nbsp;She thought to herself, </span><i><span style>you idiot, why don’t you tell me to call you Uncle Jiang</span></i><span style>? &nbsp;At the thought of that, she wanted to laugh, but she ultimately controlled herself. &nbsp;“Why aren’t you eating, Brother Jiang?” A-Jiao asked in a most gentle tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh… yeah… right.” &nbsp;Upon hearing what A-Jiao had said, he immediately scraped all of the paste into his noodle bowl. &nbsp;He then picked up the bowl and started wolfing down the noodles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Brother Jiang, isn’t all of that paste going to make your noodles too salty?” A-Jiao couldn’t help but laugh at Jiang Zhengkai’s embarrassed look. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>You are really cute in a stupid kind of way.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, not salty!” Jiang Zhengkai replied. &nbsp;He couldn’t explain it, but every time he looked at the woman sitting on the other side of the table, he felt a sense of discomfort within him. &nbsp;Shouldn’t he be pleased to be sitting across such a pretty woman instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Auntie Ma!” A-Jiao said as she received her order of noodles and </span><i><span style>thentuk</span></i><span style>. &nbsp;She looked at the speed eater in front of her and felt a slight pang of sorrow, “Brother Jiang, I know you’re hungry, but you really should slow down a bit. &nbsp;How about I give you some of my noodles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… ahem… ahem.” &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Ai, that idiot finally choked on the noodles he was trying inhale.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai ate their dinner amidst tension and relaxation, comfort and awkwardness. &nbsp;After they finished, Jiang Zhengkai insisted on picking up A-Jiao’s tab. &nbsp;They then left Uncle Cai’s noodle shop together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Jiang, I need to get back home now. &nbsp;Are you working late tonight?” A-Jiao asked the person beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I won’t,” Jiang Zhengkai replied, “You take care now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm, I live kind of far away from here,” A-Jiao said as she placed her hands behind her back and struck a bashful pose. &nbsp;In her mind, however, she was throwing a string of curses at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>You idiot! &nbsp;Imbecile! &nbsp;You’ll never get laid at this rate! &nbsp;Would it kill you to take me home?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm… I…” Jiang Zhengkai mumbled as he rubbed his upper lip with his finger. &nbsp;He then nervously looked left and right before swallowing a mouthful of saliva.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could you take me home then?” A-Jiao asked as she bat her eyelashes and stared at Jiang Zhengkai with her charming eyes. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>You stupid son of a bitch! &nbsp;Did I really have to ask you that myself?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, sure!” Jiang Zhengkai finally agreed after A-Jiao’s direct prompt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So you were waiting for me to ask the whole time, is that it? &nbsp;Just wait and see the payback I’ve got in store for you!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;A-Jiao thought in her mind, but her mouth said something quite different, “Let’s get going then, Brother Jiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, my car’s that way,” Jiang Zhengkai pointed at his police cruiser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A cop car?” A-Jiao glanced at the car and then started giggling, “How about I sit in front, and you sit in the back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… hehe! &nbsp;You know how to drive?” Jiang Zhengkai started to laugh as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope!” A-Jiao answered as she walked over to the police cruiser and looked at it with great fascination, “I’ve never been inside a police car before! &nbsp;I only know from all the cop shows I’ve watched that it’s the bad guys who sit in the back.” &nbsp;She then turned around and made a shy smile at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In that case, I’ll be the one sitting in the front, but I can let you play a bad guy for this ride,” said Jiang Zhengkai as he pointed at the car’s backseat. &nbsp;By now he was certain the woman beside him wasn’t A-Jiao, only a preschool teacher named Ren Ziyuan. &nbsp;Therefore, his mood became somewhat more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way! &nbsp;I’m not a bad guy! &nbsp;Can I sit beside you in the front instead?” A-Jiao raised her face and expectantly asked Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, get in!” Jiang Zhengkai said as he walked over to the driver’s seat. &nbsp;A-Jiao stood where she was and let out a giggle. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>If only this stupid man could carry me to the front passenger seat instead!</span></i></p>
