 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 49: Ziyuan's Date</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>At lunchtime, Cui Jing and A-Jiao walked past one another in the preschool’s hallway. &nbsp;A-Jiao could tell from Cui Jing’s expression that she was quite upset. &nbsp;However, she did not know that the reason for Cui Jing’s unhappiness was A-Jiao herself, the root cause of Li Hongbin’s savage beating. &nbsp;Based on what A-Jiao knew about playboys like Li Hongbin, he definitely wouldn’t have told Cui Jing the truth. &nbsp;However, she couldn’t really ask Cui Jing directly what was going on with her boyfriend, so the only thing she could do was play dumb in front of Cui Jing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao, someone beat up my boyfriend!” Cui Jing proactively sought A-Jiao out after she saw A-Jiao in the hallway. &nbsp;At the preschool, A-Jiao was known for a kind demeanor, so many of the preschool’s young teachers like to confide in her. &nbsp;Women all craved communication. &nbsp;Unlike men, women were practically unable to keep their secrets bottled up inside. &nbsp;For that reason, spy movies almost always depicted a woman as the person carelessly giving up top secret intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;Is he hurt bad?” A-Jiao asked with feigned concern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh-huh,” Cui Jing replied, “He has several broken ribs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way, really?” A-Jiao asked in surprise after taking a bite of her food. &nbsp;Her mind quickly recounted what happened that night, but she didn’t seem to remember A-Meng kicking Li Hongbin in the ribs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, really! &nbsp;Li Hongbin said he saw someone being mugged two nights ago, and so he...” Cui Jing then told A-Jiao the long story that Li Hongbin himself had invented about his “heroic deeds” that night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, your boyfriend is a real badass!” A-Jiao commented on Cui Jing’s story while she ate. &nbsp;She had no inclination of bursting Cui Jing’s bubble. &nbsp;As long as that playboy stayed the hell away from her, A-Jiao could care less how many girls he tried to seduce. &nbsp;Some girls like to be tricked, but hey, that’s on them. &nbsp;That was A-Jiao’s logic anyway. &nbsp;While it seemed quite fair in her mind, it was actually the polar opposite of what most women thought of such a man. &nbsp;Perhaps her views were influenced by her own personal experiences. &nbsp;To put it bluntly, she didn’t feel any sympathy towards Cui Jing because Cui Jing reminded A-Jiao a great deal of herself when she was younger. &nbsp;In essence, you could describe the A-Jiao of the past and the Cui Jing of today with just one word, and that word was “stupid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But he’s seriously injured! &nbsp;What are we going to do?” Cui Jing said worriedly as she looked desolately at A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I guess he should seek medical attention right away,” A-Jiao smiled at Cui Jing and said, “Don’t worry! &nbsp;How about this: I’ll take your afternoon classes so you can go and take care of him!” &nbsp;Even though A-Jiao found Li Hongbin to be entirely disgusting, she nevertheless felt guilty for being the reason why he was in the hospital right now. &nbsp;Therefore, helping Cui Jing was one thing she could do to allay her guilt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I feel bad,” Cui Jing bashfully replied, “I’m always creating more work for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about me! &nbsp;Just go!” A-Jiao happily told Cui Jing, “But you need to keep an eye on him just in case he decides to play a good samaritan again.” &nbsp;What she really wanted to say was, </span><i><span style>yeah, keep an eye on him because he’s a real playboy!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;But then she looked at Cui Jing and realized the girl could only play the role of a doormat when it came to relationships.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After lunch, A-Jiao called Jiang Zhengkai’s phone, “Brother Jiang, are you free tonight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I should be. &nbsp;Why, what’s up?” Jiang Zhengkai replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excellent!” exclaimed A-Jiao. &nbsp;After hearing Jiang Zhengkai was free, she suddenly felt her face becoming inexplicably red, “Then you should come pick me up and take me somewhere fun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, alrighty!” Jiang Zhengkai quickly accepted A-Jiao’s invitation to a date. &nbsp;Right now, Jiang Zhengkai was all too eager to go out on a date with A-Jiao. &nbsp;Only by spending more time with her could he find the evidence needed to prove that Ren Ziyuan was the same person as A-Jiao. &nbsp;In fact, Jiang Zhengkai had already requested his colleagues in the Household Registration Department to do a background check on Ren Ziyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right before it was time to clock out, Lu Xiaoqiang returned to the sub-bureau. &nbsp;He went directly to Jiang Zhengkai’s office and said, “Inspector Jiang, I’ve already looked into my sister’s account. &nbsp;One of the wires was initiated in Shigatse, Tibet. &nbsp;The rest were from this city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shigatse?” Jiang Zhengkai frowned in response. &nbsp;He knew A-Jiao had gone to Tibet a while back, but how did he not pick up on the fact that Ren Ziyuan liked to eat </span><i><span style>khapse</span></i><span style>? &nbsp;It was A-Jiao who brought the recipe back from Tibet and then had Uncle Cai start making them at his restaurant, but somehow Ren Ziyuan liked eating <i>khapse</i></span><span style>&nbsp;as well? &nbsp;That was far too convenient to be a coincidence, no?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Affirmative! &nbsp;I believe the wires weren’t sent by my sister! &nbsp;My sister never left this city after arriving here. &nbsp;There’s no way she would be all the way out in Tibet!” Lu Xiaoqiang confidently said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That… makes sense,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded his head, but he didn’t really feel like explaining to Lu Xiaoqiang that A-Jiao had visited Tibet. &nbsp;“Do you have any surveillance footage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The bank is going through their surveillance records, but we won’t be able to get anything today,” Lu Xiaoqiang answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai thought for a moment and then wrote down an address for Lu Xiaoqiang, “Here, before you come here tomorrow, I want you to go visit the Household Registration Department. &nbsp;Give them this address and have them track down the house’s owner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, Inspector Jiang,” Lu Xiaoqiang happily agreed. &nbsp;He saw Jiang Zhengkai had already gotten up and was preparing to leave, “Are you about to leave work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! &nbsp;I’ve got to spend the night with my… girlfriend,” Jiang Zhengkai smiled at Lu Xiaoqiang, “You need anything else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, I’d like to stand the night watch in the alley,” requested Lu Xiaoqiang, his face becoming beet red as he spoke. &nbsp;Needless to say, he already knew about his sister’s profession, but what of it? &nbsp;What could a barely educated young woman do to support her family other than selling her body? &nbsp;Did she realistically have any other choices?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you can go,” Jiang Zhengkai agreed as he slapped Lu Xiaoqiang on the shoulder, “The nights are cold, so wear some extra layers. &nbsp;Stay safe out there, and don’t stay too late!” &nbsp;After he finished his instructions, he left the office without a second thought. &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang’s request made him think of the dearly departed Wei Xin. &nbsp;He hoped she liked it up there in Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At five o’clock, Jiang Zhengkai parked his car in the preschool’s parking lot. &nbsp;He intentionally arrived half an hour earlier than A-Jiao expected. &nbsp;He wanted to observe A-Jiao’s work environment, especially her art studio. &nbsp;Perhaps it was there that he could find some evidence linking A-Jiao to Ren Ziyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello? &nbsp;Ziyuan? &nbsp;I’m here,” Jiang Zhengkai called A-Jiao on his cell phone while standing in front of the preschool’s main entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This early?” A-Jiao’s cheerful voice came over from the other side, “But I’m not done yet!” &nbsp;She then hesitated for a second before continuing, “It’s alright. &nbsp;I’ll come out to get you. &nbsp;You can come in and take a look at my art studio!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sounds good!” Jiang Zhengkai replied. &nbsp;It seemed like the gods were setting him up for success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait for me to come out then,” A-Jiao instructed before she hung up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within three minutes’ time, A-Jiao darted out of the preschool building. &nbsp;She had already told the security guard about Jiang Zhengkai, so she took him directly to the front desk to sign in. &nbsp;She then held Jiang Zhengkai’s arm and walked towards her art studio. &nbsp;Regardless of whether she was A-Jiao or Ren Ziyuan, this man would eventually become her husband, so there was absolutely no reason why she should be shy around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok, here’s my studio!” announced A-Jiao as she brought Jiang Zhengkai to a classroom on the first floor, “This is also where I teach my art classes at night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? &nbsp;It looks very beautiful,” complimented Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think so? &nbsp;Do you like it?” &nbsp;A-Jiao was very pleased by what Jiang Zhengkai had just said. &nbsp;“Why are you so good today, showing up early and all?” questioned A-Jiao as she sat back down in front of the easel, “I’m almost done with this painting. &nbsp;Can you wait there for a few minutes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai glanced at the canvas; it was a portrait. &nbsp;He had to admit A-Jiao was quite a talented painter. &nbsp;With each brushstroke, the person on the canvas seemed to come more and more into life. &nbsp;“You like painting portraits? &nbsp;How about you paint one of me one of these days?” joked Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup! &nbsp;In addition to portraits, I also like painting urban landscapes,” A-Jiao turned around and looked at Jiang Zhengkai with palette in hand, “Paint you? &nbsp;Sure! &nbsp;But you’ll have to marry me first!” &nbsp;She then puckered her lips and turned around to finish her painting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, that’s a bit too hefty of a price for a portrait, don’t you think?” Jiang Zhengkai chuckled as he responded, “What would happen to A-Jiao if I married you?” &nbsp;He purposely said this to her because he noticed something peculiar about this Ren Ziyuan: she wasn’t the slightest bit jealous when he brought up her romantic rival A-Jiao, and that was very abnormal behavior for a woman!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget about her! &nbsp;I’m sure she will find someone better than you,” replied A-Jiao as she painted, “Plus, didn’t she go into hiding? &nbsp;To get away from you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? &nbsp;How do you know she wants to get away from me? &nbsp;Am I really that bad?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he leaned on the podium while watching A-Jiao paint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because you told me, remember?” A-Jiao replied, “That storage rack over there has my previous works. &nbsp;You can go take a look if you’d like. &nbsp;It’s going to take a while longer for me to finish up here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not in a hurry,” said Jiang Zhengkai as he headed over towards the storage rack. &nbsp;Truth be told, even if she hadn’t told him to take a look at her previous paintings, he still would’ve done so. &nbsp;That was the real reason why he was in here in the first place!</span></p>
