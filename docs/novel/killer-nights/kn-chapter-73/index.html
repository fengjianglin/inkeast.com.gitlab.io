 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 73: Fantasy or Reality</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Jiang Zhengkai finished his shower and walked out of the bathroom, A-Jiao had already fallen asleep, sprawled out on her paintings. &nbsp;She slept very soundly, with a soft rhythmic snore from her nose. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai walked over to her and gently lifted her hair; it was starting to grow longer. &nbsp;Then he lowered his head to gently kiss her on the cheek, before he picked her up and moved her to the bed. &nbsp;At that moment, A-Jiao muttered in her sleep, “Stop messing around, I’ve got work to do…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Zhengkai heard what she said, a slight smile appeared on his face. &nbsp;He didn’t respond to her, because he knew she was just sleep talking. &nbsp;Even if he had responded, she wouldn’t have heard him. &nbsp;He placed A-Jiao on the bed and started to turn back to see what she’d &nbsp;written on the paintings, but A-Jiao actually turned around and hugged him tightly. &nbsp;She continued to say softly in her sleep, “Hold me, Honey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai stopped at the sound of her plea, and he lay down contentedly next to A-Jiao. &nbsp;He then carefully looked at her young, beautiful face. &nbsp;He liked watching A-Jiao sleep. &nbsp;He didn’t know why, he just knew he liked the way she looked when she was asleep. &nbsp;He wasn’t sure how long it was before he fell asleep as well. &nbsp;Did A-Jiao had some special power that allowed Jiang Zhengkai to forget about his work when she was with him? &nbsp;Or was it perhaps that A-Jiao truly was what mattered most to him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time Jiang Zhengkai opened his eyes the next morning, A-Jiao was already wide awake. &nbsp;“Hi Honey, are you awake?” A-Jiao turned around and looked at him when she heard his movements on the bed. &nbsp;“Sorry, I didn’t get a chance to finish writing the descriptions on the paintings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, don’t worry about it!” Jiang Zhengkai replied. &nbsp;“Sleep some more. &nbsp;I’m not in a rush.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That won’t do!” A-Jiao shook her head. &nbsp;“If my Honey wants something done, I’m going to do it right away!” &nbsp;She turned around and started writing on the portraits. &nbsp;“You’re the one who should keep sleeping, Honey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have it your way!” replied Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;However, instead of lying back down, he sat up on the bed. &nbsp;He wasn’t a lazy person. &nbsp;If A-Jiao was working, especially working on something for him, he couldn’t simply lie down and go back to sleep. &nbsp;He soon stood up and made the bed. &nbsp;Meanwhile, A-Jiao sat in front of her vanity, clearly concentrating heavily on something. &nbsp;When whatever it was finally came to her, she wrote something on the painting. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at her for a while, before deciding not to bother her while she worked. &nbsp;He quietly went to the bathroom to brush his teeth, and then went to the kitchen to cook breakfast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After breakfast, Jiang Zhengkai drove A-Jiao to the preschool. &nbsp;Per his usual routine, he watched her disappear into the schoolhouse before leaving. &nbsp;Today, however, he had a thick roll of paintings in his hand, now with A-Jiao’s added captions. &nbsp;She’d spent the entire morning writing the descriptions that he’d requested on the paintings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai took the portraits back to his office. &nbsp;He carefully placed them on his desk and then went to find Mu Mingyuan at the Material Evidence Division. &nbsp;He wanted to borrow an easel on which to place the paintings. &nbsp;He didn’t really need to be so careful with these oil paintings, but he felt like he had to, because A-Jiao had spent a lot of time and effort to provide the information he’d wanted. &nbsp;Therefore, he took great care to ensure that these portraits wouldn’t get a single scratch while under his care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finished getting the easel, Jiang Zhengkai clipped the portraits to it before sitting down in his chair. &nbsp;He focused intently on each and every portrait. &nbsp;Between A-Jiao’s drawings and her descriptions, he felt as if he knew the life story of each of the women in the portraits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After lunch, Lu Xiaoqiang wandered into Jiang Zhengkai’s office. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, A-Ju’s autopsy report just came back. &nbsp;According to the results of the autopsy, the coroner concluded that the cause of death was drug overdose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I see,” acknowledged Jiang Zhengkai with a slight nod of his head; he otherwise remained there motionless. &nbsp;“Oh, right, Xiaoqiang! &nbsp;Give Zhang Nan a call. &nbsp;I want him to place A-Shun in solitary confinement. &nbsp;But tell him to make sure A-Shun is safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Obviously, Jiang Zhengkai spent a good portion of the morning thinking about what to do with A-Shun. &nbsp;According to standard procedure, he should instruct Zhang Nan to transfer custody of A-Shun to the sub-bureau. &nbsp;When Jiang Zhengkai discovered that A-Xiu had looked just like the woman he saw underneath the bed the night of A-Xiu’s death, he already had reason enough to request the transfer, even if the reasoning was based on something of a fantastical vision. &nbsp;The reason why he didn’t request the transfer is because he still believed A-Xiu’s case had some connection with the vice squad. &nbsp;But what exactly was her relationship with the vice squad? &nbsp;This was something that Jiang Zhengkai had to consider in his calculations. &nbsp;If he transferred custody of A-Shun right now, he might unwittingly instigate a conflict within the police bureau, which might jeopardize A-Shun’s safety or adversely affect the case. &nbsp;At the end of the day, Jiang Zhengkai no longer trusted everyone inside the police bureau. &nbsp;Based on the above reasoning, although Zhang Nan’s station didn’t have as many resources as the sub-bureau, it was definitely more low-key and therefore safer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, Inspector Jiang,” acknowledged Lu Xiaoqiang, before he turned around to leave. &nbsp;However, Jiang Zhengkai called him back. &nbsp;“Xiaoqiang, come over here and take a look at this painting.” &nbsp;As Lu Xiaoqiang was turning around, Jiang Zhengkai placed another portrait on top. &nbsp;He pointed at the portrait and asked Lu Xiaoqiang, “Who does she look like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s my sister!” &nbsp;As soon as Lu Xiaoqiang glanced at the portrait, his face displayed an expression of shock. &nbsp;He couldn’t help but open his mouth wide in surprise as these words slipped out of his mouth. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang! &nbsp;The resemblance is uncanny! &nbsp;Who drew it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I unwittingly found it,” said Jiang Zhengkai as he waved his hand and shifted his gaze to Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“Alright, go ahead and carry out my orders! &nbsp;Wait… let’s go see Zhang Nan together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Xiaoqiang felt like he understood Jiang Zhengkai’s orders, and yet somehow they still didn’t actually make sense. &nbsp;He didn’t understand why Jiang Zhengkai told him to wait, so he decided to go ahead and call Zhang Nan when he saw Jiang Zhengkai’s attention had returned to the portraits. &nbsp;Were those portraits the only things on his mind, or had he perhaps discovered some important leads?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lu Xiaoqiang called Zhang Nan, he didn’t return to Jiang Zhengkai’s office to bother him any further. &nbsp;As for Jiang Zhengkai, he sat there and looked like he had no intention to get up anytime soon. &nbsp;It appeared as if Lu Xiaoqiang had correctly interpreted Jiang Zhengkai’s orders: he wanted Lu Xiaoqiang to call Zhang Nan first, but then visit Zhang Nan sometime later, not right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the wall clock struck three, Jiang Zhengkai finally got out of his chair. &nbsp;He plucked a few of the portraits from the easel, rolled them up, and then left his office. &nbsp;“Xiaoqiang, did you make that call yet?” he absentmindedly asked as he stood next to the rookie cop’s desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector,” Lu Xiaoqiang answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let’s go!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai pointed his hand at the door. &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang immediately got up and followed him out the door as the two of them left the sub-bureau together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The distance from the sub-bureau to the Ju’an Road Police Station wasn’t far; it normally took about ten minutes to drive there. &nbsp;On the road, Jiang Zhengkai kept furrowing his brows. &nbsp;He was clearly still thinking about whatever was on his mind. &nbsp;It seemed that there was something he had difficulty explaining, and for which he had no answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you doing here, Jiang?” Zhang Nan asked in surprise as the door to his office opened and Lu Xiaoqiang and Jiang Zhengkai both walked in. &nbsp;“Didn’t you already have Lu call me? &nbsp;I’ve already made the arrangements for A-Shun according to your instructions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, hehe! &nbsp;Well, there are some new developments that I wanted to go over with them,” Jiang Zhengkai smiled politely in response to Zhang Nan’s question. &nbsp;“Oh right, Zhang, have your guys work with Xiaoqiang to prepare the interrogation room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” &nbsp;Zhang Nan knew at once that Jiang Zhengkai wanted to speak to him in private; making Lu Xiaoqiang help prep the interrogation room was just a pretext to send him away. &nbsp;Zhang Nan got up, walked over to the entrance of his office, and called to one of his officers, “Guo Wei, come over here! &nbsp;Go help Lu from the sub-bureau to setup the interrogation room. &nbsp;Inspector Jiang wants to use it later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lu Xiaoqiang had left, Jiang Zhengkai took out the roll of paintings and spread them out on the coffee table in Zhang Nan’s office. &nbsp;“Zhang, come over here and take a look. &nbsp;See if you recognize them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” replied Zhang Nan. &nbsp;He walked over to the coffee table, looked at the portraits, and said, “This one is A-Mei… this one is A-Sha… and… yes! &nbsp;This one was the girl with A-Sha, the one who just died, A-Xue!” &nbsp;As Jiang Zhengkai flipped through the portraits, Zhang Nan effortlessly recognized everyone in the portraits as women from the alley. &nbsp;Finally, Jiang Zhengkai took out the last portrait and placed it in front of Zhang Nan. &nbsp;Zhang Nan responded without even thinking very hard, “That’s A-Xiu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That really is A-Xiu?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai calmly looked at Zhang Nan. &nbsp;“You’re sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I arrested her and questioned her before, so of course I’m sure!” Zhang Nan responded with laughter at Jiang Zhengkai’s question. &nbsp;“She was a tough woman to deal with. &nbsp;When I questioned her… that’s right, she had that exact expression! &nbsp;That woman… she was a tough nut to crack!” &nbsp;Finally, Zhang Nan sighed. &nbsp;“Who drew these? &nbsp;They look so real!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So she really is A-Xiu…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai sat back in the sofa. &nbsp;He sighed with seeming relief, but it looked like another burden had fallen on his shoulders all the same. &nbsp;“How could she be A-Xiu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong, Jiang?” &nbsp;Zhang Nan looked at Jiang Zhengkai’s expression and realized there was a hidden meaning behind his words. &nbsp;He asked uneasily, “What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I keep on having this feeling that I saw the woman in this portrait, on the night A-Xiu died,” Jiang Zhengkai said. &nbsp;He turned his head and looked at Zhang Nan, confusion written all over his face.</span></p>
