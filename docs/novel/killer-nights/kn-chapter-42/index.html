 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Killer Nights</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 42: My Dad Is Li Gang</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Time passed second by second, minute by minute. &nbsp;When the clock turned to 8:20, the alarm on Jiang Zhengkai’s alarm went off. &nbsp;As the alarm rang on, he finally shifted his attention away from A-Jiao’s window. &nbsp;Yes, it’s time to pick up Ren Ziyuan. &nbsp;As this thought entered into his mind, he hesitated for a bit before starting the car again and driving off into the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the preschool, the children were just about wrapping up at A-Jiao’s evening tutor class. &nbsp;Parents and guardians waiting to pick up their children lined the preschool’s halls. &nbsp;A-Jiao very carefully turned over each child to their respective caregivers and then had each of them sign out on the attendance log. &nbsp;Ever since Feng Lina was abducted and attacked, A-Jiao added this extra precaution for her students. &nbsp;Even though she knew A-Tao had taken care of that sick pervert, nobody could guarantee that something like that wouldn’t happen again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she was done with everything at the preschool, it was already 8:30. &nbsp;A-Jiao gathered her belongings and walked out the preschool’s front door. &nbsp;She stood outside and looked all over, but Jiang Zhengkai’s car never came into sight. &nbsp;She looked down at her purse and took out her cell phone. &nbsp;It was already past 8:30. &nbsp;She bit her lips and leaned on the outer walls of the preschool, muttering, “Ai! &nbsp;Looks like I still haven’t replaced A-Jiao in Uncle Policeman’s heart...” &nbsp;She didn’t know if she should be happy or sad at that fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Jiang Zhengkai had parked his car at a byroad not far from the preschool. &nbsp;The only thing that stopped him from going further was a feeling that accepting Ren Ziyuan’s advances meant that he was somehow betraying A-Jiao. &nbsp;He only loved A-Jiao, even though this Ren Ziyuan woman looked almost identical to A-Jiao. &nbsp;Still, they were two different people, so almost the same wasn’t the same as exactly the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is class over, Miss Ren?” &nbsp;A BMW pulled up beside A-Jiao, and Li Hongbin’s head popped out from inside the car, “Hop in! &nbsp;I’ll give you a lift.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey hey, look who it is!” A-Jiao said sarcastically while her body continued to lean up against the preschool’s wall, “My dear Prince Xu, don’t you have to be with Cui Jing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her? &nbsp;Naw,” Li Hongbin shook his head, while a great big smile appeared on his face, “Miss Ren, you know I’ve always liked you.” &nbsp;As he spoke, he grabbed a large bouquet of roses from the passenger seat. &nbsp;It looks like this fellow came well prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” &nbsp;A-Jiao’s face lit up with a bright smile, and her normally shallow dimples became deeper than usual. &nbsp;“I guess a thank you is in order for you, Brother Xu,” she said to Li Hongbin with a softness that was unique to the female sex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t… mention… don’t mention it.” &nbsp;Seeing A-Jiao acting that way caused Li Hongbin to nervously gulp down a mouthful of air. &nbsp;A former prostitute finding the right words to seduce a dirty-minded playboy was practically a walk in the park.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… I must respectfully decline,” A-Jiao said as her face immediately hardened, “Why don’t you go back to your Cui Jing? &nbsp;Don’t think I won’t tell her about what you did tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha…” Li Hongbin let out a malicious cackle upon hearing what A-Jiao said. &nbsp;Apparently, A-Jiao had underestimated the level of Li Hongbin’s shamelessness. &nbsp;Li Hongbin had long lusted with a fiery passion for A-Jiao, so it was without surprise that he didn’t heed her warning. &nbsp;In his eyes, all the women in the world were just his personal playthings. &nbsp;If he wanted A-Jiao, then he wouldn’t stop until he had her. &nbsp;He got out of his BMW and walked over to A-Jiao. &nbsp;He then stuck his arm out onto the preschool wall near where A-Jiao’s ear was and said in a low voice, “Ziyuan, let’s go play together. &nbsp;Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to treat you right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” &nbsp;A-Jiao slowly moved her hands in front of her body and bent one of her legs so that the heel touched the wall. &nbsp;She was already preparing herself for a sudden attack by Li Hongbin. &nbsp;Fending off these sissy playboy types was as easy as taking candy from a baby. &nbsp;A-Jiao pushed her face next to Li Hongbin’s and said, “Brother Xu, Heaven gave you a handsome face, but the only use you’ve found for it is for seducing women?” &nbsp;After she finished speaking, A-Jiao leaned her head back against the wall and started giggling uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though what A-Jiao said was quite mean, Li Hongbin wasn’t put off because he had been entranced by A-Jiao’s girly laughter. &nbsp;He leapt right at A-Jiao’s body, but suddenly there was a cry of “ow!” &nbsp;When the two bodies collided, Li Hongbin shrieked like a pig at the slaughterhouse. &nbsp;He then used both his hands to grab his private parts as he struggled to stay standing. &nbsp;Obviously, A-Jiao used her already bent leg to kick this man in his junk right when he was closest to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You fucking bitch!” Li Hongbin cursed A-Jiao even as he vigorously rubbed his nuts. &nbsp;Apparently, A-Jiao had one mean kick. &nbsp;Still, with Li Hongbin right beside her, A-Jiao was careful not to turn her back on him. &nbsp;She knew that a humiliated spoiled brats like Li Hongbin was capable of doing just about anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some distance away, Jiang Zhengkai saw everything that was happening. &nbsp;He got out of his police cruiser and quickly ran towards where A-Jiao and Li Hongbin were. &nbsp;However, when he was still approximately 20 meters away, Li Hongbin stood up once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You little whore!” Li Hongbin muttered as he came for A-Jiao again. &nbsp;A-Jiao jumped out of the way, which caused Li Hongbin to faceplant into the ground. &nbsp;Even though A-Jiao was very quick on her feet, she knew that successfully evading a healthy young man was no simple feat. &nbsp;As the two of them continued their “dance,” another man suddenly jumped out from behind Li Hongbin. &nbsp;He punched Li Hongbin straight in the back of the head and then kicked him right in the crotch. &nbsp;“Ow ah!” Li Hongbin let out a strange cry as he fell to the ground. &nbsp;“Yah!” screamed the other man as he savagely kicked Li Hongbin in the belly before stomping on it. &nbsp;“Ah, oi!” Li Hongbin made a string of pig-like noises as the other man continued his assault.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Meng, stop!” A-Jiao yelled in panic just as the man bent down and raised his fist in preparation to strike Li Hongbin’s temple. &nbsp;“Stop! &nbsp;You’re going to kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You stupid son of a bitch! &nbsp;Do you know who I am?” Li Hongbin shouted in between sobs while lying on the ground, “My dad is Li Gang!” &nbsp;(Translator’s note: “My dad is Li Gang” is a popular catchphrase in China. &nbsp;Google it if you want to know the origin of that catchphrase.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Gang?” A-Meng coolly responded to Li Hongbin, “Haha, then my dad is Qin Shihuang (aka the First Emperor)!” &nbsp;As he spoke, A-Meng punched Li Hongbin’s face again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, oi!” &nbsp;Li Hongbin cried again as he spit out three of his teeth. &nbsp;Clearly, A-Meng was not deterred by Li Hongbin’s claim that Li Gang was his father. &nbsp;Furthermore, A-Meng had no idea who the hell Li Gang even was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on here?” asked two police officers as they exited from a patrolling squad car. &nbsp;They first looked at the prone Li Hongbin and then looked at A-Meng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing his saviors, Li Hongbin tried to hurriedly speak out of his busted up mouth, “Thank God… officers… he… he...” &nbsp;Unfortunately, he was missing three teeth, so speaking coherently wasn’t exactly his forte right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officers! &nbsp;He molested me!” A-Jiao interjected as she rushed up to place herself between the two police officers and A-Meng. &nbsp;A-Meng still had one foot on Li Hongbin’s belly, and he couldn’t care less what the police officers wanted. &nbsp;Per his hand-to-hand combat skills, he could easily take on four police officers, not to mention two, as long as they didn’t draw their sidearms, that is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, this lady is telling the truth,” Jiang Zhengkai said as he walked over and flashed his badge at the two beat cops. &nbsp;“I saw everything. &nbsp;Just two young guys fighting over a girl. &nbsp;Happens all the time.” &nbsp;A-Meng didn’t know who Li Gang was, but Jiang Zhengkai sure did. &nbsp;If A-Meng ended up at the station tonight, he would be in a world of hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that right?” &nbsp;The two patrolmen looked at Jiang Zhengkai’s badge and then looked again at Li Hongbin, “Is that what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” &nbsp;Li Hongbin felt the pressure on his belly increasing, so he had no choice but to concur, “Yes… that’s right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can remove that foot now,” Jiang Zhengkai glanced at A-Meng, “There’s no need to beat someone up that badly! &nbsp;You guys know each other, so you’ll have to make up eventually.” &nbsp;Upon hearing what Jiang Zhengkai had said, Li Gang complied with his demand and removed his foot from Li Hongbin’s body. &nbsp;He then tilted his head and looked at Li Hongbin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to file a report?” the police officers asked Li Hongbin, who was still lying on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! &nbsp;We’re all… friends,” Li Hongbin spoke with a slight lisp caused by his missing teeth. &nbsp;He might be a good-for-nothing playboy, but he wasn’t stupid. &nbsp;Even though his father was the commander of a police sub-bureau, this place wasn’t in his father’s precinct. &nbsp;He knew that if he went into the station to file a report, then there was a good chance he would also be investigated for molesting A-Jiao, and he was reasonably certain he wouldn’t be able to get off scot free either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let’s go then!” &nbsp;The two patrol officers looked at each other, saluted Jiang Zhengkai, then got in their squad car and left the scene.</span></p>
