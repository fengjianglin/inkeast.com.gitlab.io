 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 22: The Taiwanese Noodle Shop</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, time always manages to fly away without one ever noticing. &nbsp;Wei Xin spent three full days investigating the couple who had been killed in the latest homicide. &nbsp;Finally, on the fourth day, her full investigation report found its way onto Jiang Zhengkai’s desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The male victim’s name was Zhu Yuping. &nbsp;He was a physics teacher at a local middle school. &nbsp;He was described as dutiful and honest, and although he taught a subject in the sciences, he was also quite fond of traditional Chinese calligraphy, and so had very beautiful handwriting. &nbsp;Therefore, every Chinese New Year, all of his colleagues and neighbors would ask him to write them blessing scrolls that they could paste on their doors and windows. &nbsp;He was well-liked, and no one who knew him spoke ill of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female victim’s name was Yin Zhumei. &nbsp;She was a nurse at the local general hospital and the wife of Zhu Yuping. &nbsp;She was also beautiful, clever, and competent, although she did have a bit of a temper. &nbsp;Nevertheless, she excelled at work, so everyone in her department spoke highly of her positive attitude and enthusiasm. &nbsp;The only negative aspect about her that Wei Xin was able to dig up was a rumor that she was romantically involved with a surgeon named Yu Di.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu Di, surgeon…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai turned things over in his head as he read the report. &nbsp;Could it be that this Yu Di was the serial killer? &nbsp;He looked up at Wei Xin. &nbsp;“This Yu Di, what shift did he have on the night of the murder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was his day off,” Wei Xin replied. &nbsp;“I also compared his work schedule with the other murders, and it looked like he was off on the days of the other murders as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that right?” Jiang Zhengkai asked. &nbsp;However, he still had some doubts. &nbsp;Yu Di might have had a motive to kill Zhu Yuping and Yin Zhumei, but what about the previous murders? &nbsp;What would his motives have been for those?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we bring in Yu Di?” Wei Xin suggested as she looked at Jiang Zhengkai’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which shift is he on today?” asked Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s on the night shift today,” Wei Xin double checked her notebooks before answering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you and I will go to the hospital tonight to take a look at this suspect of ours.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai decided it would best not to take any actions that would alert the suspect. &nbsp;Therefore, he wanted to visit the area himself, to see just what type of person this Yu Di was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it was time for dinner, Wei Xin returned to Jiang Zhengkai’s office and quietly knocked on the door. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, it’s time for dinner. &nbsp;Want to join me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, yeah, sounds good,” Jiang Zhengkai replied as he got up from his chair. &nbsp;“Alright, let’s go grab some dinner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you like to eat?” Wei Xin asked with a sweet smile. &nbsp;“I’m good with just about everything. &nbsp;How about I buy you a bowl of noodles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noodles?” &nbsp;Hearing that word took Jiang Zhengkai’s mind back to another time and place.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Uncle Cai! &nbsp;Can you get us two bowls of hand-cut noodles?”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Well, I’m back, aren’t I? &nbsp;And I missed you too, Uncle Cai!”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“So you’re saying every time I bring a man, you’re going to pay for my meal?”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Uncle Cai! &nbsp;Did you see that? &nbsp;He stole all of my flour paste...”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang?” &nbsp;Wei Xin waved her hand in front of Jiang Zhengkai’s face. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I… I’m okay. &nbsp;Let’s go!” Jiang Zhengkai said, as his train of thought returned to the present. &nbsp;It had been a long time since he’d last seen A-Jiao. &nbsp;Humans are peculiar animals. &nbsp;When A-Jiao had been with him, he’d all but ignored her, but now that she was gone, he found himself constantly thinking about her. &nbsp;In fact, a part of him felt as if he had lost the most precious thing in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Wei Xin’s guidance, Jiang Zhengkai walked into an authentic Taiwanese noodle shop. &nbsp;The waiter politely led the two of them to a table. &nbsp;They sat facing each other on a pair of soft-cushioned chairs. &nbsp;The entire place had a very warm and gentle ambience. &nbsp;Even the music being played gave off a soft and velvety feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What will you two guests be having tonight?” the waiter asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me a bowl of hand-cut noodles!” Jiang Zhengkai crisply answered without even looking at the menu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sir, but we don’t have hand-cut noodles here,” the waiter replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I see,” Jiang Zhengkai said with a frown, before looking over at Wei Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, do you eat cow tendon?” Wei Xin quickly came to the rescue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In that case, give us two bowls of cow tendon noodles: half tendon, half meat,” Wei Xin placed the order with the waiter. &nbsp;“And also, give us a side of seasoned beef, a side of seasoned tripe, and a side of squid balls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good. &nbsp;Anything else for you two?” the waiter asked after writing down Wei Xin’s order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh right, give me a bowl of fermented flour paste,” Jiang Zhengkai spoke up again, after seeing Wei Xin had finished placing the order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry… we don’t have fermented flour paste either,” the waiter awkwardly answered Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“My apologies, but we’re a Taiwanese-style noodle joint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, what? &nbsp;Taiwanese don’t eat flour paste?” Jiang Zhengkai asked the waiter in shock. He reached over and gulped down a mouthful of water from a glass on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” the waiter nodded. &nbsp;He sheepishly added, “Also, that water there is used to rinse tableware… but don’t worry! &nbsp;That water’s clean!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay! &nbsp;Just go already!” &nbsp;Wei Xin saw the weird look on Jiang Zhengkai’s face and lost no time in sending the waiter away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherfuck! &nbsp;Maybe I like drinking rinsing water!” Jiang Zhengkai cursed as soon as the waiter had left. &nbsp;He proceeded to chug down the entire cup of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang! &nbsp;That water’s…” Wei Xin started as she watched Jiang Zhengkai down the entire cup. She nervously yelled, “Not clean! &nbsp;Waiter, waiter! &nbsp;Give us two cups of orange juice!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at the empty cup in his hand and forcefully threw it aside. &nbsp;However, in the glass’s reflection, he felt as if he could see A-Jiao’s face. &nbsp;She was already convulsing with laughter. &nbsp;“</span><i><span style>Haha, you idiot! &nbsp;That’s rinsing water! &nbsp;Haha!</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong, Inspector Jiang?” &nbsp;From across the table, Wei Xin looked at Jiang Zhengkai staring blankly at an empty cup. &nbsp;She nervously laughed and asked, “Are you not feeling well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m fine,” Jiang Zhengkai regained his composure. &nbsp;“I’m sorry for making a fool of myself. &nbsp;It’s just my first time in a Taiwanese noodle shop,” he said with a shrug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you prefer hand-cut noodles?” Wei Xin asked Jiang Zhengkai, her cheeks blushing. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, you shouldn’t always eat street stall food. &nbsp;That food’s not clean. &nbsp;You’ll get sick if you eat too much of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, you’re right,” Jiang Zhengkai rigorously nodded his head. &nbsp;However, there was another girl’s voice whispering in his ear. </span><i><span style>“Did you used to be a kindergarten teacher or something?”</span></i><span style> &nbsp;A sly smile soon spread across his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At around 10 o’clock that evening, Jiang Zhengkai parked his car outside the hospital where Yu Di worked. &nbsp;He looked at Wei Xin sitting beside him. &nbsp;“When we go in,” he said softly, “I’m going to pretend to be a patient. &nbsp;I’ll try to figure out a way to get Yu Di’s fingerprint or hair sample.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, Inspector Jiang,” Wei Xin replied. &nbsp;A split second later, Jiang Zhengkai grabbed a hold of his left thumb and pulled on it with all his might. &nbsp;A </span><i><span style>crack</span></i><span style> sound came from his hand as he successfully dislocated his thumb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang!” Wei Xin yelled nervously. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just waved his hand. &nbsp;“Let’s go!” &nbsp;By now, cold sweat had already appeared on his forehead. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Damn, it hurts like hell!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were successfully admitted to the emergency room. &nbsp;They walked in the direction of the emergency surgery call room, but as they rounded the corner, they heard the sound of a man and a woman frolicking inside the call room. &nbsp;Mixed in with the noises was the woman softly calling for help. &nbsp;The call room’s door then suddenly flung open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai quickly pulled Wei Xin back, and the two of them hid behind the corner for a while. &nbsp;They soon heard the sound of footsteps down the hallway, which grew fainter and fainter. &nbsp;Clearly, the people who had come out of the call room were walking in the opposite direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, that’s Yu Di right there,” Wei Xin quietly whispered to Jiang Zhengkai as she pointed out the male doctor walking in front of them. &nbsp;The man looked to be about 5’9”, and was well-proportioned, at least when viewed from the back, but was definitely not muscular in any sense of the word. &nbsp;He held the female nurse’s hand in his own, and her body twisted back and forth as she followed Yu Di down the hallway. &nbsp;However, she kept making quiet laughter and playful calls for help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on, let’s follow them,” Jiang Zhengkai said softly. &nbsp;He paused to pop his thumb back into its socket. &nbsp;With things developing the way they were, there was no longer a need to feign injury. &nbsp;The more important thing right now was to find out what those two were up to!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Di and the woman next to him obviously did not catch on to the fact that they were being followed. &nbsp;The two of them arrived at the hospital’s pharmacy, laughing all the way. &nbsp;Soon after they entered the pharmacy, the door closed behind them with a soft </span><i><span style>click</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
