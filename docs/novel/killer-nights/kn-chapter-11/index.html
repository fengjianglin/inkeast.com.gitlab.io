 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 11: Uncle Cai's Noodle Shop</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai parked his police cruiser next to the post office and carried A-Jiao to the ATM there. &nbsp;It was dark outside, which meant it was well past the post office’s working hours, so the only way to retrieve money was by using the ATM. &nbsp;This time, however, A-Jiao stopped Jiang Zhengkai from following her to the ATM terminal. “No peeping while I type in my PIN!” she said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai chuckled to himself and sensibly took a few steps away from the ATM. &nbsp;He looked at his watch: 6:46 PM. &nbsp;Even a girl as smart as A-Jiao was had her blind spots. &nbsp;Perhaps she’d forgotten that Jiang Zhengkai was a police officer? &nbsp;If he really wanted to know where she was wiring the money to, did she think he wouldn’t have a way of finding out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m done here!” A-Jiao exclaimed as she turned away from the ATM terminal. &nbsp;She pointed at a nearby noodle shop. “But I also want to get a bowl of noodles over at that noodle shop. &nbsp;If you agree to eat with me, I promise to return to the hospital as soon as we’re done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai saw the stubborn look on A-Jiao’s face and decided to not oppose this slight change in plans. “Sounds good. &nbsp;Dinner’s on me then!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m buying!” A-Jiao objected. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I guess you’re buying then.” &nbsp;As soon as he finished talking, he immediately picked up A-Jiao and started walking towards the noodle shop. &nbsp;It didn’t make sense to drive over, since the noodle shop was only thirty or forty meters away from the post office. &nbsp;Besides, Jiang Zhengkai wasn’t exactly keen on being seen coming out of a cop car and entering a noodle shop with a known prostitute in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Cai! &nbsp;Can you get us two bowls of hand-cut noodles?” A-Jiao shouted towards the kitchen as soon as Jiang Zhengkai carried her inside the noodle shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coming right up!” Uncle Cai answered as he came running out. “Where have you been these last few days, kid? &nbsp;I missed the hell out of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I’m back, aren’t I? &nbsp;And I missed you too, Uncle Cai!” A-Jiao said to Uncle Cai with pouted lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I bet you missed my noodles more though, right?” Uncle Cai playfully retorted. &nbsp;But then he noticed A-Jiao was wearing a hospital gown underneath her coat. &nbsp;“What happened, A-Jiao? &nbsp;Are you sick? &nbsp;Did you boyfriend beat you?” Uncle Cai asked as he shot a glance at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gosh, no! &nbsp;I’m perfectly fine!” A-Jiao said while rolling her eyes. &nbsp;She shook Uncle Cai’s arm and said, “I don’t have a boyfriend, Uncle Cai! &nbsp;So stop spreading rumors and go cook us some noodles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright!” Uncle Cai acquiesced, but before he went back to the kitchen, he remembered to give Jiang Zhengkai a word of warning. “Young man, A-Jiao is a good lass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!” Jiang Zhengkai simply laughed and said nothing. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Just how good could a prostitute girl be anyway</span></i><span style>? he thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you laughing at?” &nbsp;A-Jiao shook her fist in Jiang Zhengkai’s face. &nbsp;“This is my turf. &nbsp;You might be a cop, but you </span><i><span style>will</span></i><span style> respect my authority in this part of town!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay, you win!” Jiang Zhengkai said while pretending to be scared. “Do you come to eat here often? &nbsp;I can see you’re quite popular around here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, ever since Xiaomei… oh, nevermind.” A-Jiao waved her hand next to her mouth. “Let’s not talk about these things over the dinner table.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, here you go!” Uncle Cai shouted. &nbsp;“Two bowls of noodles, a serving of fermented flour paste, a plate of beef, and a bottle of beer.” &nbsp;He came to their table with a pile of food. &nbsp;“Your meal tonight is on the house, so eat up!” he said as he immediately headed back into the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, Uncle Cai! &nbsp;We can’t accept this!” A-Jiao shouted loudly from her chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, don’t worry! &nbsp;I’m just in a good mood today!” Uncle Cai replied from the kitchen. “As long as you bring your boyfriend here, I’ll treat you to dinner again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you’re saying every time I bring a man, you’re going to pay for my meal?” A-Jiao teased him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup, that’s exactly what I’m saying!” Uncle Cai answered from the kitchen. “If you bring a man with you, I’m paying for your meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I’m totally going to bankrupt you then,” A-Jiao muttered softly, sticking out her tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You--” Jiang Zhengkai had a smile on his face and was just about to say something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You shut up!” A-Jiao blurted out. &nbsp;She pointed her chopsticks at Jiang Zhengkai and whispered, “Don’t you dare ruin my positive reputation here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, okay, got it,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides, nothing good comes out of your mouth anyway,” A-Jiao said under her breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai put down his chopsticks and peered intently at A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said hurry up and eat!” &nbsp;A-Jiao picked up a piece of beef and shoved it directly in Jiang Zhengkai’s mouth. &nbsp;Then she poured some of the flour paste that Uncle Cai had brought over directly into her noodle bowl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t eat that much salt yet!” Jiang Zhengkai reminded her after he gulped down the piece of beef.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, mister big-shot police officer,” A-Jiao said impatiently. “Did you used to be a kindergarten teacher or something? &nbsp;Is that why you’re treating me like a child?” &nbsp;Ignoring him, she simply poured a third of the whole helping of fermented flour paste into her bowl. &nbsp;When Jiang Zhengkai noticed, he didn’t back down either, and poured the rest of the paste straight into his own bowl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Cai! &nbsp;Did you see that? &nbsp;He stole all of my flour paste!” A-Jiao shouted at the top of her lungs while pointing at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai took in the girl in front of him. &nbsp;If she didn’t work in that alley, she would’ve been a regular bubbly girl next door. &nbsp;Perhaps she carried too much pain in her heart, or perhaps her family was too desperate for money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s all this fuss about? &nbsp;Are you guys fighting over who gets more flour paste?” Uncle Cai said as he walked out of the kitchen, holding another full bowl of fermented flour paste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Cai, A-Jiao’s doctor said she can’t eat too much salt right now,” Jiang Zhengkai anxiously pointed out to their host.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see,” Uncle Cai nodded. &nbsp;He looked over at A-Jiao and said, “Did you hear that? &nbsp;Your body is still recovering, so you can’t have any more flour paste. &nbsp;I’ll just hold on to this bowl of paste for now. &nbsp;I’ll give it to you next time you’re here, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!” A-Jiao pouted. &nbsp;She muttered quietly, “All men suck. &nbsp;The two of you barely know each other, and you’re already teaming up against me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the clock approached 8:00, A-Jiao finally finished eating her bowl of noodles. &nbsp;She stealthily folded a hundred-yuan note into a neat square and hid it underneath her bowl. &nbsp;Then she summoned all the energy in her body to stand up and said, “Uncle Cai! &nbsp;Take care! &nbsp;I’m heading out now!” &nbsp;As she finished, she looked at Jiang Zhengkai and playfully spread out her arms once again. “Get over here and pick me up! &nbsp;We have to leave before Uncle Cai finds the money I left on the table!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Uncle Cai came out of the kitchen, saw Jiang Zhengkai carry A-Jiao out of the restaurant, and shook his head. “And she says he’s not her boyfriend. &nbsp;Sigh… young people these days.” &nbsp;He walked over to the table where A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai had been eating and started clearing the dishes. &nbsp;The hundred-yuan note appeared from underneath A-Jiao’s bowl, and Uncle Cai’s face lit up with a smile. “That damn lass! &nbsp;So this is how you want to do it, huh? &nbsp;I’ll kick you straight out of my restaurant the next time you show your face here.” &nbsp;But despite his gruff talk, his affection for A-Jiao only grew deeper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I had no idea big brother police officer could run away so quickly!” A-Jiao said facetiously with a pat on Jiang Zhengkai’s shoulder as the two of them arrived at his police cruiser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Back in my day…” Jiang Zhengkai paused and gave A-Jiao a good look. “I think I won first place in the hundred-meter sprint when I was right around your age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” A-Jiao looked at Jiang Zhengkai with curled lips. “Ha! &nbsp;From the sound of it, I shouldn’t be calling you big brother police officer anymore. &nbsp;So, big </span><i><span style>uncle</span></i><span style> police officer, may I know how old you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You certainly may not!” he impatiently responded. &nbsp;He immediately turned on the car engine and drove to the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai escorted A-Jiao back to her hospital room. &nbsp;She lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. &nbsp;Clearly, today’s outing had taxed her strength a great deal. &nbsp;As Jiang Zhengkai sat down and looked at the woman sleeping on the hospital bed, a faint smile emerged on his face. &nbsp;At that moment, he even thought, </span><i><span style>It would be so nice if this woman didn’t have to leave the hospital. &nbsp;Wouldn’t it be nice if she stayed in this hospital room forever?</span></i><span style> &nbsp;But he knew that as soon as A-Jiao’s wounds healed, she would be back out on that dimly lit alley turning tricks once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the moment was ruined by the sudden ringing of his cell phone. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked down and saw it was Zhang Nan’s number. &nbsp;He got up, walked out of the hospital room, and answered the phone. “Hello. &nbsp;This is Jiang Zhengkai.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang! &nbsp;We’ve got another incident on our hands!” Zhang Nan said through the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the situation?” Jiang Zhengkai asked in surprise. &nbsp;Deep down in his heart, he had a hunch that there’d been another murder in the alley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve just had another similar homicide, below the floor where the last homicide occurred!” Zhang Nan sounded noticeably on edge. “You should come here right away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it! &nbsp;I’ll be there in ten mikes.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai hung up the phone and raced towards the parking lot.</span></p>
