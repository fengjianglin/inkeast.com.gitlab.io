 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 45: Xiaomei's Brother</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After Lu Xiaoqiang left, Jiang Zhengkai sat there and let out a long sigh of relief. &nbsp;It was a small world after all. &nbsp;The rookie Lu Xiaoqiang just happened to be the brother of the very first murder victim, Lu Xiaomei, aka A-Mei. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai sat there and thought for a while, but he eventually decided to consult the commander of the sub-bureau, Wu Jun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Wu Jun finished listening to Jiang Zhengkai’s explanation of the situation, he sat there and frowned, obviously anxious about the problem this presented. &nbsp;“Zhengkai, this Lu Xiaoqiang was hand-picked by Commissioner Yao.” &nbsp;Wu Jun paused to rub his hands together. &nbsp;“But from what you’ve just told me, he is indeed not the right choice to be your assistant right now. &nbsp;Damn, this really puts us in a bind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could we discuss this with Commissioner Yao, perhaps get Lu Xiaoqiang transferred to another department?” probed Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“I’m just afraid this is going to be too much of a blow to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Commissioner is at the provincial capital for a conference,” Wu Jun replied. &nbsp;“He arranged to have Lu Xiaoqiang sent here before he left, and he specifically told us to take good care of the rookie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But with the way things are now…” Jiang Zhengkai didn’t know how to continue. &nbsp;“Ai! &nbsp;He’s just a kid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not that young.” &nbsp;Wu Jun glanced at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“Besides, when you were his age, you were already a veteran cop.” &nbsp;He sighed. &nbsp;“How about this? &nbsp;You tell him the truth and see how he reacts. &nbsp;We’ll reassess based on his reaction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Commander. &nbsp;I understand,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded. &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang wouldn’t be the first police officer to experience a tragedy in the family, although his situation was more delicate than most. &nbsp;First of all, he was about to find out on his first day on the job that his sister was dead. &nbsp;Second, he was also going to find out that his sister had been supporting their family by being a prostitute. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai really didn’t know if Lu Xiaoqiang would be able to accept those facts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it was almost time to leave work, Lu Xiaoqiang hurried back to the sub-bureau from the municipal HQ. &nbsp;First he went back to his shared desk with Liu Na to organize the minutes he took of the meeting. &nbsp;He then excitedly brought the minutes to Jiang Zhengkai’s office. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, here are the meeting minutes I took.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’ve got really good handwriting, young man!” Jiang Zhengkai complemented Lu Xiaoqiang as he flipped through the minutes. &nbsp;“Hey, you got anything going on tonight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Lu Xiaoqiang straightforwardly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perfect!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai set down the meeting minutes on his desk and said, “Let’s go! &nbsp;I’m taking you out to dinner tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, I…” Lu Xiaoqiang originally thought Jiang Zhengkai was going to take him on an assignment. &nbsp;He hardly expected Jiang Zhengkai to take him out to dinner instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s with the hesitation? &nbsp;Come on, let’s get going!” Jiang Zhengkai said frankly as he patted Lu Xiaoqiang on the shoulder. &nbsp;“I don’t usually take people out to dinner. &nbsp;Hurry up before I change my mind!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm… let me buy you dinner instead!” Lu Xiaoqiang said somewhat uncomfortably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, you got any money?” Jiang Zhengkai laughed at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“Don’t worry about it. &nbsp;You can buy me dinner once you get your first paycheck.” &nbsp;He landed a hard punch squarely on Lu Xiaoqiang’s chest. &nbsp;“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” &nbsp;Even though Jiang Zhengkai’s punch almost caused Lu Xiaoqiang to tip over, he nevertheless felt like they had suddenly grown a lot closer. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Inspector Jiang... he’s really a good big brother! </span></i><span style>&nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang couldn’t help but feel that way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two men arrived at a small mom-and-pop restaurant. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai knew he would be drinking tonight, so he naturally didn’t drive. &nbsp;He picked a secluded table and then motioned for Lu Xiaoqiang to join him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you normally like to eat?” Jiang Zhengkai casually asked as he tossed the menu over to Lu Xiaoqiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m good with anything, Inspector Jiang,” Lu Xiaoqiang responded with a smile. &nbsp;“I’m not a picky eater.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! &nbsp;How about meat skewers and beer then?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai didn’t bother looking at the menu. &nbsp;He knew a small hole-in-the-wall joint like this specialized in home-cooked dishes and didn’t have anything fancy like sea cucumbers or abalone. &nbsp;“Give us ten meat skewers, shredded potatoes, and hot-and-sour soup. &nbsp;Oh, make sure to put plenty of hot chili powder on the meat skewers. &nbsp;And give each of us two pitchers of beer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, the waiter brought out Jiang Zhengkai’s meat skewers, side dishes, and beer. &nbsp;The two of them ate and made small talk for over half an hour. &nbsp;When Jiang Zhengkai saw that the pitchers were near empty, he called over the waiter and ordered another two pitchers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoqiang, why did you choose to become a police officer?” &nbsp;Even though Jiang Zhengkai was starting to slur his words, his mind was still quite clear. &nbsp;He poured another glass for Lu Xiaoqiang before filling up his glass as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, to tell you the truth, it’s because the police academy is tuition-free, and I even get a stipend,” Lu Xiaoqiang answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then your sister…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai raised his head and looked up Lu Xiaoqiang as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s expensive living in Beijing.” &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang lowered his head in embarrassment. &nbsp;“So I still need some help from her every month to make ends meet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of. &nbsp;Drink!” Jiang Zhengkai exhorted Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“Yeah, it’s not easy being family. &nbsp;It’s even harder being a cop’s family member.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean, Inspector? &nbsp;Did I… did I say something wrong?” Lu Xiaoqiang nervously asked when he saw Jiang Zhengkai’s expression had become more serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, don’t worry, it’s not anything you said,” Jiang Zhengkai downed his glass of beer and smiled at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“You know that being a cop, especially a detective or a narc, brings a certain amount of risk to one’s family members, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I understand,” Lu Xiaoqiang crisply replied. &nbsp;“Since I chose this profession, I’ve made mental preparations for the things that could happen.” &nbsp;However, as soon as he finished, his confidence waned a bit. &nbsp;After all, the lives of loved ones aren’t something to be taken lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good man! &nbsp;You’ve got strong conviction, just like me when I was your age!” Jiang Zhengkai chuckled at him. &nbsp;“Here, pour me another one.” &nbsp;Hearing Jiang Zhengkai’s order, Lu Xiaoqiang wasted no time in filling up his glass. &nbsp;“If your loved one died because of a case you were working on, you wouldn’t be sad?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai was obviously not drunk, as he began to verbally probe Lu Xiaoqiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I wouldn’t be,” Lu Xiaoqiang mechanically shook his head, but he knew in his heart that it was a lie. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai wasn’t fooled either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good,” Jiang Zhengkai said to the ceiling. &nbsp;“Having a loved one leave this world because of a case we’re working on is a very painful thing. &nbsp;It makes us regret forever some of the choices we’ve made. &nbsp;My wife, my daughter, five years ago…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai let the alcohol tear down his inhibitions and told Lu Xiaoqiang his personal tragedy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, I…” &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang felt very uneasy after hearing Jiang Zhengkai’s story. &nbsp;He didn’t know why Jiang Zhengkai wanted to tell him these things, but he clearly felt Jiang Zhengkai’s inner pain. &nbsp;Perhaps this was the first time he seriously thought about the pain the death of a loved one would bring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it’s not important anymore. &nbsp;It’s all in the past now.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai glanced at Lu Xiaoqiang and then raised his glass again. &nbsp;“Remember, if our loved ones died for us, they would want us to keep on living!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, Inspector Jiang.” &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang was originally thinking of things to say to comfort him, but it turned out that it was Jiang Zhengkai’s words that had comforted him. &nbsp;“You’re absolutely right! &nbsp;If I ever face a similar situation in the future, I’ll know what to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, that’s good,” Jiang Zhengkai smilingly replied as he looked at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“So, you said you have a sister in this city?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector.” &nbsp;When Lu Xiaoqiang heard Jiang Zhengkai mention his sister, he suddenly grew more energetic. &nbsp;After all, the previous conversation topic was a bit too heavy and depressing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, tell me about your sister then,” Jiang Zhengkai said as he laid back in his chair, obviously succumbing to the effects of alcohol intoxication. &nbsp;However, the young man sitting in front of him did not seem the least bit drunk. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Those Sichuanese can really hold their liquor, </span></i><span style>Jiang Zhengkai secretly complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai!” Lu Xiaoqiang sighed before he even began. &nbsp;“My father died when we were young, and my mom’s health has been pretty bad for a while. &nbsp;I’m the eldest in our family, and my sister Lu Xiaomei is number two. &nbsp;We also have a younger brother and a younger sister, so our family has always been poor. &nbsp;My sister wasn’t able to attend school. &nbsp;She grew up making money herding sheep or pulling weeds. &nbsp;A few years ago, she heard from friends from a neighboring village that she could make big bucks in the city, so she followed them here. &nbsp;From that time onwards, she never returned home, but she would wire back money every month.” &nbsp;At this point, Lu Xiaoqiang downed the remaining beer in his glass. &nbsp;“I know she worked hard for this money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right about that!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai’s body was swaying back and forth as he poured out another one for Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“Good to see that you’ve got a conscience and know how hard your sister has worked!” &nbsp;By now, his speech was becoming noticeably slurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, that’s why I asked to be assigned here after my graduation,” Lu Xiaoqiang smiled in response. &nbsp;“I must take care of my sister and help her support our family. &nbsp;In the future, when we’ve made enough money, I’m going to have our mother, little brother, and little sister all come live with us in the city. &nbsp;Then we’ll be one big happy family again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good man!” Jiang Zhengkai smiled back at him before falling back in his chair. &nbsp;He scrounged up a cigarette from his pocket and lit it. &nbsp;He was hoping the nicotine in his cigarette could help him sober up a bit. &nbsp;This Sichuanese boy could really drink!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Inspector Jiang, I have something to ask you. &nbsp;Do you know the address on the envelope?” Lu Xiaoqiang asked as he looked at Jiang Zhengkai with hope and expectation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai didn’t speak; he only nodded his head. &nbsp;He then breathed out a long plume of cigarette smoke. &nbsp;With the aid of the cigarette stimulating effect, he finally mustered the energy to say, “If I told you your sister had already passed, would you believe me?”</span></p>
