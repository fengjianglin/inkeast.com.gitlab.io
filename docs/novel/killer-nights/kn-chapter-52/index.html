 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 52: The Morning After</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai lay together on the bed. &nbsp;A-Jiao placed her head snugly on Jiang Zhengkai’s chest as she gently picked at his chest hairs. &nbsp;She closed her eyes slightly, obviously enjoying every moment of being together with her man. &nbsp;“Honey, do you want me?” A-Jiao murmured to Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Jiang Zhengkai obediently answered. &nbsp;A man’s desire for a woman was usually more intense than a woman’s desire for a man. &nbsp;As a normal man, Jiang Zhengkai was no different. &nbsp;He gently placed his hand on A-Jiao’s body and lightly rubbed up and down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tomorrow… Old Lady Wang won’t find out, will she?” A-Jiao quietly asked Jiang Zhengkai, “I still need to go in for my checkup tomorrow…” &nbsp;Even though those were the words that came out of her mouth, her hands thought differently as they reached towards Jiang Zhengkai’s lower body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… then let’s wait until tomorrow night then!” &nbsp;After hearing what A-Jiao had said, Jiang Zhengkai grabbed her hand and said, “Let’s just go to sleep tonight, or else Old Lady Wang might find out, and it won’t be a pretty sight if she does.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok!” A-Jiao agreed, “I can touch you though. &nbsp;You’re not the one going in for a checkup tomorrow.” &nbsp;As she spoke, A-Jiao freed her hand from Jiang Zhengkai’s grip and resumed touching Jiang Zhengkai’s genitals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, aren’t you afraid I might not be able to hold back?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai already had a hard time restraining himself in A-Jiao’s presence, but now that she was physically teasing him, it was almost impossible to suppress his carnal desires. &nbsp;The situation was completely different than when Jiang Zhengkai still believed A-Jiao to be Ren Ziyuan. &nbsp;Back then, being physically attracted to Ren Ziyuan meant betraying his love for A-Jiao. &nbsp;A man’s willpower was sufficient to keep external temptations at bay, which allowed him not do those things that would betray his principles. &nbsp;However, as those restrictions were stripped away, a man’s willpower was no stronger than that of a three-year-old child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao’s face grew beet red as she looked at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;Having been a prostitute, she could clearly tell from his touch that the man beside wanted her. &nbsp;A-Jiao was very torn about whether she should continue teasing Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;She knew this man didn’t think of her as unclean, and that was more than enough for her. &nbsp;However, she didn’t want to engage in foreplay without being able to finish him, since she could already feel his rock-hard erection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you… want me to suck on it?” a blushing A-Jiao quietly murmured as she looked at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Jiang Zhengkai crisply replied. &nbsp;A-Jiao now was no longer a prostitute, so he wouldn’t allow her to perform such services on him. &nbsp;Perhaps Japanese men enjoyed such services from their women, but as a normal Chinese man, Jiang Zhengkai could not accept his girlfriend engaging in such a practice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok,” A-Jiao responded as she pursed her lips. &nbsp;She then removed her hand from Jiang Zhengkai’s lower body. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai rolled onto A-Jiao and pinned her underneath his body as he proceeded to smother her with kisses. &nbsp;Afterwards, he got up and went to the bathroom where he took care of business by himself. &nbsp;A-Jiao did not protest at all. &nbsp;She calmly lay there and waited for Jiang Zhengkai to return. &nbsp;She knew that from this moment on, her body would belong only to Jiang Zhengkai!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, the two of them awoke from their slumbers. &nbsp;They fooled around in bed for a while before each of them got out of bed. &nbsp;A-Jiao now was every bit the happy housewife whenever she was in Jiang Zhengkai’s presence. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai’s every smile, every sweet word was enough to delight her for a long time. &nbsp;Perhaps now, A-Jiao finally understood why Cui Jing allowed herself to be lied to by that playboy Li Hongbin. &nbsp;It was because she loved him, so she willingly bought into his lies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey, breakfast is ready! &nbsp;Hurry over here and eat!” &nbsp;A-Jiao wore an apron and looked very much like a Filipina maid. &nbsp;She mischievously ran to the bathroom and stood next to Jiang Zhengkai as he was shaving. &nbsp;She then placed her hands behind her back and looked at him with the naughty eyes of a little girl as she asked, “Honey, can I shave you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm…” Jiang Zhengkai hesitated for a moment. &nbsp;He was holding in his hand an electric razor that he had bought at the neighborhood convenience store on his way to A-Jiao’s old house last night. &nbsp;Despite his misgivings, he handed the razor over to A-Jiao. &nbsp;He didn’t understand why A-Jiao wanted to help him shave. &nbsp;In fact, A-Jiao didn’t offer to shave Jiang Zhengkai because she liked to; rather, she offered purely out of curiosity. &nbsp;After all, hair never grew on her face, and human beings, especially females, are curious about things that they’ve never experienced before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao took the electric razor and painstakingly shaved Jiang Zhengkai’s face. &nbsp;Although she did this out of curiosity didn’t mean she didn’t take it seriously. &nbsp;She wanted to make Jiang Zhengkai look younger. &nbsp;She even thought about what he looked like when he was younger. &nbsp;After all, Jiang Zhengkai was half-again as old as A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok, I’m done! &nbsp;How is it? &nbsp;Just like a professional, right?” asked A-Jiao as she finished shaving Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;She stood there with razor in hand admiring his face the way she would admire a piece of art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad at all!” praised Jiang Zhengkai as he looked in the bathroom mirror, “My face is a lot smoother than when I do it myself!” &nbsp;Even though Jiang Zhengkai didn’t have that much experience with women, he nevertheless knew how to make a woman happy. &nbsp;He knew that a woman who had just fallen in love loved to hear her lover complimenting her. &nbsp;Wait, did that mean a married woman didn’t like hearing compliments? &nbsp;Or perhaps it was because a married woman had regained the ability to spot lies disguised as disingenuous compliments?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;I’ll shave you everyday then!” &nbsp;After she spoke, she felt a great sense of satisfaction as she handed the razor back to Jiang Zhengkai, “Now come out and eat your breakfast. &nbsp;Are you really coming with me to the hospital today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course! &nbsp;I’m a man of my word. &nbsp;If I say I’ll do something, I do it,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded, “Plus, today’s the weekend. &nbsp;I don’t have to be punctual when it’s overtime.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All you do is work! &nbsp;I’m surprised you even remember it’s the weekend!” &nbsp;Actually, if Jiang Zhengkai hadn’t mentioned it, A-Jiao would’ve been the one who totally forgot that it was the weekend. &nbsp;Her former profession, despite not being very glamorous, was still part of the “service” industry. &nbsp;As such, the weekends were the busiest times for prostitutes to offer their services.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright! &nbsp;Be a good girl. &nbsp;I promise I will spend all of my future weekends with you, but it’s just too busy right now,” said Jiang Zhengkai as he gave A-Jiao a back hug. &nbsp;His tone was like that of an adult trying to coax an upset child. &nbsp;It didn’t matter how old a woman was, they all liked being pampered and coaxed by their lovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then can I go with you to the office today?” A-Jiao turned around and asked Jiang Zhengkai with a look full of expectation. &nbsp;Since she had to go in for her checkup today, she obviously hadn’t scheduled a class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about this?” Jiang Zhengkai said somewhat embarrassingly. &nbsp;However, he quickly thought of something clever and then spoke to A-Jiao with a sly smile on his face, “You can come, but the only other people at the sub-bureau besides cops are witnesses and criminals. &nbsp;So which would you rather be today, a witness or a criminal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A witness!” A-Jiao blurted out. &nbsp;She realized as soon as the words left her mouth that she’d been had, so she complained, “You meanie! &nbsp;You tricked me again! &nbsp;What am I a witness to? &nbsp;I didn’t witness a crime!” &nbsp;She then proceeded to lightly hit Jiang Zhengkai’s body with her fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’re one smart cookie. &nbsp;You caught on before I even had the chance of pointing it out for you,” Jiang Zhengkai smiled at A-Jiao. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>She really is quite a smart woman!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai thought to himself. &nbsp;He had only opened the door a bit, and she immediately found out where he was going. &nbsp;But he did in fact have many questions to ask A-Jiao. &nbsp;After all, there were far too many leads from the serial murders that pointed to A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright! &nbsp;I’ll do it,” A-Jiao agreed as she put her head back on Jiang Zhengkai’s chest, “But only because you’re my boyfriend!” &nbsp;Afterwards, she raised her head to look at Jiang Zhengkai and added, “But I won’t sit in the back of your paddy wagon, and you have to feed me lunch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, don’t worry, we don’t make witnesses sit in the back,” Jiang Zhengkai chuckled as he replied, “But since you’re not being detained, I’m afraid we can’t serve you any of our mystery stew.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s so gross! &nbsp;Why don’t you go eat mystery stew for lunch?” &nbsp;Hearing what Jiang Zhengkai said, A-Jiao upped the tempo of her beatings. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai didn’t bother dodging. &nbsp;He allowed A-Jiao to have her way for a bit before grabbing her and locking her in a tight embrace. &nbsp;Being with this woman made him feel young, as if his life was full of vigor again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so annoying! &nbsp;And the breakfast I made for you is probably cold already!” A-Jiao complained, but she made no attempt to leave Jiang Zhengkai’s embrace. &nbsp;A few minutes later, she whispered while still in his arms, “Honey, let’s go eat our breakfast. &nbsp;I’m hungry.”</span></p>
