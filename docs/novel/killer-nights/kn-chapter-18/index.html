 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let’s eat!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai said, as the waiter brought over everything they had ordered. &nbsp;He began adjusting the hot pot’s temperature. “What did you want to eat first? &nbsp;Shrimp balls or sliced pork?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want the shrimp balls!” &nbsp;As the sight of the food on the table, A-Jiao’s mood immediately improved. &nbsp;After all, she had grown very tired of hospital food, so having something different for a change was a welcome delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Know anybody who’s still in touch with A-Xiu these days?” Jiang Zhengkai asked in a seemingly casual manner, as he picked up a cooked shrimp ball and placed it on A-Jiao’s plate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope. &nbsp;Yum! &nbsp;This is delicious!” A-Jiao replied matter-of-factly. “Turnover is very high in our line of work, so who knows where people go once they leave the alley.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how come you’ve stayed in that alley for two years?” asked Jiang Zhengkai with a smirk, before putting more pork in the pot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?” &nbsp;A-Jiao hesitated for a second before smiling. &nbsp;“Because I’m stupid. &nbsp;And broke. &nbsp;And I have to housesit for that former client of mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see,” Jiang Zhengkai acknowledged. &nbsp;However, he’d always thought there was something odd about that house. &nbsp;What kind of person would leave such a large, nicely furnished condo in the hands of a prostitute?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to know about what goes on in the alley, you’d be better off asking A-Shun or A-Tie,” A-Jiao continued as she shoved more food into her mouth. &nbsp;“They’ve been in that alley for years. &nbsp;Plus, all of the sisters working there give them protection money, so if something goes down in that alley, they’d definitely know about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, that makes sense,” Jiang Zhengkai responded while placing more food on A-Jiao’s plate. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>You’re definitely right about one thing, girl: A-Shun definitely knew something, and that’s why he told me to talk to you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you eating?” A-Jiao said, looking up at him. &nbsp;“Don’t you like hot pot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it’s not that. &nbsp;I do like hot pot,” Jiang Zhengkai chuckled. “But I didn’t order the things I like today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;Why?” A-Jiao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, really. &nbsp;Actually, I like spicy food, too,” Jiang Zhengkai replied before taking a sip of water. &nbsp;He still had to drive back tonight, so he hadn’t ordered any alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excellent!” &nbsp;A-Jiao clapped her hands. &nbsp;“Haha, serves you right! &nbsp;This’ll teach you to not let me eat what I want!” &nbsp;An expression of vindictive happiness was written all across her face. &nbsp;Even though the food on the table wasn’t exactly her favorite, that still didn’t affect her appetite. &nbsp;She ate a lot of food that night; so much food, in fact, that it felt as if there was literally no room left for anything else in her stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m so full!” A-Jiao boasted as she ate up the last bit of food on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go grab the check, and then we’re going back to the hospital, okay?” Jiang Zhengkai asked her with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sounds good, but I… need to use the restroom.” &nbsp;A-Jiao didn’t know when it started, but she was feeling a bit shy. &nbsp;Perhaps it had started with the “ten yuan per touch, you want your change” episode?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want me to go with you?” Jiang Zhengkai asked with a laugh. &nbsp;He knew it would be quite difficult for A-Jiao to walk the distance to the restaurant restroom all by herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” &nbsp;A-Jiao stretched out her arm towards him. &nbsp;Apparently, she rather enjoyed being carried by Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai very diligently carried her to the restroom entrance. &nbsp;This hot pot restaurant was fairly large in size, so it had two dedicated single-sex restrooms instead of one or two unisex restrooms like you would find in a smaller establishment. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not coming in with me?” A-Jiao asked with pouted lips as she found her footing on the floor beneath her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The police wouldn’t let me,” joked Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He had already gotten used to all of A-Jiao’s inappropriate questions and comments. &nbsp;In fact, he would’ve thought something was wrong with her if she didn’t say something inappropriate. &nbsp;“I’m going to go pay for our dinner. &nbsp;I’ll be right back. &nbsp;Don’t go wandering off after you’re done!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, got it!” replied A-Jiao. &nbsp;The two of them parted ways in front of the women’s restroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai paid for their meal at the counter and returned to the restroom entrance. &nbsp;He waited there for quite a while, but he didn’t see A-Jiao come out. &nbsp;None of the women who went in or out in the meantime seemed any different from normal. &nbsp;Therefore, even though Jiang Zhengkai felt a bit anxious, he didn’t think something out of the ordinary had happened in the restroom. &nbsp;After all, A-Jiao’s body was still recovering, so it made sense for her to be slower than normal. &nbsp;However, once half an hour had passed, he started to worry in earnest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a middle-aged female janitor happened to pass by with mop in hand. &nbsp;He immediately approached her and asked, “Ma’am, are you about to clean the restroom?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, but this is the women’s restroom!” the janitor answered with an incredulous look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes… I know,” Jiang Zhengkai smiled awkwardly. &nbsp;“I was thinking…” &nbsp;He paused for a second before continuing, “It’s like this, Ma’am: my girlfriend isn’t feeling well, and she’s been in there for a while. &nbsp;Could you do me a favor and see if she’s alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so that’s it.” &nbsp;The janitor smiled. &nbsp;“It looks like you care a lot about your woman, huh? &nbsp;Alright, young man, you wait here. &nbsp;I’ll go take a look.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But even as they were talking, there was a scream from the women’s restroom. &nbsp;As soon as he heard it, Jiang Zhengkai darted back towards the restroom door while unconsciously placing his hand on his gun holster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on in there?” he yelled at the women’s restroom door. &nbsp;He was a police officer, not a criminal, which meant he couldn’t just blatantly barge into the women’s restroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood! &nbsp;So much blood!” exclaimed a woman inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m coming in!” yelled Jiang Zhengkai as he charged into the women’s restroom. &nbsp;Indeed, a trail of dark blood streamed out of one of the restroom stalls. &nbsp;One woman was so nervous she had already backed into a corner. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai had instinctively drawn his gun. &nbsp;He raised his hand to block the female janitor from entering the restroom. &nbsp;“Ma’am, you got a key?” he asked her as he scanned all four corners of the restroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! &nbsp;H-here you go.” &nbsp;She handed him a key. &nbsp;“It’s… it’s the master key.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai took the key and motioned for her not to enter. &nbsp;He then slowly walked forward and gestured for the rest of the women to exit the restroom as well. &nbsp;He leaned against the door of the restroom stall the blood was flowing out of, while looking back towards the entrance. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Good; if there’s something behind this stall door, the only person it can hurt is me.</span></i><span style> &nbsp;He carefully slid the key into the lock and opened the stall door, where he found A-Jiao leaning against the wall and slumped to the ground. &nbsp;Blood continued to flow from her lower body. &nbsp;He nervously pointed his gun all around the restroom, but when he found no one else present, decided that there was no threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao! &nbsp;Quick, someone call an ambulance!” Jiang Zhengkai yelled at the restroom entrance. &nbsp;Seeing there was no immediate danger, he holstered his gun and lifted A-Jiao in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very quickly, an ambulance and a police cruiser converged on the front entrance of Hot Pot City. &nbsp;Apparently, one of the women in the restroom had already called the police. &nbsp;Seeing Jiang Zhengkai, who wasn’t in uniform, pulling out a loaded firearm was quite a traumatic experience for these average citizens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on here, Inspector Jiang?” asked the uniformed police officer who had arrived on-scene. &nbsp;As a local beat cop, he obviously recognized the district’s investigative task force commander.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing,” Jiang Zhengkai replied, standing next to A-Jiao’s stretcher. &nbsp;“She’s an important witness. &nbsp;I took her out to dinner hoping she could shed some light on a case I’m working on. &nbsp;She fainted in the restroom as we were about to leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And you drew your weapon?” the uniformed officer asked Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;She’s related to a string of recent homicides in this area,” Jiang Zhengkai replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, take care then, Inspector Jiang.” &nbsp;The uniformed officer finished his questioning and politely left Jiang Zhengkai’s side. &nbsp;Even though Jiang Zhengkai was present at the scene, the responding police officer still had to write an official report. &nbsp;After all, a firearm was brandished in his area of responsibility, so he had to explain clearly to his superiors exactly what had happened if he still wanted a career in the police force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Together with Jiang Zhengkai, A-Jiao was sent back to the hospital where she had been staying. &nbsp;Shortly after her arrival, her attending physician, Dr. Wang, hurried over and took her into surgery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai waited impatiently outside the operating room. &nbsp;A half hour later, Dr. Wang emerged from surgery. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai immediately got up and walked over to her. &nbsp;“How is she, Dr. Wang?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come to my office, Inspector Jiang,” responded Dr. Wang. &nbsp;Even though the expression on her face seemed somewhat strange, her tone of voice was calm and measured. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai suddenly felt a huge burden being lifted. &nbsp;He knew A-Jiao’s life was not in danger.</span></p>
