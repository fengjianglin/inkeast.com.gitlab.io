 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 50: Identity Revealed</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>On the storage rack were not only A-Jiao’s paintings, but also the paintings of her students. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai had not a shred of interest in what the children painted. &nbsp;He specifically went to where A-Jiao kept her paintings and very carefully looked through the collection. &nbsp;He finally found one that aroused his interest. &nbsp;“Ziyuan, what is this that you drew here? &nbsp;Is it some kind of a palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Palace?” asked A-Jiao as she turned around and looked at the painting that Jiang Zhengkai held. &nbsp;“Haha,that’s not a palace, you old bumpkin uncle! &nbsp;That’s the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery!” A-Jiao casually replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tashi Lhunpo Monastery? You’ve been to Tibet?” &nbsp;A-Jiao’s reply caused him to smile from ear&nbsp;</span><span style>to ear. &nbsp;The cat’s finally out of the bag, isn’t it? &nbsp;</span><i><span style>How dare you call me old bumpkin uncle? &nbsp;Why&nbsp;</span></i><i><span style>don’t you call me Uncle Policeman while you’re at it?</span></i><span style> &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai secretly thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” A-Jiao replied without thinking, “Just recently…” &nbsp;She suddenly realized she had misspoken, but it was already too late. &nbsp;“Just recently went there,” she finished saying as she pressed her brush hard against the canvas. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Damn it! &nbsp;I can’t believe I let that slip! &nbsp;That crafty Uncle Policeman! &nbsp;And he had the audacity to entrap me right here in my own art studio! </span></i><span style>&nbsp;She&nbsp;</span><span style>secretly thought to herself. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;A-Jiao was there not so long ago either,” Jiang Zhengkai casually replied to A-Jiao’s statement. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>I want to see how long you plan on keeping up this charade!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” asked A-Jiao. &nbsp;She then hid her brush behind her back and quietly walked over to Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“Did she visit Shigatse as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shigatse?” Jiang Zhengkai raised his head and asked A-Jiao. &nbsp;He truly did not know that the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery was in Shigatse. &nbsp;It’s not like he had studied Buddhist theology or history of religion at the police academy. &nbsp;He was a cop, not a walking encyclopedia, so let’s cut him some slack, shall we?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t know that, did you?” A-Jiao remarked. &nbsp;Her hand then moved with lightning speed, and before Jiang Zhengkai realized what had happened, she had already drawn a thick line on his&nbsp;</span><span style>face. &nbsp;She then immediately turned and ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddamn it, girl! &nbsp;What are you doing?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai dropped the painting in his hand and quickly chased after A-Jiao. &nbsp;Even though the art studio was sizeable, but it was still A-Jiao’s workplace. &nbsp;As such, she couldn’t act too crazy in here, so she was caught by Jiang Zhengkai in almost no time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t do it again, Brother Jiang!” A-Jiao pleaded, “I’m begging you! &nbsp;I promise I won’t do it again! &nbsp;Let me go, please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let you go? &nbsp;Fine!” &nbsp;Despite what he said, Jiang Zhengkai did not relax his grip, “I’ll let&nbsp;</span><span style>you go as soon as you let me draw on your face!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You suck, meanie! &nbsp;I’m a girl! &nbsp;You’re supposed to take it easy on me!” A-Jiao said in response as she stiffened her upper lip to show her displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? &nbsp;But A-Jiao once told me to never be taken advantage of by a woman!” Jiang Zhengkai laughingly said to the still-restrained A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God, I hate your A-Jiao so much!” &nbsp;Even though that is what her mouth said, her face, on the other hand, was full of smiles. &nbsp;“Fine, I’ll let you draw on my face!” said A-Jiao as she&nbsp;</span><span style>struggled to free her arms, but Jiang Zhengkai wasn’t having any of it. &nbsp;The two of them struggled for a while before they found themselves pressed up against the blackboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I surrender! &nbsp;Let me go! &nbsp;You’re hurting me!” cried A-Jiao as she was pinned against the&nbsp;</span><span style>blackboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok, fine!” &nbsp;When Jiang Zhengkai heard A-Jiao complaining about being hurt, he immediately released her. &nbsp;Apparently this trick worked against Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He still remembered how badly their last rough play at the hospital had ended, so he didn’t want to accidentally hurt her again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” &nbsp;As soon as Jiang Zhengkai let her go, A-Jiao used her brush to draw another line on Jiang Zhengkai’s face, “Gotcha! &nbsp;Haha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai didn’t know what to do about that unruly girl in front of him. &nbsp;However, he was determined to wrest control of the brush away from her. &nbsp;Just at that moment, A-Jiao’s foot slipped, and her body fell towards the blackboard. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the silly girl’s head plopped straight into the blackboard eraser, and her face came into contact with a large cloud of chalk dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoa there!” Jiang Zhengkai shouted as he raced to catch her body. &nbsp;Luckily for A-Jiao, Jiang Zhengkai was able to reach her in time, which meant she didn’t fall flat on the floor. &nbsp;However, the blackboard eraser landed squarely on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, are you going to behave yourself?” teased Jiang Zhengkai as he lifted up her body. &nbsp;He looked at A-Jiao’s chalk dust-covered face and joyfully proclaimed, “Karma’s a bitch, isn't it?&nbsp; Even the blackboard had it in for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh! &nbsp;You’re so annoying! &nbsp;And I can’t see!” said A-Jiao as she started to rub her eyes. &nbsp;Clearly, she had chalk dust in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t rub your eyes! &nbsp;Let me blow the dust off your face first,” warned Jiang Zhengkai as he grabbed her arm. &nbsp;He was worried that the chalk dust might scratch her corneas if she kept rubbing her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No thank you!” &nbsp;A-Jiao’s face grew bright red as she spoke. &nbsp;She knew there was no way for her to escape Jiang Zhengkai’s clutches. &nbsp;He had grabbed both her arms and pinned them behind her back. &nbsp;A-Jiao saw Jiang Zhengkai’s face nearing hers, so she had to close her eyes. &nbsp;She wasn’t afraid that Jiang Zhengkai might blow more dust into her eyes, but she was afraid he might find out the secret to her changing eye color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry! &nbsp;I’ll be very careful,” Jiang Zhengkai said to A-Jiao in a very gentle voice. &nbsp;This was the perfect opportunity to observe A-Jiao’s eyes up close, and he was not going to let it go to waste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok…” &nbsp;Although A-Jiao didn’t want to, she had no choice but to open her eyes because it was pretty painful to have chalk dust in her eyes. &nbsp;Seeing that A-Jiao was no longer resisting, he relaxed his grip on her arms and let her move closer to him herself. &nbsp;He gently blew the foreign particles out of A-Jiao’s eyes, but it was then that he discovered A-Jiao’s contact lenses, which had shifted from their normal location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this?” Jiang Zhengkai looked at A-Jiao’s eyes and softly asked, “Do you have something else in your eyes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so annoying! &nbsp;Haven’t you ever seen a girl wearing contacts before?” said A-Jiao as she stiffened her body, “I’m going to the restroom. &nbsp;You wait for me here! &nbsp;On second thought, you should go, too, and wash all that paint off of your face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time they came out of the restroom, A-Jiao’s eyes returned to their normal black color. &nbsp;Because foreign particles like dust easily clung to contact lenses, A-Jiao could no longer wear them comfortably in her eyes. &nbsp;As soon as the two of them returned to the art studio, Jiang Zhengkai immediately closed the door behind them. &nbsp;He again grabbed A-Jiao and pulled her into his embrace. &nbsp;He then stared at A-Jiao’s face and asked, “Let me take a look at your eyes. &nbsp;Do they still hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go away! &nbsp;I don’t want you to look!” A-Jiao exclaimed as she lowered her head slightly. &nbsp;She pursed her lips and said to Jiang Zhengkai, “You’re so annoying! &nbsp;You’re an annoying Uncle Policeman!” &nbsp;As she spoke, she placed her head on Jiang Zhengkai’s chest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai gently stopped her and softly stroked her hair. &nbsp;He then whispered in her ear, “You little liar! &nbsp;I should have your arrested!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… then are you going to feed me everyday?” &nbsp;A-Jiao’s face grew beet red while pressed up against Jiang Zhengkai’s chest. &nbsp;“I… I didn’t lie to you! &nbsp;My real name is Ren Ziyuan! &nbsp;Brother Jiang… Uncle Policeman… please don’t get at me! &nbsp;Please don’t leave me!” &nbsp;A-Jiao’s voice began to tremble mid-sentence as she struggled to choke back tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You silly girl!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai held A-Jiao tight as he gently kissed her cheek, “Why would I leave you? &nbsp;But you need to behave yourself from now on. &nbsp;You can’t run away again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all your fault! &nbsp;You’re the one that stopped talking to me!” said A-Jiao as she buried her face even deeper into Jiang Zhengkai’s chest. &nbsp;She then tapped Jiang Zhengkai’s chest with her fists while complaining softly, “I know… you were ashamed of me because I was a prostitute…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I wasn’t. &nbsp;I promise!” Jiang Zhengkai answered as he held her. &nbsp;Actually, he understood what A-Jiao said wasn’t completely without merit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You might not be now, but you definitely were!” &nbsp;A-Jiao pursed her lips and raised her head towards Jiang Zhengkai, “Brother Jiang, are you mad at me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai looked into eyes, smiled, and shook his head. &nbsp;He understood where A-Jiao was coming from, even though it resulted in creating quite a bit of heartache for him. &nbsp;Still, it didn’t matter anymore. &nbsp;A-Jiao had returned to his side, and she now had a respectable job. &nbsp;Wasn’t that all a man really wanted from his woman?</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao saw Jiang Zhengkai wasn’t going to blame her, so she placed her head up against Jiang Zhengkai’s chest again and quietly muttered, “Brother Jiang, I love you…”</span></p>
