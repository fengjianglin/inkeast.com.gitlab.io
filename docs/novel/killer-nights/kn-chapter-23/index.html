 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 23: The Surgeon's Secret</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai took note of where the pharmacy was, and then opened a hallway window. &nbsp;He found that right across from the pharmacy was a large tree that offered the perfect vantage point through a window. &nbsp;“Come on, let’s move outside!” he said as he jumped out of the hallway window. &nbsp;Seeing her boss jump out, Wei Xin quickly followed suit. &nbsp;Thanks to Hippocrates, the hospital’s emergency room wing was located on the first floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon thereafter, Jiang Zhengkai and Wei Xin both climbed up the tree. &nbsp;The treetop offered excellent line of sight to the pharmacy window, through which they could clearly see everything that went on inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yu Di and that female nurse were making out on one of the pharmacy tables. &nbsp;Even though there was a partition curtain in the middle of the pharmacy, it was not fully extended, so from his position, Jiang Zhengkai could clearly see their movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Di and the nurse were kissing and teasing one another, and before long were undoing each other’s buttons. &nbsp;The nurse wrapped her legs around Yu Di’s waist, while he continued kissing her face and body. &nbsp;She kicked off her shoes, and they fell to the floor, revealing a pair of legs clad in white pantyhose. &nbsp;Her legs then started writhing at random, while she made a series of low moans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the window, Wei Xin had already looked away, turning to face Jiang Zhengkai instead. &nbsp;Although Wei Xin was very tempted by what she saw inside the pharmacy, she was completely devoid of experience in such matters. &nbsp;She had no idea how to control her emotions when faced with such a situation. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai stood on a tree branch right next to Wei Xin. &nbsp;His expression seemed very calm, as if what he saw wasn’t a man and a woman engaged in passionate lovemaking, but just something that was entirely mundane and uninteresting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon thereafter, a soft “slurping” noise started emanating from inside the room. &nbsp;This sound caused Wei Xin’s attention to shift to the window once again. &nbsp;The curtain blocked Yu Di’s exact movements, but Wei Xin could make out that he was lying on top of the nurse’s body, although she didn’t know what exactly Yu Di was doing. &nbsp;However, Jiang Zhengkai knew that Yu Di was using his tongue to do something that most men were not particularly fond of doing. &nbsp;That </span><i><span style>slurp slurp</span></i><span style> noise, followed by the woman’s </span><i><span style>uhns </span></i><span style>and </span><i><span style>ahs, </span></i><span style>clearly proved him correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you inside of me right now! &nbsp;Uhn! &nbsp;Uhn…” the woman started begging, followed by soft moans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can stop looking now. &nbsp;It’s just two people having sex,” Jiang Zhengkai said to Wei Xin as he slapped her on the shoulder. &nbsp;Wei Xin was completely transfixed by what was going on inside the pharmacy. &nbsp;When she finally realized Jiang Zhengkai had called to her, her face turned a bright red as she quickly looked away from the window. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai saw her expression and thought it was hilarious, so he said to her softly, “If you find it so interesting, we could stick around a little bit longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!” Wei Xin quickly agreed, before she realized he was teasing her, at which point her face grew even redder. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang… you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, time to return to the hallway!” ordered Jiang Zhengkai as he carefully leapt down from the tree and climbed through the window back into the hospital’s hallway. &nbsp;Wei Xin, on the other hand, took another look through the window as she descended the tree. &nbsp;By now, Yu Di’s body and the nurse’s body had become one. &nbsp;Apparently, sexual desire was an urge that’s shared by all human beings, regardless of gender or occupation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on, let’s go back to the surgery wing,” Jiang Zhengkai quietly said to Wei Xin as she returned inside. &nbsp;He started walking in the direction of the surgery call room. &nbsp;It appeared that Yin Zhumei wasn’t Yu Di’s only lover in this hospital. &nbsp;Then again, Yu Di’s oral sex skills probably made him quite popular with the ladies, so it made sense that he would have multiple lovers. &nbsp;After all, most Chinese men weren’t all that fond of oral, which made Yu Di a bit of an outlier. &nbsp;Perhaps having a Japanese man for a husband isn’t such a bad idea after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After half an hour, they could once again hear the sound of footsteps coming from the hallway. &nbsp;When the footsteps stopped in front the surgery call room, the sound of a man and a woman flirting came from the other side of the door. &nbsp;A moment later, the footsteps picked up again, but this time, it was just one person gradually walking away. &nbsp;Seconds later, the door to the call room opened and Yu Di walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… who are you?” Yu Di asked with a start, terror-stricken when he saw Jiang Zhengkai and Wei Xin. &nbsp;“W-what are you doing here?” &nbsp;Clearly, he was surprised by the presence of these two strangers in the surgery call room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, why do you think, Doctor?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at the way Yu Di acted now; the confidence which he’d displayed when he flirted with that nurse had now completely abandoned him. &nbsp;“Obviously we’re here to seek medical attention. &nbsp;Why else would we be here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! &nbsp;Well, umm, it’s the middle of the night, and when I came in here, I saw two people I’d never seen before, so…” &nbsp;Having heard Jiang Zhengkai explain himself, Yu Di calmed down somewhat. &nbsp;“Well anyway, you scared me half to death,” Yu Di said as he picked up Jiang Zhengkai’s medical record. &nbsp;“So, what are you here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anxiety,” Jiang Zhengkai said with a smile, staring intently at Yu Di the whole time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anxiety?” &nbsp;Yu Di looked momentarily dumbstruck by what he’d just heard, before focusing his attention back on Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“Excuse me, but this is the surgery wing, not the psychology wing.” &nbsp;His hand that was holding the medical records was visibly shaking as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doctor, actually, I’m a physician as well: a psychologist, to be exact,” Jiang Zhengkai replied as he inched closer towards Yu Di.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… who the hell are you?” &nbsp;Yu Di’s body reacted like he had just been stabbed. &nbsp;He stepped back from Jiang Zhengkai and leaned up against the wall as his head started shaking ever so slightly. &nbsp;It appeared that this man was having a full-blown nervous breakdown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m here to treat you, Dr. Yu.” &nbsp;As Jiang Zhengkai spoke, his body leaned forward onto the chair while his fingers tapped rhythmically on Yu Di’s desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, get out!” &nbsp;Yu Di had completely lost his nerves. &nbsp;He pointed one of his shaking hands at the call room door while using the other to prop himself up. &nbsp;“If you don’t get out, I’m going to call the police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;Well, in that case, I’ll save you the trouble.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai leaned up against Yu Di’s desk and smiled. &nbsp;“We are the police.” &nbsp;He proceeded to flash his police badge at Yu Di.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh… Comrade Police Officer…” &nbsp;Seeing Jiang Zhengkai’s police badge, Yu Di lost all semblance of physical control. &nbsp;His legs gave way, and he plopped down into his chair. &nbsp;“I… I didn’t kill A-Mei! &nbsp;I swear! &nbsp;I didn’t do it! &nbsp;I loved her!” he pleaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai stared into Yu Di’s eyes, yet for some reason, it was A-Jiao’s voice ringing in his ears. &nbsp;“</span><i><span style>You love anything with a pair of legs, don’t you? &nbsp;I wonder if you’re into something with three legs too.</span></i><span style>” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai chuckled to himself as he remained focused on Yu Di. &nbsp;“Dr. Yu, how did you know we had evidence implicating you in Yin Zhumei’s murder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lies! &nbsp;You’re trying to frame me!” &nbsp;Yu Di fell back into his chair while yelling hysterically at the top of his lungs, “Lies! &nbsp;All lies!” &nbsp;His body started convulsing uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dr. Yu, take some time to think it over, okay? &nbsp;It looks like you’re a bit stressed out right now, so I’ll come back in a few days and chat with you some more,” Jiang Zhengkai teased as he stood up to leave. &nbsp;Suddenly, A-Jiao’s voice once again spoke in his ear. &nbsp;“</span><i><span style>That’s right! &nbsp;How did they let this retard become a surgeon? &nbsp;Is he here to save people or kill them?</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai signaled to Wei Xin, and the two of them headed for the door in unison. &nbsp;As he reached the door, Jiang Zhengkai smiled, turned around, and added, “Dr. Yu, I suggest you take some nutritional supplements. &nbsp;Working late nights at the pharmacy takes a toll on the body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them soon returned to the parking lot. &nbsp;“Come on, let’s go. &nbsp;I’ll give you a ride home,” Jiang Zhengkai said to Wei Xin as they reached his car. &nbsp;“Yu Di isn’t the killer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!” Wei Xin answered. &nbsp;She seemed a bit off. &nbsp;It looked like Yu Di’s sexual escapades had really affected her mood tonight. &nbsp;After all, she wasn’t A-Jiao, so she wasn’t used to seeing those kinds of things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, snap out of it! &nbsp;Can you go back home by yourself?” Jiang Zhengkai asked as he parked the car next to the police barracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector Jiang,” Wei Xin smiled at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;It appeared that her spirit had recovered considerably. &nbsp;“So how do you know Yu Di isn’t the killer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Instinct,” replied Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He recalled Yu Di’s bearing, or lack thereof, and added, “He has neither the physique nor the ruthlessness required of a killer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;Alright, Inspector Jiang, I’ll see you tomorrow. &nbsp;Don’t go to bed too late!” Wei Xin gently reminded him as she got out of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See you later. &nbsp;Rest well.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai waved at her to go to her dorm room. &nbsp;He then drove away from the police barracks, but he didn’t head straight home. &nbsp;Instead, he parked his car outside the gates of Ju’an Estates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai sat in his car and lit a cigarette. &nbsp;He silently gazed at A-Jiao’s window. &nbsp;He hoped with all his heart that the lights in that condo would suddenly turn on, or that A-Jiao would happen to appear at the window. &nbsp;Nevertheless, deep down inside, he also knew that the miracle he so desperately wished for would ultimately not come to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long after Jiang Zhengkai and Wei Xin had left, Yu Di was still convulsing uncontrollably in his chair. &nbsp;He felt like his days were numbered, and that his next stop would be the gallows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The following morning, he turned himself in at the local police station. &nbsp;He confessed to all of his crimes, including adultery and sexual assault of female patients. &nbsp;Everyone has a weakness, and Yu Di was far from the only person in this world to let his weakness lead to his downfall.</span></p>
