 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Killer Nights</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 74: A-Xiu's Not Dead?</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Jiang Zhengkai believed that what he’d seen the night of A-Xiu’s death had been a figment of his imagination, he nevertheless told Zhang Nan in vivid detail everything he thought he’d seen that night. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Zhang Nan had finished listening to Jiang Zhengkai’s story, he too furrowed his brow. &nbsp;He knew Jiang Zhengkai was a careful and prudent person, so it was very unlikely that he would make up this type of story. &nbsp;In addition, as a veteran cop with over a dozen years of experience on the police force, Jiang Zhengkai had seen at least a hundred dead bodies, if not more, so it didn’t make sense for him to be scared out of his mind just by the sight of a human skeleton. &nbsp;Therefore, he had no plausible reason to rebut Jiang Zhengkai’s statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, Sergeant Zhang, the interrogation room is ready,” said Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;He and Guo Wei stood in front of Zhang Nan’s office, awaiting further instructions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go ahead and question A-Shun then,” said Jiang Zhengkai as he glanced back at Zhang Nan. &nbsp;The two of them shared a knowing look. &nbsp;“How about this? &nbsp;Xiaoqiang, you and Guo Wei will be responsible for escorting A-Shun. &nbsp;Sergeant Zhang and I will handle the interrogation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five minutes later, A-Shun was escorted into the interrogation room. &nbsp;Even though A-Shun had not been mistreated in the least during his stay at the station, his expression was far from normal. &nbsp;His heart was full of regret, especially from having told Jiang Zhengkai that A-Ju had died. &nbsp;Sometimes, people are just that stupid. &nbsp;He could have given the police the usual BS about how A-Ju was scared or whatever, and that she’d decided to leave the alley or the city altogether. &nbsp;Instead, he straight up admitted that A-Ju had died of a drug overdose. &nbsp;The government might be able to monitor the movements of people engaged in honest work, but prostitutes were an obvious exception. &nbsp;If he’d just claimed that A-Ju had left, they’d have no way to prove otherwise. &nbsp;So why did he have to admit that A-Ju had died? &nbsp;Right now, A-Shun’s mind was full of self-blame. &nbsp;Not for A-Ju’s death, of course; rather, he blamed himself for saying the wrong thing and getting himself in trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Shun, A-Ju’s autopsy report is out,” Jiang Zhengkai said expressionlessly as A-Shun sat down. &nbsp;“She died of a drug overdose. &nbsp;Her body did not exhibit any external injuries, so we do not suspect you to be involved in her death.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Plump!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;At the sound of those last few words, A-Shun immediately fell out of his chair and onto his knees. &nbsp;He didn’t think that Jiang Zhengkai would give him such good news as soon as he walked in. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Haha, I didn’t kill A-Ju! &nbsp;I’m innocent! &nbsp;Haha!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;A-Shun’s heart boiled with jubilation, but he had to outwardly display his gratitude. &nbsp;“Thank… I thank you, Inspector Jiang! &nbsp;I thank the people’s government! &nbsp;Thank you, Inspector Jiang! &nbsp;I have a wife and child! &nbsp;I’m not a murderer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! &nbsp;Alright!” &nbsp;Zhang Nan waved his hand in annoyance at A-Shun’s repeated pleadings. &nbsp;“Just because you didn’t kill A-Ju doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. &nbsp;Why did you conceal her body? &nbsp;Concealing a body is also illegal!” &nbsp;Due to China’s population density and the possibility of spreading illnesses, the central government has repeatedly ordered its citizens to cremate the remains of the deceased prior to burial. &nbsp;However, A-Shun had blatantly disregarded the government’s laws, so he was a criminal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I was wrong! &nbsp;I know I messed up.” &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang and Guo Wei had pulled A-Shun back into the chair. &nbsp;He trembled slightly as he sat there and continuously apologized. &nbsp;“Sergeant Zhang, I messed up. &nbsp;I promise not to do it again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then let me ask you this,” said Jiang Zhengkai, producing a piece of cardboard from the table. &nbsp;Things were already going well; informing A-Shun that he was cleared of any suspicion of murder had clearly made him much more willing to talk. &nbsp;If he’d clammed up, the interrogation would’ve been a lot more difficult. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai pointed at the portrait pinned to the cardboard. &nbsp;“Do you recognize this woman?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Sha!” A-Shun crisply answered as he glanced at the portrait. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Wasn’t she locked up here as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good! &nbsp;How about this one?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he pulled out another portrait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaomei!” A-Shun crisply answered once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And her?” Jiang Zhengkai continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Xiu!” A-Shun once again answered without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?” repeated Jiang Zhengkai as he held up the portrait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I’m sure. &nbsp;It’s her!” &nbsp;Hearing Jiang Zhengkai repeat his question, A-Shun leaned in and got a closer look at the portrait. &nbsp;He then resolutely replied, “I’m positive. &nbsp;That is definitely A-Xiu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he put down the portrait. &nbsp;His eyes were like hooks as he stared into A-Shun. &nbsp;“Then why did I see her somewhere else after A-Xiu had supposedly died?” &nbsp;Naturally, Jiang Zhengkai wouldn’t tell A-Shun that the A-Xiu he’d seen had been an emaciated body with just skin and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You saw her?” A-Shun asked with obvious surprise. &nbsp;He blinked his eyes and thought for a while before muttering to himself, “So there really are ghosts?” &nbsp;He then looked at Jiang Zhengkai again and asked, “Inspector, you’re not playing with me, are you? &nbsp;Are you sure that’s what you saw?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this some kind of a joke to you?” &nbsp;Zhang Nan demanded. &nbsp;He slammed his hand down onto the table and yelled, “Tell us what we want to know now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes! &nbsp;Of course!” A-Shun nodded nervously in response to Zhang Nan’s verbal thrashing. &nbsp;He knew the government had a policy of being lenient with those who cooperated and harsh to those who did not. &nbsp;Of course, the government’s definition of harshness didn’t include beatings. &nbsp;After all, the Chinese government respects human rights. &nbsp;Though, only those who’ve been on the receiving end of the criminal justice system can tell you if that’s truly the case or not…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell us what is really going on here,” said Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He looked at A-Shun as he leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well…” &nbsp;A-Shun lowered his head and swayed left and right. &nbsp;He was obviously searching for the right words to say. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>How was I supposed to know what happened if even the cops don’t know? &nbsp;But if the cops say I know, then I’ve got no other choice than to say that I do know.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Spit it out!” &nbsp;Zhang Nan realized that it could take a while before A-Shun finally found the words he was looking for, so he simply went ahead and yelled at him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, Sergeant… Sergeant Zhang!” said A-Shun in a shaky voice as he raised his head. &nbsp;“When A-Xiu died, I was at home taking care of my sick kid. &nbsp;Plus, I’d only met her a few times. &nbsp;The one who handled all of her business was A-Tie!” &nbsp;A-Shun paused for a moment and wiped the sweat from his brow. &nbsp;“That woman who died… &nbsp;She was A-Xiu, or at least that’s what we called her.” &nbsp;At this point, A-Shun’s tone became somewhat unsure. &nbsp;“She looked just like A-Xiu, after all. &nbsp;So when she came back, we all joked around and said, ‘Hey, Xiu, how come you’re back? &nbsp;Life on the outside isn’t so easy after all, is it?’ &nbsp;I think she just smiled in response and didn’t actually say anything. &nbsp;Since my kid was sick, I told A-Tie to arrange a room for her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what you’re saying is that the woman didn’t actually identify herself?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he straightened his body. &nbsp;If that were true, then could it be that the emaciated woman he saw upstairs that night was the real A-Xiu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me think… I don’t think she did!” said A-Shun as he shook his head. &nbsp;Even though he still didn’t sound too sure, he nevertheless repeated himself. &nbsp;“She didn’t actually say she was A-Xiu! &nbsp;I just assumed she was.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh-huh!” &nbsp;After hearing A-Shun talk, Jiang Zhengkai let out a deep breath through his nose. &nbsp;It looks like this pimp provided inaccurate information when he was first interviewed regarding A-Xiu’s death. &nbsp;He cocked his head and exchanged another look with Zhang Nan. &nbsp;The expression in Zhang Nan’s eyes was one of sincere apology. &nbsp;After all, he was the one who’d told Jiang Zhengkai that the murder victim was A-Xiu, and the source of that information was none other than the same A-Shun sitting here today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have some other way to confirm A-Xiu’s identity?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he shifted his attention back to A-Shun. &nbsp;“A birthmark, or some other identifying body feature?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm…” &nbsp;A-Shun thought for a bit, then shook his head. &nbsp;Even though A-Shun was a pimp, he wasn’t actually all that interested in the women he sold for money. &nbsp;He loved his wife and child, so he had no need to create drama for himself by “sampling the wares” at work. &nbsp;Of course, he did occasionally have that thought, but his sense of reason always got the better of him. &nbsp;Plus, the alley wasn’t the only prostitution hub in the city. &nbsp;If he really wanted to, he could simply pay for a prostitute in some other part of town. &nbsp;As such, there was no reason for him to get sexually involved with the women in his employ.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, he can go!” announced Jiang Zhengkai as he looked at A-Shun and waved his hand at Lu Xiaoqiang and Guo Wei. &nbsp;“Bring A-Sha in on your way back.” &nbsp;According to A-Sha’s two statements, and judging by A-Shun’s expression, Jiang Zhengkai believed A-Shun didn’t have any more ideas on how to confirm A-Xiu’s identity.</span></p>
