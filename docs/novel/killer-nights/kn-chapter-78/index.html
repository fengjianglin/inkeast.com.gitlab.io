 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 78: Viewing a Corpse on a Rainy Day</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It continued to rain as Jiang Zhengkai and A-Jiao left Uncle Cai’s noodle shop. &nbsp;A-Jiao handed her umbrella over to Jiang Zhengkai and then placed her head on his shoulder. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Jiang Zhengkai held her in his embrace before the two walked out hugging one another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey, can we not go home yet?” A-Jiao asked softly as she cuddled in Jiang Zhengkai’s embrace. &nbsp;“You said I could come with you to take a look at Sister Xiu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Today?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai stopped dead in his tracks as he heard A-Jiao’s request. &nbsp;“But it’s raining today,” he said as he looked at A-Jiao uncertainly. &nbsp;His point was clear: </span><i><span style>aren’t you scared to visit the police morgue on such a stormy evening?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I please go?” begged A-Jiao. &nbsp;“I miss her. &nbsp;I just want to see her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, fine,” acquiesced Jiang Zhengkai when he saw the look on A-Jiao’s face. &nbsp;No man would be able to resist the woman he loved if she wore such an expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like that, amidst wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, Jiang Zhengkai and A-Jiao arrived at the police sub-bureau. &nbsp;They walked to the morgue and stood in front of the entrance. &nbsp;The morgue guards let them in without a second thought when they saw Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He very easily found the label for A-Xiu’s remains and proceeded to pull her skeletal corpse out of the freezer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao stood to the side and silently looked on as Jiang Zhengkai went about retrieving the body. &nbsp;Tears streamed continuously down her cheek. &nbsp;Was this skeleton resting on this freezing slab really the same woman who had once saved her life? &nbsp;Was this the really the big sister who had loved and cared for her? &nbsp;As she dwelled on such things, A-Jiao’s tears flew down from her face like unchained pearls from a broken necklace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, here she is,” said Jiang Zhengkai as he pulled back the sheet that was covering A-Xiu’s body. &nbsp;He then stood next to A-Jiao and gently held her. &nbsp;He knew that in this moment of pain, A-Jiao needed his help and support. &nbsp;She gently leaned her body into him as they slowly trod towards A-Xiu’s corpse, her legs feeling like they had turned to lead. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey, can I touch her?” A-Jiao asked in a grief-stricken voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure you can,” Jiang Zhengkai said as he carefully supported her. &nbsp;He would probably agree to any request A-Jiao had, short of wanting to remove A-Xiu’s body from the morgue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing his reply, A-Jiao let out a deep sigh. &nbsp;She then wiped away her tears and briefly stopped sobbing. &nbsp;She reached out her hand and touched the skin covering A-Xiu’s skeletal face. &nbsp;A-Xiu’s skin had already detached from her skull, so her face really wasn’t a face anymore, even if the skin still covered the bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao’s hand rubbed A-Xiu’s facial regions for a while as she affectionately gazed at the skeleton on the morgue bed. &nbsp;What she did next, however, caused a slight bit of alarm in Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;A-Jiao’s hand followed the contours of A-Xiu’s skeletal body and moved downwards as she gradually pushed the sheet covering A-Xiu’s body onto the floor. &nbsp;With the removal of the sheet, A-Xiu’s naked body-skeleton was completely exposed. &nbsp;As A-Jiao’s hand moved further down A-Xiu’s body, her sobs gradually stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the morgue, torrential rains continued their downpour as thunder cracked loudly overhead and lightning streaked down from the sky. &nbsp;At that very moment, the scene in the morgue would send terror into even the bravest souls. &nbsp;As another streak of lightning lit up the sky, A-Jiao turned around and looked expressionlessly at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;Her normally beautiful face appeared ghostly pale under the lightning’s glare. &nbsp;If it weren’t for the fact that he knew this was the woman he loved, Jiang Zhengkai would be inclined to believe he was face to face with some sort of she-demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not Sister Xiu!” came the sound from A-Jiao’s mouth as she moved her lips. &nbsp;It was a very quiet sound, but to Jiang Zhengkai’s ears, it might as well have had the force of one of the myriad thunderclaps that shook the night sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not A-Xiu?” asked Jiang Zhengkai, as the hand that was supporting A-Jiao suddenly grew stiff. &nbsp;Even though the interrogation session earlier in the day had made him doubt whether these skeletal remains really were A-Xiu, hearing A-Jiao actually say such words out loud here on this rainy night still made the hairs on the back of his neck crawl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it’s not Sister Xiu!” repeated A-Jiao. &nbsp;She then leaned closely into Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“Honey, I’m so scared!” &nbsp;As she spoke, she buried her face into his chest, which had grown cold from fear and terror. &nbsp;People were strange like that. &nbsp;Once A-Jiao had realized that the body lying there was a stranger to her, that it didn’t use to be someone close to her, the sight of it inexplicably struck fear in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” muttered Jiang Zhengkai as he tightly held A-Jiao’s body and caressed her icy cold face. &nbsp;He had wanted to ask how she knew it wasn’t A-Xiu, but when he felt A-Jiao shuddering in fear, he forced the words back from the tip of his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, A-Jiao’s mood gradually improved. &nbsp;She opened her eyes and turned her back on the skeleton as she said to Jiang Zhengkai, “Sister Xiu had a child. &nbsp;She delivered the baby via c-section, so she has a small scar on her lower abdomen. &nbsp;This skeleton, however, doesn’t; her lower abdomen is smooth and scarless. &nbsp;Also, Sister Xiu’s left kneecap is different from most people’s. &nbsp;She sustained an injury to her left knee when she was little, so her left kneecap isn’t round like a normal person’s.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing A-Jiao’s explanation, Jiang Zhengkai firmly kissed her cheek in excitement. &nbsp;“Thank you, Honey! &nbsp;I love you to death!” &nbsp;Right now, Jiang Zhengkai had a sense of unsuppressable excitement. &nbsp;A-Xiu wasn’t dead! &nbsp;If A-Xiu wasn’t dead, then who was the primary suspect in these serial murders? &nbsp;Duh, it was A-Xiu of course! &nbsp;Even an idiot could guess as much!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ew, gross!” complained A-Jiao as she rubbed her cheek. &nbsp;She looked back at the skeleton on the morgue bed. &nbsp;“What do you mean you love me to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry!” apologized Jiang Zhengkai as he covered her mouth. &nbsp;“My bad, Honey!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine. &nbsp;Let’s put her back and leave her in peace,” said A-Jiao as she stood next to the skeleton once more. &nbsp;She seemed to perform Buddhist burial rites for the corpse, before she placed the sheet cover back on the remains. &nbsp;Finally, she and Jiang Zhengkai pushed the body back into the morgue freezer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After exiting the morgue, even though it was still raining, A-Jiao felt much better. &nbsp;A smile appeared once more on her face. &nbsp;Obviously, she didn’t care whether A-Xiu was the serial killer. &nbsp;She was just happy that the person lying in the morgue wasn’t A-Xiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey, what did you do for that corpse just then?” asked Jiang Zhengkai as he wrapped his arm around her and unfurled the umbrella. &nbsp;He imitated the gestures A-Jiao had made with his free hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Want to learn?” asked A-Jiao as a naughty smile appeared on her face. &nbsp;“But I’m going to have to charge!” &nbsp;She reached her hand out towards Jiang Zhengkai as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! &nbsp;Is five yuan enough?” &nbsp;Seeing A-Jiao’s extended hand, he really did dig up five yuan from his pocket and placed it into A-Jiao’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you doing?” A-Jiao asked in confusion, before she realized what Jiang Zhengkai was referencing. &nbsp;“Hmph! &nbsp;You’re such a perv! &nbsp;Is sex all you think about? &nbsp;God, you’re so perverted!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;No, I’m not!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai laughed so hard he could hardly keep his back straight. &nbsp;“So… you want ten yuan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hate you! &nbsp;I hate you!” &nbsp;A-Jiao grabbed one of the yuan bill’s corners and viciously used it to slap Jiang Zhengkai’s face. &nbsp;Of course, everyone should know just how ineffective a paper bill is at inflicting pain, but then again, the purpose of the yuan bill wasn’t to act as a weapon but rather to act as an instrument of flirting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! &nbsp;Alright! &nbsp;I’m sorry!” said Jiang Zhengkai as he begged for mercy. &nbsp;He had nowhere to run in the midst of this storm, so he had to endure A-Jiao’s affectionate attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not enough! &nbsp;You have to carry me!” &nbsp;A-Jiao stopped moving her hands and placed them akimbo on her hips, as if to say she was very angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, Honey!” Jiang Zhengkai readily agreed before he squatted down. &nbsp;“But you have to tell me what you did to that body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haven’t you ever heard of the saying ‘curiosity killed the cat?’” said A-Jiao as she climbed onto Jiang Zhengkai’s back. &nbsp;“That was a Tibetan Buddhist burial rite meant to release the soul from purgatory. &nbsp;Stop laughing! &nbsp;I learned the ritual from a living buddha!” &nbsp;She made a sly smile as she viciously rapped his head with her knuckles. &nbsp;“Alright! &nbsp;Let’s go home!”</span></p>
