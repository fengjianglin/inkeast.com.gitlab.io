 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 25: A-Tie's Confession</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Jiang Zhengkai was about to give up, his desk telephone rang again. &nbsp;“Jiang, it’s Zhang,” said Zhang Nan over the phone. &nbsp;“I have a new lead here. &nbsp;This morning, the post office delivered a letter to Zhu Yuping’s residence. &nbsp;It was sent from Sichuan Province. &nbsp;The letter has already been intercepted by our colleagues patrolling the neighborhood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;A letter from Sichuan?” Jiang Zhengkai repeated. &nbsp;He didn’t think it was that strange for Zhu Yuping to have a friend or relative in Sichuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct, except the letter wasn’t directly addressed to Zhu Yuping,” Zhang Nan continued. &nbsp;“The envelope was addressed to Lu Xiaomei, care of Zhu Yuping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Xiaomei?” &nbsp;The importance of that name soon dawned on him. “Wait, is that the female victim in the first case, Xiaomei?” &nbsp;</span><i><span style>That’s right, Sichuan! &nbsp;Xiaomei was Sichuanese!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;A-Jiao had told him that. &nbsp;Furthermore, he recalled seeing the name Lu Xiaomei in Xiaomei’s case file.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, Jiang,” Zhang Nan replied. &nbsp;“I’ve already read the letter. &nbsp;It’s just an ordinary letter from her family. &nbsp;However, there was one thing in the letter that I found interesting. &nbsp;The letter said that her mother’s health had significantly improved and that her older brother was going to graduate this year, so Xiaomei could stop sending her monthly remittances home. &nbsp;It also said that Xiaomei sent home too much money last month, that her family had no need for that much money. &nbsp;Oh, and the letter ended by telling her to take care of herself or something along those lines.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone sent money to Xiaomei’s family after she died?” an astonished Jiang Zhengkai asked. &nbsp;Xiaomei had died more than two months ago, so she obviously couldn’t have sent the money. &nbsp;But if it wasn’t her, then who could it have been? &nbsp;Just then, a familiar voice echoed in his mind…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Can you take me to the post office?”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“I’m going to wire my parents some money. &nbsp;They’re waiting to use it.”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“No peeping while I type in my PIN!”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao? &nbsp;Xiaomei? &nbsp;Could it be that A-Jiao was Xiaomei? &nbsp;Or did A-Jiao send money on behalf of Xiaomei? &nbsp;If Jiang Zhengkai had to choose, he naturally would have chosen to believe the latter, but common sense dictated that he chose the former. &nbsp;After all, A-Jiao was a prostitute, a woman who sold her body for money. &nbsp;Was it possible that her sentimentality outweighed her greed, so much so that she sent her hard-earned money to another woman’s family? &nbsp;No, it didn’t make sense. &nbsp;Then did that mean that the first victim was in fact A-Jiao as opposed to Xiaomei?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang, what about A-Jiao? &nbsp;Do you have any more documents on her?” Jiang Zhengkai paused his train of thought to ask Zhang Nan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao?” Zhang Nan asked before falling silent for a moment. &nbsp;“Wasn’t she the witness to the first two cases? &nbsp;To tell you the truth, I really don’t know that much about her. &nbsp;She’s not a regular who works everyday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? &nbsp;There are part-timers even in that profession?” Jiang Zhengkai chuckled. &nbsp;Were there prostitutes who only worked Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and took off Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About that, yeah, there actually are,” Zhang Nan laughingly replied. &nbsp;“In any case, I’ll go back and get some more information from A-Shun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. &nbsp;After you’ve obtained more information, call me immediately,” Jiang Zhengkai said before hanging up the phone. &nbsp;However, he suddenly felt A-Jiao standing right in front of him, hands on her hips, indignantly saying, “</span><i><span style>I’ll work whenever I feel like working! &nbsp;You don’t control me, you damn cop!</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, did you need me to do anything over by Ju’an Road tonight?” Wei Xin popped in and asked. &nbsp;She was wearing civilian attire, since according to the duty roster, it was her turn to stand watch in the alley tonight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, no, thank you,” Jiang Zhengkai shook his head. &nbsp;He added, “Oh, but one more thing. If you see A-Shun tonight, remember to ask him if he knows where A-Jiao is. &nbsp;Also, it’ll be cold tonight, so make sure to wear some more clothes.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai took a look at what Wei Xin was wearing, which wasn’t a whole lot. &nbsp;Since she was playing the part of a prostitute, it made sense that she was dressed for the part. &nbsp;You wouldn’t expect her to walk the streets in her police uniform, would you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I look pretty?” Wei Xin asked. &nbsp;She took no heed of what Jiang Zhengkai had said to her, and was instead worried about her overall appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, not bad,” Jiang Zhengkai helplessly answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! &nbsp;Next time I take you out to dinner, I’ll make sure to dress like this,” teased Wei Xin before she whipped her head around and ran out of the room. &nbsp;“Don’t stay too late, Inspector Jiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai sat there and sighed. &nbsp;He understood what Wei Xin was trying to get at, but there was no place in his heart for Wei Xin. &nbsp;If there were only two women left in this world, and he had to choose between Wei Xin and A-Jiao, then he would choose the latter, not because A-Jiao was better than Wei Xin, but rather because every soul had scars hidden deep within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As night descended, Jiang Zhengkai parked his car near the vicinity of Uncle Cai’s noodle shop. &nbsp;He walked into the noodle shop, found himself a table, and hollered, “Uncle Cai! &nbsp;One large bowl of hand-cut noodles! &nbsp;And make sure to give me some extra paste, too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got it!” Uncle Cai hollered in response as he walked over to wipe down the table. &nbsp;“How come you’ve been coming by yourself recently? &nbsp;Where did that girl A-Jiao go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s traveling,” Jiang Zhengkai responded vaguely. &nbsp;Except for those days when he had to work overtime, he had been coming to Uncle Cai’s every night since A-Jiao had been discharged from the hospital. &nbsp;Sometimes it was to eat a bowl of noodles; other times it was to exchange some chit-chat with Uncle Cai. &nbsp;It was a routine that he had settled into, just like how he would park his car in front of Ju’an Estates and smoke a cigarette before going home for the night. &nbsp;There, he waited hopefully for the light in A-Jiao’s home to suddenly turn on. &nbsp;Here, he desperately yearned for a woman to walk in and yell, “Uncle Cai! &nbsp;A bowl of hand-cut noodles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving Uncle Cai’s, he drove his car to Ju’an Estates as usual. &nbsp;However, he stayed there for a very long time this night, because his work during the day irritated him greatly. &nbsp;Right before he’d left the office, he had notified his colleagues at External Affairs to go to the post office and track down the recipient of A-Jiao’s wire transfer. &nbsp;He hoped that by tracking down the wire transfer’s destination, he would be able to find out more information about A-Jiao or Xiaomei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t care if the woman who lived here was really called A-Jiao or Xiaomei. &nbsp;All he knew was that couldn’t let go of that woman, even though she was a prostitute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, Jiang Zhengkai didn’t go to work at the sub-bureau. &nbsp;He first drove to the alley, where he picked up the pimp A-Tie and brought him to the Ju’an Road Police Station for questioning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the interrogation room, Jiang Zhengkai asked him, “A-Tie, where did A-Shun go these last couple of days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! &nbsp;Yeah, he took a couple of days off. &nbsp;His kid’s sick,” A-Tie replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about A-Jiao? &nbsp;What do you know about her?” Jiang Zhengkai continued his questioning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao? &nbsp;She hasn’t been around for a while now,” A-Tie answered. &nbsp;“She’s not a bad person, but she does have a bad temper and likes to beat people. &nbsp;Other than that, I’ve got nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bad temper and likes to beat people, huh?” &nbsp;Considering his interactions with A-Jiao, Jiang Zhengkai was inclined to agree. &nbsp;“Then, what about Xiaomei?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She was a clever kid,” A-Tie sighed at Jiang Zhengkai’s mention of Xiaomei. &nbsp;“She came out to work on the streets because her family needed money. &nbsp;Of all the women in the alley, she was the most hardworking one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let me ask you, what was her relationship with Zhu Yuping?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think they had a relationship,” A-Tie candidly replied. &nbsp;“What would the two of them have had to do with one another anyway? &nbsp;Oh, I remember now! &nbsp;Xiaomei often asked Zhu Yuping to help her write letters home because she was functionally illiterate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And what about A-Jiao?” Jiang Zhengkai changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao? &nbsp;She’s beautiful, liked to surf the internet, seemed like she was well-educated. &nbsp;She didn’t really hang out with the other girls when she wasn’t working,” described A-Tie before pausing for a moment. &nbsp;“She had a pretty good relationship with Xiaomei, actually. &nbsp;Mostly because she didn’t bully Xiaomei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was Xiaomei was frequently bullied by others?” Jiang Zhengkai asked, focusing all of his attention on A-Tie’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, she was young, and she was small. &nbsp;Even though she had been working in the alley for two or three years, the other women still liked to take their anger out on her. &nbsp;I mean, these women are treated like sex toys by men on a daily basis, so of course there’s a lot of pent-up anger and frustration,” A-Tie said matter-of-factly. &nbsp;“Half a year ago, A-Jiao took Xiaomei under her wing, and the other girls in the alley stopped bullying her, because whoever picked on Xiaomei would be paid back with interest by A-Jiao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Paid back?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai gently tapped the table. &nbsp;“How would she pay them back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, normally A-Jiao’s a pretty nice person, but if you fucked with her, she could turn into a real nasty bitch. &nbsp;Plus, she has backup, so no one in the alley wanted to mess with her,” A-Tie responded with a smile on his face. &nbsp;“We’re obviously not going to pay anyone back by calling the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then who was it that died in the first murder?” Jiang Zhengkai suddenly asked with feigned casualness. &nbsp;He already knew what A-Tie meant by “backup”; A-Jiao must have had ties to the Triads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaomei, wasn’t it?” A-Tie answered in astonishment. &nbsp;“Wait, are you saying it wasn’t her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was Xiaomei’s real name?” Jiang Zhengkai asked, ignoring A-Tie’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Real name? &nbsp;Nobody cares what your real name is in our line of profession,” A-Tie scratched his head. &nbsp;“I think Xiaomei was Sichuanese and had the last name Lu. &nbsp;I think I remember A-Shun mentioning it once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And how often did A-Jiao work?” Jiang Zhengkai asked his last question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her? &nbsp;She worked when she felt like it,” A-Tie replied. &nbsp;“She didn’t actually care all that much about money, which made her different from the other women in the alley. &nbsp;After Xiaomei died, she worked harder for a while, but look at how she just up and disappeared for more than a month now.”</span></p>
