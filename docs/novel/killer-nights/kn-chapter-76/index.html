 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 76: Uncle Gao's True Identity</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>By the time A-Sha was escorted out by Lu Xiaoqiang and Guo Wei, a critical piece of information that should have been uncovered two years ago was finally made clear by Jiang Zhengkai's dogged interrogation. &nbsp;He now confirmed that A-Xiu had organized the women in the alley into a drug distribution ring. &nbsp;What needed answering now was the number of prostitutes involved and the volume of drugs dealt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ringleader of this conspiracy was A-Xiu, but her current status was either dead or missing. &nbsp;Over the past two years, nobody had known about her whereabouts. &nbsp;Based on previous evidence, A-Xiu died in one of the alley murders a few months ago, but according to this newly-uncovered evidence, A-Xiu might still be alive but just missing. &nbsp;Whether she was really alive or dead, no one knew for sure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We did pretty well today, I'd say!" said Jiang Zhengkai with a laugh at the sullen-looking Zhang Nan beside him, "Look, it wasn't your fault that we haven't been able to crack this case, so stop blaming yourself for it."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ai! &nbsp;Something that I wasn't able to figure out even after spending an inordinate amount of time was easily discovered by you after just a few interrogation sessions," said Zhang Nan as he bitterly shook his head, "Fortune favors the young indeed."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha!" &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai purposely laughed out loud at what Zhang Nan had said. &nbsp;"Hey brother, I'm not that much younger than you are. &nbsp;I'm old, too, just like you! &nbsp;They're the real young ones, haha!" said Jiang Zhengkai as he pointed at Lu Xiaoqiang and Guo Wei, who had just returned to the interrogation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ai! &nbsp;Whatever you say!" sighed Zhang Nan as he closed his notebook in frustration. &nbsp;He then said to Jiang Zhengkai, "Let's go! &nbsp;I'll be buying the drinks tonight!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai was just about to say yes, but suddenly his cell phone rang. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai knew that the only person who would call him at this hour was A-Jiao. &nbsp;He picked up his phone and then smiled sheepishly at Zhang Nan, "Look, brother, it's not that I don't want to go out drinking with you, but I'm not exactly a free man these days."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, you're the worst!" said Zhang Nan as he pointed his finger up and down at Jiang Zhengkai, "Oh well, I guess I'd also be running home as soon as I can if I had such a beautiful girl at home!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, you need to be careful about what you say around here!" joked Jiang Zhengkai, "Aren’t you afraid that one of us might rat you out to your wife? &nbsp;Haha!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Fine, fine! &nbsp;I'll let you go only because I don’t want you to rat me out to my wife," said Zhang Nan as he started to get up out of his chair. &nbsp;He then flagged down Lu Xiaoqiang and Guo Wei, "Come on! &nbsp;You two are going to be my drinking buddies tonight!" &nbsp;Meanwhile, Jiang Zhengkai had already hid himself away in a corner so he could talk intimately with A-Jiao. &nbsp;Zhang Nan turned around to see Jiang Zhengkai had already left. &nbsp;He pointed his finger at Jiang Zhengkai's back and said, "That bastard has chosen love over friendship, I see! &nbsp;Whatever, let's go!" &nbsp;Afterwards, he left the interrogation room with Lu Xiaoqiang and Guo Wei in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later, Jiang Zhengkai arrived promptly at the designated time inside Uncle Cai's noodle shop. &nbsp;It was already mid-summer, and it often rained during the summer in this city. &nbsp;Today's rain was downright torrential, and its arrival had washed away this city's oppressive heat as well as Uncle Cai's clientele. &nbsp;By the time Jiang Zhengkai arrived, A-Jiao had already sat down at a table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Honey! &nbsp;You're all wet! &nbsp;Here, let me help you wipe your face." &nbsp;Seeing that Jiang Zhengkai was drenched, A-Jiao used her handkerchief to wipe the rainwater off of his head and face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, it's not a big deal, really!" Jiang Zhengkai said laughingly, "They dropped me off nearby, but the rain just came down too hard." &nbsp;As he spoke, he took out a long plastic bag. &nbsp;Inside were A-Jiao’s portraits. &nbsp;“Good, it didn’t get wet!” said Jiang Zhengkai as he inspected the portraits like he would some precious treasures. &nbsp;Only after he was satisfied that they weren’t damaged did he put them down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! &nbsp;You dummy!” &nbsp;A-Jiao said with dissatisfaction when she saw how Jiang Zhengkai cared more for her portraits than he did for his own body, “If these get wet, I can draw them again, but what would happen if you were to catch a cold from being drenched?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess you’ll just have to take care of me then,” Jiang Zhengkai whispered quietly into A-Jiao’s ear, “Just like how I took care of you while you were in the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so annoying!” exclaimed A-Jiao as she lightly punched Jiang Zhengkai several times, “I didn’t need you to take care of me! &nbsp;You volunteered!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? &nbsp;So you wouldn’t volunteer to take care of me if I got sick?” asked Jiang Zhengkai with a look of hurt on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I won’t! &nbsp;You’ll have to pay me for my time and effort!” said A-Jiao as she extended her hand towards Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right then, the restaurant’s server Uncle Gao walked over and said, “What’s going on? &nbsp;Why are the two of you haggling over money?” &nbsp;Even though there were fewer customers because of the heavy rainfall, there were nevertheless about a dozen people eating at the restaurant, which meant Uncle Cai still couldn’t catch a break.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s nothing,” A-Jiao smiled at Uncle Gao, “He didn’t listen to me and got drenched. &nbsp;He then said he wanted me to take care of him if he got sick! &nbsp;Uncle Gao, don’t you think he should reimburse me for taking care of him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, of course!” Uncle Gao laughingly responded to A-Jiao, “He needs to do everything you tell him to do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See! &nbsp;Even Uncle Gao thinks I’m in the right! &nbsp;What do you have to say now, huh?” &nbsp;After hearing Uncle Gao’s words of support, A-Jiao playfully swung her head back and forth while she squinted her eyes at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! &nbsp;This is your turf, so of course the people here would side with you!” &nbsp;Seeing her arrogant demeanor, Jiang Zhengkai intentionally tried to scare her, “As soon as we leave, I’m going to cuff you and take you into custody!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Gao! &nbsp;See, he’s even threatening me now! &nbsp;He says he’s going to arrest me!” pouted A-Jiao as she pointed at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;I dare him to!” &nbsp;Uncle Gao placed the noodles down on the table and said, “He doesn’t scare me one bit! &nbsp;I used to be a police officer as well when I was young. &nbsp;I guess you could say I’m an old copper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” &nbsp;Hearing what Uncle Gao had just said, Jiang Zhengkai suddenly turned around and carefully sized up the old man. &nbsp;The speaker didn’t think much about what he said, but the listener carefully remembered everything that was being said. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai suddenly remembered something Zhang Nan had told him. &nbsp;He said that the former commanding sergeant of his police station who was transferred and forced into retirement had the surname Gao. &nbsp;Could it be that Uncle Gao was the retired sergeant that Zhang Nan had told him about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right!” Uncle Gao laughed as he replied, “Why would an old man like me lie to you?” &nbsp;As he turned around and left A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai’s table, he added, “I used to command a police station in this city of ours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was him! &nbsp;Hearing Uncle Gao’s final remark caused Jiang Zhengkai’s eyes to light up. &nbsp;He never would have guessed in a million years that this old server working for Uncle Cai was in fact the very ex-Commanding Sergeant of the Ju’an Road Police Station that they had been looking for all this time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you so excited about?” &nbsp;A-Jiao obviously detected something unusual in Jiang Zhengkai’s demeanor. &nbsp;She put her hand in front of Jiang Zhengkai’s face and waved it back and forth. &nbsp;She then said naughtily, “Honey, Uncle Gao is a geriatric. &nbsp;You wouldn’t happen to be interested in him, are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You damn girl!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai reached over and squeezed A-Jiao’s nose in response to what she said. &nbsp;Being with A-Jiao, Jiang Zhengkai felt like his mood and temperament had changed quite a bit. &nbsp;It almost felt like he had returned to his youth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why are you staring at him?” &nbsp;A-Jiao’s expression was one part curiosity and one part jealousy. &nbsp;Who said A-Jiao didn’t get jealous? &nbsp;Just because she was a prostitute didn’t mean she didn’t behave like a normal woman! &nbsp;As a normal woman, she would be jealous of anyone and anything that her man was interested in other than herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me tell you something. &nbsp;Uncle Gao is very possibly an important witness that I’ve been trying to find all this time.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked in all directions and then quietly said to A-Jiao, “Honey, I’ll need you to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, stop!” &nbsp;A-Jiao extended her hand and covered Jiang Zhengkai’s mouth, “You need my help again, don’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup!” Jiang Zhengkai nodded and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it! &nbsp;You always need something from me when you call me Honey.” &nbsp;A-Jiao grit her teeth, then pinched Jiang Zhengkai’s nose before saying, “Ok, go ahead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, umm, Ziyuan…” &nbsp;Having heard what A-Jiao just said, Jiang Zhengkai decided to call A-Jiao by her name, but little did he know that it would only make things worse. &nbsp;His head, which had been extended toward A-Jiao to be closer to her, was immediately met with a strong blow from A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you stupid or something? &nbsp;Do you want my help or not?” shouted A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey! &nbsp;Honey!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai was nothing if not adaptable. &nbsp;Seeing A-Jiao getting angry with him caused him to immediately switch back to calling her “Honey.” &nbsp;It looked like Jiang Zhengkai was the consummate chameleon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai put their heads together and quietly chatted amongst themselves for a while before A-Jiao nodded in tacit understanding. &nbsp;Their two heads then separated again as they continued with their meal. &nbsp;When they finished with their dinner, A-Jiao called for Uncle Gao to deliver them their check. &nbsp;Meanwhile, Jiang Zhengkai purposely grabbed A-Jiao’s portraits in his hand but didn’t open them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Gao, I wanted to ask if you could help me with something,” A-Jiao asked Uncle Gao with a helpless expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure thing!” Uncle Gao crisply agreed, “I’ll help you out in any way I can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok, here I go!” &nbsp;Hearing how Uncle Gao had agreed to help, A-Jiao pursed her lips and asked, “I have a long-lost sister. &nbsp;I heard she’s here in this city. &nbsp;Zhengkai and I have been trying to find her for a long time, but we still haven’t been able to make any progress. &nbsp;Do you think you could help us find her?”</span></p>
