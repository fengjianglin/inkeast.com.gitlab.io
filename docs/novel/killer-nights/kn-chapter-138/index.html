 <p>Jiang Zhengkai slowly walked through the alley and towards the house selected by Zhang Nan. He deliberately walked slowly, taking in the scenery behind him. However, he was disappointed that nothing felt wrong, besides when the occasional woman came up to talk to him. Normally, the walk from the alley to A-Jiao’s location should have only taken three minutes, but Jiang Zhengkai took ten minutes this time and even that felt too fast. Why can I already see A-Jiao? Is the moment that I’ve been agonizing about already here?</p>
 <p>"Handsome, do you want some company?" A-Jiao teased when she saw Jiang Zhengkai approaching her. She leaned against Jiang Zhengkai flirtatiously as she blinked and looked at Jiang Zhengkai charmingly. "It's cheap. What do you think?"</p>
 <p>"Ah! Oh." A-Jiao's relaxed expression rendered Jiang Zhengkai speechless. Policemen were masters at wiping out prostitution rings, but not everyone was a master at pretending to be a client. Of course, there were still quite some masters among the children of the policemen. For example, Li Hongbin, and…</p>
 <p>"What’s wrong? Are you shy?" A-Jiao cut his thoughts short as she leaned even closer to Jiang Zhengkai’s chest and continued to taunt him. "Or did you forget to bring your wallet?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah! I’m a bit low on cash." Jiang Zhengkai was amused by A-Jiao's words. He held back his smile and nodded. "Babe, I am poor. Not much cash!"</p>
 <p>"Fuck! Bro, you come to this place without any money?" A-Jiao burst into foul words, and lightly poked Jiang Zhengkai’s head with her finger. "Who do you think you are? Did you come here looking for a one-night stand? Do you think that you are Edison Chen?"</p>
 <p>"I… I don’t!" Jiang Zhengkai held back his smile again, and shook his head as if he were conflicted. Nonetheless, he was still willing to cooperate with A-Jiao and carry on this farcical game of mutual pretending. "I am poor. I can't even afford a camera."</p>
 <p>"You can't afford a camera? Then buy a recording pen instead!" A-Jiao glanced at Jiang Zhengkai with some disdain. "Okay! I am in a good mood tonight, so I will take you on for free! Let’s go!"</p>
 <p>"Big sis! A hundred, okay?" Jiang Zhengkai gently tugged A-Jiao's sleeves and pretended to look pitiful. "A hundred!"</p>
 <p>"A hundred?" A-Jiao stared at Jiang Zhengkai with a confused blink. Suddenly, she acted as if she realized what he was saying. "Oh! Ok! Ok! It’s been decided. After we’re done, I will give you a hundred, alright?"</p>
 <p>"Yes! Yes!" Jiang Zhengkai nodded quickly, then he leaned over A-Jiao's ear and muttered, "That’s enough! Let's go."</p>
 <p>"Oh! But I don’t see anyone behind you?" A-Jiao also whispered back to Jiang Zhengkai.</p>
 <p>"Maybe that guy is taking a break today." Jiang Zhengkai looked around through the corner of his eyes, and then had no choice but to answer, "Let's go! Whatever. Even if he doesn't appear, we can’t just stand around chatting the whole night, right?"</p>
 <p>"Oh, okay!" A-Jiao replied, then raised her voice. "What? Six hundred for the whole night? No! I said no. Let’s just go!"</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhengkai felt sweat drip down his back. His neck also seemed to be stiff as a piece of wood. He twisted his neck to the left and right mechanically, and then followed A-Jiao towards the house selected by Zhang Nan.</p>
 <p>On the way, A-Jiao gently took Jiang Zhengkai's arm into hers as they proceeded. Neither of them spoke anymore, as both of their hearts felt like they were about to burst out of their chests.&nbsp;Could it be that the mysterious killer won’t appear tonight? Perhaps they will stay alive for another day?&nbsp;Humans were strange creatures. The moment they sensed danger, they would sentence themselves to death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Trembling, A-Jiao took the key out from her pocket when they arrived at their destination. "Old... handsome, it seems... oh..." It seemed that she wanted to say something, but couldn’t find the right words. A-Jiao was now completely different from the naughty alley version of herself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It’s fine! No worries!" Jiang Zhengkai stood behind A-Jiao, gently placing his hand on her shoulder. "Don’t worry. It’ll be fine."</p>
 <p>A-Jiao nodded and turned the key in her hand.&nbsp;Pa!&nbsp;She finally managed to open the door. "Come in!" A-Jiao's voice had already shifted to another different pitch as she trembled and pulled the key out from the door.</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhengkai followed her and gently pushed A-Jiao into the apartment. He did not close the door immediately, but instead stood beside the door and asked, "Which room?"</p>
 <p>"He... here!" A-Jiao continued walking and pointed to the bedroom on the south side with her trembling arm. "Come on!"</p>
 <p>"Alright then," Jiang Zhengkai replied, before gently closing the door. However, Jiang Zhengkai left the door unlocked. After all, he was a policeman and still remembered his duties. Since the killer had not followed them, he had to leave him a back door!</p>
 <p>After A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai removed their clothes, they got onto the bed. A-Jiao didn’t feel a single trace of warmth as her body laid icily beneath Jiang Zhengkai’s. When Jiang Zhengkai closed the gap, A-Jiao leaned her head against Jiang Zhengkai’s shoulder and stuttered, “We… are we really going to… make love?”</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Jiang Zhengkai replied, but did not move. He tenderly hugged A-Jiao’s cold body. After almost half an hour, A-Jiao whispered in Jiang Zhengkai’s arms, "Let's do it then? It's been so long. They are waiting for us."</p>
 <p>"Oh!" Jiang Zhengkai got up to shift his body to enter A-Jiao. After, the two of them made intense love with each other, Jiang Zhengkai tightly held A-Jiao raptly. "Honey, I don’t think he came."</p>
 <p>"What? You miss him? Maybe he’s taking a break?" A-Jiao and buried her head in Jiang Zhengkai’s chest as she exclaimed, "Honey, hug me! I love you."</p>
 <p>In the north surveillance room, Mu Mingyuan stared at the monitor's screen. Although he could not clearly see what Jiang Zhengkai and A-Jiao were doing, he knew that they had stopped moving. "What? It’s over already?" Mu Mingyuan was bored and threw his pen aside. "It wasn’t intense at all!"</p>
 <p>"Hehe, not enough?" Zhang Nan glanced at him. "Why don’t you do it next time?"</p>
 <p>"Me? Forget it!" Mu Mingyuan shook his head. "This is a life-risking job, so I’d rather let Jiang do it himself! However, I should remind him next time to take supplements so that he’ll last longer in bed."</p>
 <p>"I think that you’ve been watching too much porn!" Zhang Nan mocked with curled lips.</p>
 <p>"Well then, I will visit Inspector Jiang!" Lu Xiaoqiang, who had been dozing off to the side, stood up and reached for the door.</p>
 <p>"You must follow the rules!" Zhang Nan quietly reminded him. "You’re not allowed to enter the room unless something happens. Besides, do you want to die? Did you forget that the electric floor is currently active?" Zhang Nan pressed a red button next to the monitor. It turned out that ever since Jiang Zhengkai and A-Jiao had gotten onto the bed, the wall, floor, ceiling, and even the windows and doors of the entire southern room had all been turned into a terrifying electric grid by Zhang Nan.</p>
 <p>"Shall we get dressed?" A long time passed before A-Jiao winked at Jiang Zhengkai. "If we continue lying in bed, they will probably turn anxious from the wait." A-Jiao’s head was leaning against Jiang Zhengkai's arms again.</p>
 <p>"Alright," Jiang Zhengkai replied, then reached over to the head of the bed. There was a button hidden there as well.</p>
 <p>"Ring! Ring!" The bell in the surveillance room rang. Mu Mingyuan curled his lips and smiled. "Hey! Are those two treating the room as their wedding room?"</p>
 <p>"Well I guess they can!" Zhang Nan yawned in front of the monitor. "Tomorrow I’ll have to have the technical department install a microphone in the room! Otherwise those two will not come out after they go in."</p>
 <p>"What? It's already dawn?" Lu Xiaoqiang had obviously been woken up by the ring. He rubbed his eyes and crawled up. "Everyone is still here? What time is it?" He glanced at the clock on the wall. "It’s just 2 am, so why are they ringing the bell?"</p>
 <p>"Do you think I wanted to ring it?" Zhang Nan glared at him. "Our Inspector Jiang and Miss Ren finally woke up and got out of bed!" He waved at Lu Xiaoqiang, "Go ahead, Servant Xiaoqiang! Go greet our emperor and empress, and then ask them if they want some midnight snacks."</p>
