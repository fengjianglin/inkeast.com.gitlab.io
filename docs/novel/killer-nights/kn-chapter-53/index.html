 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Inside the hospital, Jiang Zhengkai waited for the doctor to call A-Jiao’s name, but A-Jiao ran straight to Dr. Wang’s office.&nbsp; She barged in, not caring who else was in the office, as she shouted, “Hi, Grandma Wang!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You impudent little hussy!” Dr. Wang retorted.&nbsp; She had been discussing something with a young resident, but as soon as she saw A-Jiao nonchalantly rushing in, she knew this little girl was going to make fun of her age again.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I see you’re busy with a patient, Dr. Wang.&nbsp; I’ll be off to prepare the test results then,” said the young resident doctor.&nbsp; She glanced at A-Jiao, smiled at Dr. Wang, and then left the office.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What are you doing here today?” Dr. Wang said, sitting with a purposely serious expression.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I’m here for my check-up.&nbsp; You didn’t think I came here because I missed you, did you?” teased A-Jiao.&nbsp; She straddled a chair, crossed her arms, and rocked back and forth as she spoke to Dr. Wang.&nbsp; She looked almost like a middle school student.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You’re getting less and less mature, aren’t you?” Dr. Wang grumpily asked her as she saw how A-Jiao acted. &nbsp;“You’ll be ready to go back to preschool in a few years at this rate.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“My goodness, ma’am!&nbsp; How ever did you know?” &nbsp;A-Jiao sat on the chair and repeatedly nodded her head.&nbsp; Even though she came back every month for a check-up, A-Jiao had never brought up her new job.&nbsp; Dr. Wang had asked her, but A-Jiao steadfastly refused to answer.&nbsp; At the end of the day, Dr. Wang didn’t force the issue.&nbsp; After all, patients had a right to privacy.&nbsp; Well, A-Jiao could do whatever she wanted as long as she didn’t end up turning tricks on the street again.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Behave yourself!” grimaced Dr. Wang as she stood up and pointed at the hospital bed. &nbsp;“Get up there!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Fine!&nbsp; It’s not like I did anything wrong,” said A-Jiao as she helplessly stood up from her chair and crawled onto the bed.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Right at that moment, Jiang Zhengkai walked into Dr. Wang’s office and called out, “Dr. Wang, here’s Zi-- A-Jiao’s number!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh, I see the two of you came together.” &nbsp;Dr. Wang glanced at Jiang Zhengkai and then turned her attention back to A-Jiao.&nbsp; She seemed to have understood what was going on.&nbsp; At her age, how could she not see what was going on here?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, yeah,” Jiang Zhengkai replied with an embarrassed laugh. &nbsp;“How is she?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dr. Wang’s eyes sparkled as she looked at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“What?&nbsp; You didn’t examine her yourself?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“I… no… umm… I didn’t!” Jiang Zhengkai vigorously shook his head in response.&nbsp; He couldn’t act out of line in front of Dr. Wang.&nbsp; After her, she was Yao Tianyu’s sister-in-law.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Then you should wait here,” ordered Dr. Wang.&nbsp; She looked suspiciously at Jiang Zhengkai before pulling the curtain around the hospital bed.&nbsp; Since Jiang Zhengkai wasn’t romantically involved with A-Jiao, hospital rules dictated that she had to protect the patient’s privacy. &nbsp;Did I misjudge them? &nbsp;she thought to herself.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">About <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_66556062"><span class="aQJ">ten minutes later</span></span>, both Dr. Wang and A-Jiao appeared from behind the curtain. &nbsp;“Your recovery is going well,” said Dr. Wang as she returned to her chair. &nbsp;“Jiang, could you give us the room for a minute?” &nbsp;Obviously, Dr. Wang didn’t think it was appropriate for Jiang Zhengkai to hear what she had to say next.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“It’s okay!” exclaimed A-Jiao as she looked at Dr. Wang with pursed lips. &nbsp;“I’m going to work in his home after this.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Oh?” Dr. Wang looked at A-Jiao in surprise. &nbsp;“You’re going to work in his home?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yup, that’s right!” &nbsp;A-Jiao stuck out her tongue. &nbsp;“His home needs a maid, and I’m perfect for the job!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Dr. Wang, don’t listen to her nonsense!” interjected Jiang Zhengkai as he walked behind A-Jiao and covered her mouth with his hand.&nbsp; He was afraid A-Jiao would let slip something that she shouldn’t say.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe, this old lady has neither the time nor the inclination to care about you two’s business,” Dr. Wang chuckled as she saw the expression on their faces. &nbsp;“A-Jiao, remember to get plenty of rest.&nbsp; You are recovering quite well, but you can’t have intercourse too often, ok?” &nbsp;After she finished speaking to A-Jiao, Dr. Wang shifted her gaze to Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“And you!&nbsp; Remember to mind your personal hygiene!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Personal hygiene?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at Dr. Wang in confusion.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Yes, personal hygiene!” said Dr. Wang.&nbsp; She looked down and wrote in A-Jiao’s medical record, &nbsp;completely ignoring Jiang Zhengkai’s expression. &nbsp;“A-Jiao only just recovered down there, so you need to mind your personal hygiene to prevent her from getting any infections.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t you worry, ma’am!&nbsp; Our Uncle Policeman there loves being clean,” said A-Jiao as she got up and shuffled to the office entrance. &nbsp;“I always scrub his junk down with a brush before we do it!” &nbsp;As soon as she finished speaking, she slid right out the office door.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Ha!” Dr. Wang couldn’t help but laugh out loud as she momentarily stopped writing in A-Jiao’s medical record.&nbsp; She looked at Jiang Zhengkai from behind her glasses. &nbsp;“Hehe, here’s her medical record, so get going!&nbsp; Take good care of her!&nbsp; I can tell that little wench is very happy today.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Dr. Wang!” &nbsp;Fully red in the face, Jiang Zhengkai snatched A-Jiao’s medical record and ran off without so much as a second look.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Remember to come back for your next checkup!” Dr. Wang called out after them.&nbsp; The old lady sighed as she saw those two young people walk away.&nbsp; In all the years that she’d known Jiang Zhengkai, she had never seen him as relaxed as he was today.&nbsp; Perhaps A-Jiao really could fill the void that Su Jing had left in Jiang Zhengkai’s heart and allow him to find happiness again.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the hospital’s courtyard, Jiang Zhengkai caught up to A-Jiao and grabbed her. &nbsp;“What did you say back there, you crazy woman?” he asked, displeased.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What’s wrong, Honey?&nbsp; I wasn’t really going to scrub it with a brush,” A-Jiao replied with a pitiful expression on her face.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can you not act all crazy in front of Dr. Wang?” chastised Jiang Zhengkai as he forcefully tugged on her nose. &nbsp;“She is Commissioner Yao’s sister-in-law!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“What?&nbsp; Really?” &nbsp;She immediately pouted her mouth, looking like she was about to cry. &nbsp;“You didn’t tell me that!&nbsp; How was I supposed to know?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe!&nbsp; Well, you didn’t ask,” replied Jiang Zhengkai.&nbsp; But when he saw the expression on A-Jiao’s face, he felt a sudden rush of sadness.&nbsp; He immediately grabbed A-Jiao and held her tightly in his embrace. &nbsp;“Don’t worry!&nbsp; She won’t tell Commissioner Yao anything.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“But… but, what if she does say something?” said A-Jiao as she bit her lips. &nbsp;“In case… in case Commissioner Yao won’t let me be with you… what would we do then?” &nbsp;Tears fell onto A-Jiao’s cheeks like a string of translucent pearls.&nbsp; She knew the real reason why Jiang Zhengkai stopped coming to see her when she was hospitalized.&nbsp; Although Wei Xin was a few years older than A-Jiao, she was not nearly as cunning.&nbsp; A-Jiao had gleaned all of this information when Wei Xin had been assigned to take care of her.&nbsp; That was why A-Jiao eventually decided to leave the city.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Don’t worry!&nbsp; If he won’t let us be together, then I’ll resign and help Uncle Cai sell noodles,” said Jiang Zhengkai as he tightly hugged A-Jiao.&nbsp; Right now, he wasn’t going to let anything stand in the way of the two of them being together.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Okay… Honey, can you not be mad at me?&nbsp; I promise I won’t act all crazy anymore, alright?” said A-Jiao as she continued sobbing in his arms.&nbsp; She loved Jiang Zhengkai, so naturally she didn’t want him to give up his cherished career.&nbsp; Even though she was young, even though she had been a prostitute, she nevertheless knew that she would rather make sacrifices for the person she loved than for that person to make sacrifices for her.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Jiang Zhengkai saw how distraught A-Jiao was and knew that nothing he could say would make her feel better.&nbsp; In fact, he knew that the more he said, the more pain he was going to cause her, because that pain was caused by her own self-blame.&nbsp; The more he said he didn’t care, the more she would think he was purposely lying to her to make her happy.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">In the hospital’s courtyard, Jiang Zhengkai held A-Jiao for a long while.&nbsp; When he heard her sobs becoming more intermittent, he suddenly grabbed her by the waist and lifted her onto his shoulder, before running straight out of the courtyard.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Hehe… umm… what are you doing?” shouted A-Jiao in between laughs and sobs. &nbsp;“Put me down!&nbsp; Stop playing!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Haha!&nbsp; What are you afraid of?&nbsp; You’re my girl now!” &nbsp;When Jiang Zhengkai said these words, he didn’t feel the slightest shred of discomfort.&nbsp; Apparently, A-Jiao really had replaced Su Jing in his heart.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“You’re so annoying!” &nbsp;A-Jiao had fully stopped crying at this point. &nbsp;“Ow!&nbsp; You’re hurting me!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Really?” &nbsp;He immediately put her down on the ground. &nbsp;“Where does it hurt?&nbsp; Is it bad?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“No, it’s okay.&nbsp; It’s just that my belly feels a bit stretched out,” said A-Jiao.&nbsp; She looked at him with a bright red face. &nbsp;“Honey, I want you to carry me.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Can do!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai squatted in front of A-Jiao and let her climb onto his back.&nbsp; He then got up and walked in the direction of the police sub-bureau.&nbsp; In Jiang Zhengkai’s heart, the memories of Su Jing were quickly fading.&nbsp; From now on, A-Jiao would replace Su Jing as the most important person in Jiang Zhengkai’s life.</p>
