 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 51: A-Tao's Rage</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>By the time A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai left the art studio wrapped in each other’s embrace, it was already completely dark outside. &nbsp;They rejoiced in the fact that A-Jiao did not have to teach any students that night, which meant nothing would get in the way of their quality time together. &nbsp;The two of them slowly walked back to A-Jiao’s old house. &nbsp;A-Jiao pressed her body snugly against Jiang Zhengkai’s, while his arm tightly held her shoulder. &nbsp;It was as if both of them were afraid that the other would pull back and leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao, why did you have to go to Tibet?” Jiang Zhengkai quietly asked her as they were walking down the road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could you call me Ziyuan?” &nbsp;A-Jiao raised her head from his chest and looked longingly at him. &nbsp;“I like it better when you call me Ziyuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded. &nbsp;He knew A-Jiao wanted to use this new persona to help him forget the old one, and he was more than willing to oblige her. &nbsp;“Ziyuan, why did you have to go to Tibet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because I was stupid, I guess!” A-Jiao said in a witty reply. &nbsp;“Back then, I thought you didn’t want me, that you thought I was unclean. &nbsp;That’s why I went into hiding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why did you come back? &nbsp;Why didn’t you hide forever?” &nbsp;As he spoke, he pulled A-Jiao back into his embrace and held her tightly. &nbsp;“Was it because you missed me? &nbsp;You couldn’t let me go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You? &nbsp;Dream on!” A-Jiao replied with pouted mouth while still in his embrace. &nbsp;“I had to come back for my check up. &nbsp;I was afraid Old Lady Wang would be concerned for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” &nbsp;Looking at A-Jiao’s expression, Jiang Zhengkai couldn’t help but laugh out loud. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>This really was a stubborn girl!</span></i><span style> &nbsp;“When’s your next check-up then?” he asked as he stared into her eyes. &nbsp;In his opinion, A-Jiao’s jet-black eyes were the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. &nbsp;It was as if they sparkled with the brightness of a million stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm… tomorrow. &nbsp;Do you want to go with me?” &nbsp;She placed her head back on Jiang Zhengkai’s chest. &nbsp;She very much enjoyed leaning into his embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Jiang Zhengkai answered crisply. &nbsp;“We’ll show Old Lady Wang that we’re not afraid of her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! &nbsp;You promised!” A-Jiao sweetly answered as she raise her head, revealing a face full of joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still haven’t answered my question. &nbsp;If you don’t answer me here, I’ll have to send you to an interrogation room.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai gently squeezed A-Jiao’s nose as he continued to press her about going to Tibet. &nbsp;What he really wanted to know was whether she had had any other reasons for going to Tibet. &nbsp;He knew that based on her current mood, she was willing to tell him just about anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No reason, really,” A-Jiao shook her head, before placing it back onto his chest. &nbsp;“At that time, I thought you would never like me. &nbsp;I was a little too sentimental, so I decided to find a place far away where I could hide and recover.” &nbsp;At this point, A-Jiao paused and once again raised her head. &nbsp;“Brother Jiang, did you know that when I was in Shigatse, I stayed at a temple for twenty-one days? &nbsp;Everyday, I meditated, prayed to Buddha, ate a vegetarian diet, and listened to the sutras.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you really are something! &nbsp;You could understand what those lamas were chanting?” &nbsp;&nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai smiled as he looked upon the woman in his arms. &nbsp;He knew that even if a person didn’t understand the holy texts being chanted, simply being in that kind of an environment was enough to purify her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope!” &nbsp;Sure enough, A-Jiao shook her head. &nbsp;Then she smiled and said, “It’s not like I was looking to be ordained as a Buddhist nun. &nbsp;Plus, my heart still desired you, so I had no way of achieving enlightenment, hehe!” &nbsp;She cutely bat her eyelashes as she looked at Jiang Zhengkai’s face. &nbsp;“Brother Jiang… I want to… I want to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to what?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai thought she was especially cute when she had that embarrassed look on her face. &nbsp;To him, the old A-Jiao was like a girl whose skin was thicker than the walls of the Forbidden City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to call you honey...” A-Jiao blurted out, but she avoided eye contact with Jiang Zhengkai and placed her head right back onto his chest again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey...” &nbsp;Hearing A-Jiao calling him that left Jiang Zhengkai a bit stupefied. &nbsp;Well, now that they were officially dating, she could call him that! &nbsp;But could he call her “honey” back? &nbsp;Five years ago, that term of endearment had belonged to another woman who had also deeply loved him. &nbsp;Would he be able to accept using that term for someone else now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Jiang… you…” &nbsp;A-Jiao could feel that something was on Jiang Zhengkai’s mind, so she raised her head and looked intently at his face, her eyes full of concern and worry. &nbsp;Hearing her calls, he snapped out of his stupor and once again pulled A-Jiao into his embrace. &nbsp;“Well… I used to be married, so you can call me ‘honey,’ but can I continue to call you Ziyuan for the time being?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, that’s fine,” A-Jiao crisply agreed. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai felt the woman in his embrace hugging him even tighter than before. &nbsp;“As long as you’re happy, as long as you’re with me, you can call me whatever you want!” she murmured in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Ziyuan!” &nbsp;As he spoke, tears had already welled up in his eyes, but he tried his best to keep them from flowing down onto his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you thanking me?” A-Jiao asked as she happily left his embrace. &nbsp;“Honey! &nbsp;Honey! &nbsp;Honey!” she joyfully yelled at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;Seeing no reaction, she pouted her lips again and asked, “Why aren’t you responding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, hehe, I’m here!” Jiang Zhengkai helplessly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excellent! &nbsp;Hehe. &nbsp;I must be the happiest woman in the whole world!” &nbsp;She once again entered Jiang Zhengkai’s embrace. &nbsp;It appears that when a person is excessively happy, she becomes completely uninhibited in her actions. &nbsp;Could the two of them not get a room and make their public displays of affection less public?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Around the corner, a well-built young man hid behind a building and silently observed Jiang Zhengkai and A-Jiao. &nbsp;He had followed them all the way from the preschool, but he seemed to be satisfied by what he saw now. &nbsp;He quickly turned around and disappeared into the night. &nbsp;The only thing that gave him away were his special forces combat boots. &nbsp;He was A-Meng, the man A-Tao had assigned to protect A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re back early,” A-Tao remarked when A-Meng walked in, sitting at the front desk of his internet cafe looking bored. &nbsp;“Did A-Jiao go back home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” A-Meng replied. &nbsp;He looked all around him before continuing in a whisper, “A-Jiao’s with a pig right now, so… so that’s why I came back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;A pig?” exclaimed A-Tao as he raised his head and looked at A-Meng with slanted eyes. &nbsp;“Are you saying A-Jiao’s with a pig right now? &nbsp;Which one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one named Jiang,” A-Meng truthfully replied. &nbsp;“The two of them looked pretty touchy-feely, so I--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao’s with that Jiang guy?” asked A-Tao as he jumped out of his seat behind the counter. &nbsp;His hands shot out and forcefully grabbed A-Meng’s collar, lifting him straight off the ground. &nbsp;“Say it again!” yelled A-Tao as the veins in his neck started popping. &nbsp;He cracked his neck left and right before asking again, “Who is A-Jiao with again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That pig named Jiang!” &nbsp;A-Meng grabbed onto the counter with all his strength and forced the words out from behind gritted teeth. &nbsp;Under A-Tao’s tight grip, A-Meng had become flush in the face and was noticeably short of breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherfucker! &nbsp;How dare he touch my little sister!” cursed A-Tao as he released his grip on A-Meng’s collar. &nbsp;He leaned his body slightly backwards and then viciously kicked the counter. &nbsp;If A-Meng hadn’t been holding onto the counter from the other side, A-Tao’s kick would’ve knocked it over despite its considerable heaviness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing commotion at the internet cafe’s front entrance, the guests turned their heads one after another to look at what was going on. &nbsp;“What the fuck are you looking at, you motherfuckers?” A-Tao angrily yelled at his customers. &nbsp;“I’ll beat the shit out of anyone who keeps looking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As A-Tao’s yells filled the air, the atmosphere in the internet cafe suddenly became tense. &nbsp;The guests shuddered in fear and quietly returned their attention to their computer monitors. &nbsp;Everyone who frequented this internet cafe had some idea about A-Tao’s background. &nbsp;Even though they didn’t know A-Tao was the infamous “Bald Wolf,” they nevertheless knew A-Tao was a gang leader that shouldn’t be trifled with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tomorrow! &nbsp;Go and find A-Jiao tomorrow!” A-Tao ordered as he pointed his shaking finger at A-Meng. &nbsp;“I want to ask that pig of hers just what exactly he’s up to!” &nbsp;With that, he got up and left the internet cafe. &nbsp;“Fuck, I need some air to cool down!”</span></p>
