 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 43: A-Meng the Bodyguard</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“You really okay?” Jiang Zhengkai turned around and asked Li Hongbin once the other two police officers had left. &nbsp;“Do you want me to take you to the hospital?” &nbsp;Even though he had helped cover for A-Jiao and A-Meng when they were being questioned by the police, he himself was still a police officer as well. &nbsp;What he did today went against his duties as a police officer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, thank you!” Li Hongbin quickly answered while clutching his cheek. &nbsp;“I can drive myself!” &nbsp;He limped his way over to his BMW and drove off. &nbsp;This version of Li Hongbin displayed none of the playboy spirit that the pre-beatdown Li Hongbin had shown when he was harassing A-Jiao. &nbsp;Unfortunately for him, he hadn’t even been able to cop a feel from her before the beating began.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Li Hongbin left, Jiang Zhengkai looked at A-Jiao and A-Meng. &nbsp;Before he could even open his mouth, A-Jiao stood in between him and A-Meng, batted her charming eyelashes, and said, “Thank you, Brother Jiang! &nbsp;Thank you for helping us out back there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about it.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai shook his head but also carefully looked over A-Meng. &nbsp;This was an unusually aggressive young man, and his close combat skills were nearly equal to that of the Bald Wolf. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai felt his heart skip a beat at the thought. &nbsp;Why did he suddenly think of the Bald Wolf? &nbsp;Then he realized it was because he noticed the combat boots on A-Meng’s feet. &nbsp;That type of combat boots was issued exclusively to member of the Chinese special forces. &nbsp;It appeared that this man, just like the Bald Wolf, was a veteran of the People’s Liberation Army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Brother Jiang.” &nbsp;Although A-Meng was aggressive, he wasn’t rude. &nbsp;Otherwise, A-Tao wouldn’t have sent him to secretly protect A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe we’ve met before.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai focused on A-Meng’s face and then asked with a grin, “The other day at the police cemetery, it was you who accompanied Miss Ren, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, that’s right!” A-Jiao stepped in and vigorously nodded her head, clearly not wanting A-Meng to say too much. &nbsp;She didn’t want him to slip up and reveal to Jiang Zhengkai her true identity. &nbsp;“Brother Jiang here is a task force captain! &nbsp;What do you think, pretty cool, huh?” &nbsp;As A-Jiao spoke, she looked at A-Meng with a seemingly proud expression, but she also signalled with her eyes that he shouldn’t do anything brash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, very cool!” A-Meng caught A-Jiao’s signal and immediately continued the conversation along her line of thought. &nbsp;“So… are you going back home now… little sister?” &nbsp;A-Meng was used to calling A-Jiao “A-Jiao” or “Sister Jiao,” but he was an extremely sharp individual. &nbsp;Since Jiang Zhengkai had called A-Jiao “Miss Ren,” he had a hunch that calling her “A-Jiao” might not be a smart move. &nbsp;The familiar words were literally on the tip of his tongue, and yet he still caught himself and said something else. &nbsp;If one were speaking strictly of age, it was true that A-Meng really was probably a few years older than her. &nbsp;However, since it was A-Tao who always addressed A-Jiao as his “little sister,” everyone else normally called her “Sister Jiao” or “big sister” out of deference to A-Tao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet, Brother Meng. &nbsp;I want to hang out for a bit while longer, so why don’t you go back first? &nbsp;Brother Jiang can send me back home later.” &nbsp;A-Jiao cocked her head and put her hands behind her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then! &nbsp;You guys go on ahead, I’ll head back now,” said A-Meng. &nbsp;Before Jiang Zhengkai and A-Jiao even had a chance to respond, A-Meng already took off running.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shall we, Brother Jiang?” &nbsp;After A-Meng had left, A-Jiao immediately returned to her refined persona. &nbsp;Her face was slightly red as she carefully looked at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, okay,” Jiang Zhengkai replied. &nbsp;His head was spinning right now. &nbsp;This A-Meng fellow’s martial arts technique was on par with that of the Bald Wolf. &nbsp;What was his relationship with the Bald Wolf? &nbsp;He’d also gone with Ren Ziyuan to the cemetery, so did he also have a connection with that burnt corpse? &nbsp;As a career police officer, Jiang Zhengkai couldn’t help but think of these questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you thinking about? &nbsp;Let’s go already!” A-Jiao said as she gently placed her hand on Jiang Zhengkai’s shoulder. &nbsp;Even before A-Jiao became a prostitute, she hadn’t been a shy girl. &nbsp;She was willing to do whatever was necessary on her part in pursuing her happiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Miss Ren…” Jiang Zhengkai wasn’t as emotionally liberal as A-Jiao. &nbsp;Inside his heart was only A-Jiao, not Ren Ziyuan, and right now he could only perceive the A-Jiao standing before him as that young woman named Ren Ziyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! &nbsp;You don’t want me to touch you, huh?” &nbsp;Seeing Jiang Zhengkai’s facial expression, A-Jiao said in feigned anger, “You’d let me touch you if I were A-Jiao, right?” &nbsp;Actually, she couldn’t describe in words how happy she was to see him like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, yeah.” &nbsp;When it came to love, Jiang Zhengkai was direct and had a one-track mind. &nbsp;One couldn’t believe that he would actually respond affirmatively to A-Jiao’s question. &nbsp;If Ren Ziyuan weren’t A-Jiao, she would be very jealous or angry right now. &nbsp;Despite all of his years as a detective, however, he still didn’t have a clue about women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine! &nbsp;Fine! &nbsp;I’m just a rebound,” complained A-Jiao as she removed her hand from his arm. &nbsp;“Brother Jiang, could you tell me more about that special person in your heart, A-Jiao?” &nbsp;Her face was full of expectation as she asked that question. &nbsp;Women are curious creatures, especially when it comes to their love rivals, even if that rival was herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well…” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai’s face displayed a slight hint of embarrassment. &nbsp;Even though he loved A-Jiao, to admit to another woman that A-Jiao was a prostitute was simply something that he could not bring himself to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, are you uncomfortable talking about her?” &nbsp;Seeing Jiang Zhengkai’s expression, she was somewhat disappointed. &nbsp;She knew he must have thought her profession was too unseemly to be discussed in polite conversation, but what could she do about that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t we talk about you instead?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai saw the disappointment in A-Jiao’s eyes, but he didn’t correctly guess why. &nbsp;He thought Ren Ziyuan was mad at him because he didn’t want to share A-Jiao’s story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is there to talk about?” A-Jiao lowered her head and answered with pursed lips. &nbsp;“I studied art in college, but dropped out after two years. &nbsp;When it came time to graduate, I spent some money and bought a degree online. &nbsp;Then I became a preschool teacher.” &nbsp;Even though she spoke quite softly, Jiang Zhengkai was still able to hear her clearly. &nbsp;But that sharp brain of his didn’t think to ask her what she was doing during those two years after she dropped out of college and before she became a preschool teacher. &nbsp;He’d only asked her to tell him about herself because he didn’t want to talk about A-Jiao. &nbsp;In his eyes, the woman in front of him was Ren Ziyuan, not A-Jiao. &nbsp;What did it matter to him that Ren Ziyuan dropped out of college after two years?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I’ve heard you are really good at drawing!” Jiang Zhengkai continued on with this subject. &nbsp;Ren Ziyuan teaches art and studied art, so she must know how to draw, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, I’m not too bad.” &nbsp;Apparently, Jiang Zhengkai’s comment on her drawing skills worked in cheering her up. &nbsp;Art was in fact something she could show off for him. &nbsp;She ran right in front of him, grabbed his arm, and asked, “You want to come see my art studio someday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” Jiang Zhengkai eagerly replied. &nbsp;“I’ve always admired artists, and I love the art of painting.” &nbsp;What he said was true. &nbsp;He very much respected his colleagues in the material evidence section who were able to sketch out a suspect’s portrait based only on the descriptions of eyewitnesses. &nbsp;However, this wasn’t the only reason why Jiang Zhengkai carried on this conversation. &nbsp;He saw that A-Jiao was in a much better mood, and he knew that when people were in a good mood, they tended to lower their guard. &nbsp;So it was now that he popped the real question that he wanted to ask. &nbsp;“You and A-Meng seem to know one another very well. &nbsp;He used to be a soldier, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, kind of. &nbsp;We met at the internet cafe,” A-Jiao blurted out. &nbsp;“He did used to be a soldier. &nbsp;I heard he was in the special forces. &nbsp;When he was in the army, he even had a codename. &nbsp;I think it was Raptor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Jiang Zhengkai purposely feigned surprise. &nbsp;“I saw his moves when he was beating that man just now. &nbsp;He learned all of that in the army, huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know? &nbsp;I’ve never been a soldier,” A-Jiao said as she playfully walked on the curb. &nbsp;A woman will almost always show a man she loves her childish side, but it was precisely during these moments that a woman’s defenses against a man were at their weakest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then have you heard of a man called the Bald Wolf before? &nbsp;They say he was also ex-special forces. &nbsp;A real tough guy,” Jiang Zhengkai purposely said in a very casual manner. &nbsp;He wanted to observe A-Jiao’s reaction, and she did not disappoint! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After A-Jiao heard what he said, she was momentarily stunned. &nbsp;However, she very quickly regained her composure and said, “Never heard of him. &nbsp;Do you know him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though A-Jiao verbally denied knowledge of the Bald Wolf, her knees belied her true thoughts. &nbsp;She immediately lost balance walking on the curb, and she fell silent as well. &nbsp;It was obvious she’d realized something, which is why she was readjusting her mentality to conceal what she knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao’s sudden change in behavior did not go unnoticed by Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He now had a reason to continue seeing Ren Ziyuan: she must have a lead on the Bald Wolf. &nbsp;Therefore, the path to apprehending the Bald Wolf began with this woman.</span></p>
