 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 17: A Special Date</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>When there is something weighing on a person’s mind, time really seems to slow down. &nbsp;Being mad at each other, neither of them wanted to speak to the other. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai lay down on the guest bed reading his case file documents, but every so often, he would sneak a peek in A-Jiao’s direction. &nbsp;He had hoped A-Jiao would turn around, but alas, she did not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the clock struck eight, A-Jiao finally spoke up, not being able to bear the silence any longer. &nbsp;She once again laboriously sat up on the hospital bed, looked at Jiang Zhengkai, and angrily said, “Hey, Officer Jiang, I’m hungry! &nbsp;I want something to eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai knew this round went to him. &nbsp;He didn’t say anything, but struggled to contain his smile. &nbsp;He feigned disdain as he glanced at A-Jiao, before lowering his head once again to read his documents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at me!” &nbsp;A-Jiao furiously threw her pillow at Jiang Zhengkai. “Officer Jiang! &nbsp;You’re going to be in a world of hurt if you starve me to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry,” Jiang Zhengkai coolly replied. “But I’m not on duty right now, so I can’t be held responsible if you starve to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine.” &nbsp;A-Jiao swiftly leaned back into her bed. However, because there was no longer a pillow to cushion her, her head smacked right into the hardwood headboard. &nbsp;Immediately, two streams of tears flowed silently down her face. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Men who say they care about me are all liars!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you hurt yourself?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai heard A-Jiao’s head smacking loudly into the headboard. &nbsp;Since he really did care about A-Jiao, he put down the documents he was holding and sat on A-Jiao’s bedside again. &nbsp;She had her back to him, trying very hard to hold back her tears as she shook her head. &nbsp;“I guess not then,” Jiang Zhengkai said as he leaned his head over to look at her face. “Hey, don’t cry now. &nbsp;You’re a big girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like crying, ok? &nbsp;And I’m not a girl! &nbsp;I’m a prostitute!” A-Jiao retorted as her tears started flowing once again. &nbsp;She wiped her face with her hand and said between sobs, “I’ll stop crying if you buy me dinner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Done!” Jiang Zhengkai crisply agreed. “How about hot pot?” &nbsp;Perhaps he did feel a slight bit of remorse over what had just happened after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, I don’t really have a preference.” &nbsp;A-Jiao tried to get up again, but felt like she didn’t have any more strength left. &nbsp;Still, she gritted her teeth and got up anyways. &nbsp;“But you have to carry me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you’re going to have to pay my service fee. &nbsp;Five yuan a step.” &nbsp;With a mischievous smile, Jiang Zhengkai looked into A-Jiao’s eyes as he extended his hand. “Pay up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so annoying!” A-Jiao exclaimed as she broke into a smile as well. “I don’t have any money, so deal with it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No money? &nbsp;Well, if you don’t have any money, then I guess I’m not going to carry you. &nbsp;What am I, your slave?” Jiang Zhengkai imitated A-Jiao’s tone. “Hurry up and pay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… I… I’ll pay you back with my body when I’m better!” A-Jiao said with a full blush on her cheeks. &nbsp;She lowered her head then, not wanting to look at Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;She had wanted to say, “What kind of a boyfriend are you?” But just as the words were about to leave her mouth, she had realized their mutual professions and decided against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;Is that so?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai replied, more joking than angry. &nbsp;“Then I guess I’ll have to carry you for a while!” &nbsp;He had already grown somewhat accustomed to the way A-Jiao talked. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Whatever, she’s just a prostitute. &nbsp;It’s not like I’m going to marry her, so I’ll just let her be.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I hate you!” A-Jiao said as she extended her arm to Jiang Zhengkai. “Help me out of the bed. &nbsp;I don’t have any strength left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it because you’re hungry?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai carefully examined A-Jiao’s face. &nbsp;She seemed a bit pale but otherwise looked alright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe.” &nbsp;With his assistance, A-Jiao slowly stood up. &nbsp;She tried walking a few steps but felt a large amount of pain in her lower body. &nbsp;Still, in order to have dinner with Jiang Zhengkai, A-Jiao did not let out even a whisper of complaint. &nbsp;She endured the pain and left her hospital room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They found a window table at Hot Pot City and sat down. &nbsp;A waiter soon came by to give both of them a menu. “Mister, Miss, what will you be having today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the sound of “Miss,” A-Jiao immediately whipped her head around from staring out the window to stare at the waiter. &nbsp;However, she did not lose her cool. &nbsp;She was just a bit sensitive to that term, that’s all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao, what do you feel like eating?” &nbsp;From across the table, Jiang Zhengkai saw the discomfort on A-Jiao’s face. He fixed his eyes on her and asked, “What’s going on? &nbsp;Are you not feeling well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, no,” A-Jiao said as she shook her head. &nbsp;“I… I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you want to eat?” &nbsp;Since her expression had returned to normal, Jiang Zhengkai lowered his head and started perusing the menu. &nbsp;“You want to get a plain broth pot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! &nbsp;I want a spicy pot!” &nbsp;A-Jiao cocked her head, reading the menu. &nbsp;“I don’t want to eat any of that bland stuff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You body can’t handle spicy food right now! &nbsp;You’re going to have to go with the plain broth,” Jiang Zhengkai said without a shadow of a doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine… then I want some lamb. &nbsp;Oh, and oysters and tripe, too,” said A-Jiao as she looked up at Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way. &nbsp;The doctor said you can’t eat any beef, lamb, or seafood right now. But I can order some shrimp balls for you. &nbsp;As for meat, you can have some pork. &nbsp;Oh, and I’ll order you some vegetables as well…” Jiang Zhengkai said to himself, completely oblivious to A-Jiao’s current expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not a rabbit! &nbsp;Why would I need so many vegetables? &nbsp;Maybe you were a rabbit in your previous life!” A-Jiao mumbled incoherently to herself as she stared at Jiang Zhengkai with eyes that could kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, fine. &nbsp;What else do you want to eat?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai went ahead and ordered everything he had allowed A-Jiao to eat. &nbsp;After he finished, he raised his head and looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to eat anymore!” A-Jiao replied with a pouty face. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>You won’t let me order anything that I want to eat, so what’s the point of asking me in the first place?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Jiang Zhengkai said to the waiter, “I think that’s it. &nbsp;If we need more food later, I’ll let you know.” &nbsp;After taking the order, the waiter repeated it back to them before leaving to pass it on to the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Jiao, do you know a woman by the name of A-Xiu?” Jiang Zhengkai asked. &nbsp;However, A-Jiao’s attention right now was completely fixated on the night scene outside the window. &nbsp;Her thoughts lingered with the dim light of the street lamps, the red tail-lights on passing cars, and the neon signs of nearby storefronts. &nbsp;Life in the hospital was so dull, and she had been cooped up there for over a month now. &nbsp;But at this moment, everything outside was fresh and new, and if it weren’t for Jiang Zhengkai, she wouldn’t have had the chance to enjoy a night on the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Xiu?” &nbsp;After hearing Jiang Zhengkai’s question, A-Jiao turned away from the window and back to him. &nbsp;She pursed her lips and looked intently at him, obviously diligently searching through her memory for any recollection of this person. &nbsp;“What kind of a woman was this A-Xiu of yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you see for yourself?” replied Jiang Zhengkai as he removed a photograph of A-Xiu from his file folder and handed it to A-Jiao. “Take a look. &nbsp;Do you recognize her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” A-Jiao nodded, “I do. &nbsp;That’s right, her name was A-Xiu, but I called her big sister.” &nbsp;Once she had finished looking at the photograph, she handed it back to Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“Uncle Policeman, you didn’t bring me out to dinner just so you could ask about A-Xiu, did you? &nbsp;Anyway, I think she’s been gone from the alley for a while now. &nbsp;If she’s more your type, I’m more than willing to make an introduction.” &nbsp;She winked at Jiang Zhengkai, her long eyelashes twinkling with sultry desire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t there anything you think about besides sex?” Jiang Zhengkai asked A-Jiao with disdain. “I’m not into interested in any of the women in your alley. &nbsp;That includes you!” &nbsp;He added with special emphasis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re not interested, you’re not interested. &nbsp;Why are you getting all worked up anyway, damn cop?” A-Jiao muttered softly. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai could only see her lips moving, but couldn’t hear what she was saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was that?” Jiang Zhengkai asked her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said, I got it!” &nbsp;A-Jiao glanced at Jiang Zhengkai for a second and then turned her head towards the window once more. &nbsp;“You’re only interested in that flat-as-a-board assistant of yours,” she said, clearly referring to Wei Xin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who I’m interested in is none of your business.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai felt a bit baffled by all this. &nbsp;Why was he discussing his personal life with A-Jiao anyway? &nbsp;Didn’t he come here to ask about A-Xiu? &nbsp;Remembering the main reason why he was here in the first place, he changed the subject back to the case. “A-Jiao, do you know why A-Xiu left the alley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” A-Jiao shook her head as she continued to look outside the window. &nbsp;What Jiang Zhengkai didn’t notice was that a peculiar glimmer flashed in A-Jiao’s eyes. &nbsp;She was clearly hiding something, perhaps something related to A-Xiu after all.</span></p>
