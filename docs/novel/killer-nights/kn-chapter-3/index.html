 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 3: The Industrious A-Jiao</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Time flew by very quickly. &nbsp;In what seemed like a blink of an eye, half a month passed without any breakthroughs whatsoever in the case. &nbsp;Nobody came by the municipal police bureau headquarters, any of the police sub-bureaus, or any of the myriad police stations that dotted the city to report a missing person. &nbsp;As a result, there was no way to ascertain the identity of this dead man who left behind nothing more than a pile of skin and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Likewise, the police were also unable to gather any useful leads from Xiaomei’s side of the case. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai did later find out from A-Jiao that Xiaomei would wire money to her family every month. &nbsp;Her family lived in a place far, far away. &nbsp;Her mother had a serious illness and needed to be frequently hospitalized. &nbsp;Her older brother was still in college and dreamed of becoming a police officer one day. &nbsp;This poor girl was responsible for both her mother’s hospital bills and her brother’s college tuition. &nbsp;Xiaomei had just made the latest wire transfer to her family the day before she had died. &nbsp;When A-Jiao had provided this clue to Jiang Zhengkai, she had implored him to not disclose to the family the fact that Xiaomei had already passed away. &nbsp;She said she wanted that poor family to have just one more month of happiness. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai obliged her request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like that, the case went cold. &nbsp;The two victims didn’t leave behind any credible leads. &nbsp;And ever since an armed robbery occurred in another part of the sub-bureau’s area of responsibility last week, active investigation into this strange homicide had been suspended. &nbsp;As such, things quickly returned to normal in the alley, and the lives of the women who worked there went back on track. &nbsp;After all, it doesn’t matter if you're a prince or a pauper, everyone has to eat. &nbsp;There’s no such thing as a free lunch in this world. &nbsp;In fact, there’s no such thing as a free breakfast or dinner either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao was once again in the alley, swaying back and forth while waiting for clients. &nbsp;She and her sisters dressed as provocatively as ever. &nbsp;It may have seemed like these women had completely forgotten about Xiaomei entirely, but in fact, her death weighed heavily on A-Jiao’s mind. &nbsp;She was taking on many more clients than before, which made many of her sisters start talking about her behind her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look! &nbsp;A-Jiao took on seven or eight clients today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I know! &nbsp;Doesn’t she get tired?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks like she wants to earn as much as she can while she’s still young.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha! &nbsp;Doing it so many times a day; isn’t she afraid it’s gonna rot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, these comments were only ever uttered behind A-Jiao’s back. &nbsp;After all, everybody was out there to turn tricks, so no one could fault her for hustling harder. &nbsp;Besides, A-Jiao’s alpha bitch personality was quite well-known in this alley, so none of her sisters had the audacity to openly provoke her. &nbsp;Even their pimps, A-Shun and A-Tie, knew better than to mess with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On one such night, A-Jiao, A-Hua, and A-Hui were together in the alley. &nbsp;They leaned against the wall, chatting away with one another as they waited for clients. &nbsp;A group of young men far off into the distance walked towards them. &nbsp;“Hey, babe! &nbsp;Wanna play?” one of the men asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” A-Hui was the first to respond. “How do you wanna play? &nbsp;All together or one on one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These young men looked at each other and laughed. &nbsp;They were just a bunch of old friends out for a get-together and may have had a bit too much to drink. &nbsp;They were out to cause a bit of mischief, but they weren’t seriously looking to hire prostitutes. &nbsp;“Let’s get out of here!” another of them said. “I have to go to work early tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Same here! &nbsp;No one here’s actually going to hire a hooker,” a third one added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao particularly disliked the word “hooker”, so she decided to take a swipe at them. &nbsp;“What’s wrong, sweetheart? &nbsp;Ran out of money?” she retorted. “If you ain’t got money, then don’t show your face here in Yanhua Alley! &nbsp;What, you guys think you’ll be able to find a free one-night stand here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who do you think you're talking to?” one of the drunker members of the group angrily demanded. “Let me tell you something. &nbsp;I’ve got plenty of money, and I’m going to fuck the shit out of you tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well if you’ve got money, mister, then come on over,” A-Jiao said with puckered lips. “But just so you know, I do this for a living, so I ain't afraid of getting fucked by you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! &nbsp;Challenge accepted!” &nbsp;This man then walked over to A-Jiao, grabbed her arm, and said, “You’re with me tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Weidong!” the others yelled. “Just let it go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think so! &nbsp;Everyone is getting laid tonight!” the drunkard called Zhang Weidong insisted. “I’m buying tonight, so if you’re not with me, then you’re against me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other three young men stared speechlessly at one another. &nbsp;Since he put it that way, none of them could really leave. &nbsp;But after taking another look, they soon realized that there were only three women available for all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, so who else wants to play with me tonight?” A-Jiao asked flirtatiously. “Two for 180! &nbsp;I’m giving you guys a 10% discount.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I guess I’ll go with Weidong,” said one of the three as he stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, Li Chunhai, you look after Weidong,” said the other two. &nbsp;They took A-Hua and A-Hui and started to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be in such a rush, gentlemen!” A-Jiao said as she focused her eyes on Zhang Weidong. “Since someone’s buying tonight, why don’t you let him pay us first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got it!” said Zhang Weidong. &nbsp;He didn’t hesitate and immediately pulled four hundred yuan out of his pocket and slapped it into A-Jiao’s palm. &nbsp;“Keep the change, sweetheart! &nbsp;I’m going to fuck you to within an inch of your life tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, my good sir!” A-Jiao said in a charming voice. &nbsp;She took two of the hundred-yuan bills and shoved them into her pocket before she handed A-Hua and A-Hui the other two bills. &nbsp;Afterwards, the three women took their respective clients and went inside the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking past the room where Xiaomei had died, A-Jiao shot a quick glance at the door. &nbsp;She felt a coldness emanating from that door, as if a pair of eyes were staring at her with a deadly gaze. &nbsp;However, she quickly calmed herself. &nbsp;After all, she’s not a coward, and Xiaomei isn’t the first sister to have died on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Hua and A-Hui picked two rooms on the second floor. &nbsp;The two of them took their clients inside their respective rooms and disappeared. &nbsp;A-Jiao took her two clients to the third floor, only to find that the room was already occupied. &nbsp;That meant the only unoccupied room in this building was the room where Xiaomei had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don't you know where the hell you’re going?” asked Zhang Weidong. &nbsp;A most lecherous smile spread across his face as he reached out his hand and pinched A-Jiao’s buttocks. &nbsp;“If you can’t find a room, we can do it right here in the hallway, haha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though A-Jiao was relatively thick-skinned, she was still a woman, and Zhang Weidong’s crude comment made her blush involuntarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My my, feeling embarrassed, are we?” taunted Zhang Weidong as he leaned towards A-Jiao’s face with slobbery kisses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re gross!” &nbsp;A-Jiao turned her face and successfully dodged Zhang Weidong’s assault. &nbsp;Luckily for A-Jiao, Zhang Weidong was already drunk, which meant he wasn’t as coordinated as he would have been had he been sober. &nbsp;“Come on, let’s go back downstairs!” &nbsp;A-Jiao grit her teeth and finally decided to bring her two clients into the room where Xiaomei had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she entered the room, A-Jiao felt a ghastly chill wash over her. &nbsp;The skeletons that had once been Xiaomei and her client had long been removed by the police. &nbsp;The bed that was last touched by the two victims was now covered in dust, but under the poor lighting, it didn’t actually look that dirty. &nbsp;Besides, Xiaomei had been a bit of a neat freak. &nbsp;She had just washed these sheets the day she had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alas, A-Jiao had returned to this cursed bed. &nbsp;“Alright, Prince Charming! &nbsp;Let me--” &nbsp;Before A-Jiao could finish, Zhang Weidong pushed her directly onto the bed. &nbsp;Not only that, he also barked orders to Li Chunhai. “Chunhai, help me hold her down! &nbsp;I want her to know who’s boss here.” &nbsp;He then removed A-Jiao’s panties and mounted her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lamp in the room flickered on and off. &nbsp;Under the dim light, two men and a woman unleashed their most primal desires in a business transaction that involved trading money for sex. &nbsp;Even though this most ancient of professions isn’t considered acceptable in most societies, it has nevertheless found a sanctuary in the obscure outskirts of this city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three people in the room let out a continuous stream of grunts and moans. &nbsp;Just as they were heavily engaged in sexual intercourse, a woman’s shrill shriek emanated from the room right above them. &nbsp;The three people in Xiaomei’s room all stopped what they were doing and simultaneously raised their heads towards the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after having been tossed about by both Zhang Weidong and Li Chunhai, A-Jiao was truly exhausted. &nbsp;Even though she felt scared, her physical exhaustion greatly surpassed her concern for her sisters’ safety and her inner fears. &nbsp;Since she saw the two men had stopped physically tormenting her, her powerless body slid down into the bed. &nbsp;She really had been quite tired these past couple of days. &nbsp;Even though she chose to enter this “special” profession of her own volition, she had never truly devoted herself to it. &nbsp;Her recent change in work ethic was entirely because of Xiaomei, the poor woman who had died in that room, and because of that woman’s impoverished family...</span></p>
