 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 29: The Woman in the Ditch</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Liu Na, is Wei Xin in the office?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai had called Wei Xin on her cell phone, but she didn’t pick up, so he’d decided to call her desk phone at the sub-bureau. &nbsp;Her officemate Liu Na was the one who answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, Inspector Jiang,” Liu Na replied over the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. &nbsp;Thank you,” Jiang Zhengkai said as he hung up. &nbsp;“Where the hell could that girl be?” he quietly complained. &nbsp;Wei Xin was normally a very hardworking police officer, so it wasn’t like her to skip out on work without telling anybody. &nbsp;Perhaps she was physically and mentally exhausted from working this case and needed to relax for a bit. &nbsp;In any case, Jiang Zhengkai decided he would go back and re-inspect the crime scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, a young man with a shaved head ran into an internet cafe and yelled at the cafe’s owner, A-Tao, “Brother Tao, there’s a woman in the ditch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddamn it, why the hell are you yelling in broad daylight?” A-Tao snarled back at the boy as he slapped him upside the head. &nbsp;He turned around and shouted, “A-Long, A-Meng, and the rest of you, come with me and check things out!” &nbsp;Four or five more tattooed young men in the internet cafe stood up and followed him outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind the cafe was a dried-up drainage ditch, and inside that ditch was a naked woman. &nbsp;Her body was bound up into a strange shape like a frog. &nbsp;It was clear that she had been dumped here after having experienced an excruciating amount of torment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the fuck did this?” A-Tao cursed at the sight of this woman in the ditch. &nbsp;“I wonder who has balls big enough to fuck around in my neighborhood. &nbsp;Alright, let’s get her out of the ditch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing his order, all the young men that came with him from the cafe went down into the ditch and lifted the woman out of there. &nbsp;A-Tao looked her over. &nbsp;“Any of you recognize her? &nbsp;How come she doesn’t look like any of those girls from the alley?” &nbsp;The others looked at her for a while, but they didn’t recognize her either. &nbsp;“Goddamn it! &nbsp;Does nobody know who this girl is? &nbsp;Maybe we should call over a couple more guys to see if they recognize her.” &nbsp;A-Tao gripped the woman’s face and turned it left and right, when he realized that she was still alive. &nbsp;“She’s still breathing! &nbsp;Tell those guys to hurry up and get over here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, a group of more than twenty young men surrounded the poor woman. &nbsp;They stared at her like they were looking at a piece of art. &nbsp;“Doesn’t anyone recognize her?” A-Tao demanded, impatiently pointing at the woman and cracking his neck. &nbsp;“Fuck’s sake! &nbsp;Nobody at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro…” &nbsp;A man named A-Gui finally stood out from the crowd. “I think… I think she’s a cop…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A cop?” &nbsp;A-Tao crouched down again and gave the woman another doubtful glance. &nbsp;“Goddamn! &nbsp;Times sure are a-changin’! &nbsp;Can’t believe someone managed to fuck up a cop this bad.” &nbsp;He beckoned A-Gui over to where the woman was lying on the ground. &nbsp;“Look at her carefully and tell me if she’s really a pig or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Gui got down on his hands and knees and looked at the woman for a long while. &nbsp;“Yes! &nbsp;She is a cop! &nbsp;I’m sure of it!” he said at last.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherfuck!” A-Tao cursed as he viciously kicked the woman in the stomach. &nbsp;The woman immediately let out a rodent-like screech. &nbsp;There was still a gag stuffed in her mouth, and blood started streaming out around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everybody line up for a gangbang,” A-Tao said as he rubbed his head with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, Brother Tao!” exclaimed A-Meng as he ran up to stop him. &nbsp;A-Meng said in a low voice, “Brother Tao, we can’t just kill a cop like that. &nbsp;Plus, we weren’t the ones who did this to her, so there’s no reason to put ourselves in danger either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True,” A-Tao grudgingly agreed, before quickly turning around. &nbsp;“Then what do you propose we do with her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about… how about we give her a golden shower?” suggested A-Meng. &nbsp;“Afterwards, we’ll just throw her back in the ditch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not a bad idea. &nbsp;You think pretty quick on your feet. &nbsp;I like that,” A-Tao pointed at A-Meng in agreement. &nbsp;He gestured towards a couple of the others. &nbsp;“A-Long and A-Biao, you two go get a couple buckets of raw sewage!” &nbsp;Then he turned back towards the woman. &nbsp;“Right, everybody else, get ready to take a piss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Long was on his way back from collecting dirty dish water from a nearby restaurant when he heard someone calling his name. &nbsp;“What’s the rush, A-Long?” &nbsp;He promptly stopped in his tracks and saw a girl dressed in traditional Tibetan attire staring at him from the entrance of the internet cafe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh! &nbsp;Did the planets align today or something? &nbsp;We just ran into one bitch, and now here comes another,” A-Long said to A-Biao as he pointed at the girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, tell me about it! &nbsp;Maybe we can fuck this one after we’ve given the other one her shower,” replied A-Biao. &nbsp;Obviously, neither of these idiots realized that the girl standing in front of them was A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherfuckers! &nbsp;I’m gone for a few days, and you sons of bitches have already forgotten who the fuck I am?” yelled A-Jiao. &nbsp;She walked up to A-Long and gave him a hard kick in his private parts. &nbsp;Unprepared for such a vicious assault from a woman, A-Long neither leapt out of the way nor blocked the kick. &nbsp;Instead, he let out a soft </span><i><span style>ow </span></i><span style>as he grabbed his crotch and fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember me now, motherfucker?” asked A-Jiao with arms akimbo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye… yeah…” A-Long replied painfully from the ground. &nbsp;“Sister A-Jiao, you… you’re back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is everyone?” A-Jiao asked. &nbsp;She impatiently shook her leg as she fell back into her boss lady persona.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re all out back, ma’am!” A-Biao nervously answered A-Jiao. &nbsp;“This morning, A-Jiang found some woman. &nbsp;So Brother Tao took us all around back to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;A woman? &nbsp;What kind of woman?” A-Jiao asked disdainfully. &nbsp;“Look at you worthless sacks of shit. &nbsp;The only thing you know how to do is push women around, isn’t it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, ma’am. &nbsp;That woman’s a pig,” A-Long replied as he stood up with his hand still cupping his crotch. &nbsp;“That was one hard kick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, did I break it? &nbsp;I’m sorry. &nbsp;Maybe you can swap it out for a rubber dildo. &nbsp;Those last longer than your little thing,” A-Jiao mercilessly teased A-Long. &nbsp;She headed straight for the rear of the internet cafe, never bothering to look back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Tao! &nbsp;What are you guys playing with?” &nbsp;From far away, A-Jiao saw a group of men congregated around a drainage ditch. &nbsp;They were all holding onto their pants for some reason. &nbsp;Among them was the familiar form of a tall, muscular, and bald man: A-Tao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! &nbsp;A-Jiao!” &nbsp;A-Tao recognized A-Jiao’s voice and hurriedly zipped up his pants, before turning around to welcome her with open arms. &nbsp;“Baby girl, I’ve missed you so much. &nbsp;Did you miss me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, you wish!” A-Jiao charmingly teased as she wrapped her arm around A-Tao’s waist. &nbsp;“So Brother Tao, what are you guys playing with? &nbsp;You all seem to be having a lot of fun, yet nobody remembered to invite me to the party?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing. &nbsp;Just some slut!” A-Tao replied as he casually pointed at the woman on the ground. &nbsp;“Don’t worry. &nbsp;She’s not from the alley. &nbsp;This one’s a pig.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A cop?” A-Jiao curiously asked. &nbsp;She leaned in for a closer look of the woman’s face. “...Wei Xin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, you know her?” A-Tao asked A-Jiao with some amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell are you all doing?” yelled A-Jiao as she pushed A-Tao away. &nbsp;“Does it really take all of you men to bully this poor woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I didn’t do anything!” A-Tao tried to explain as he backed away from A-Jiao. &nbsp;“Everyone here is a witness! &nbsp;They can all tell you I didn’t do anything. &nbsp;We were taking a piss, that’s all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then she…” A-Jiao said as she pointed at Wei Xin, “she…” &nbsp;Suddenly, A-Jiao’s face twitched once, as something dawned upon her. &nbsp;She abruptly turned and walking away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiao! &nbsp;What are you doing? &nbsp;You’re not mad at me, are you? &nbsp;I promise not to mess around with a girl like this again!” &nbsp;As A-Jiao stalked off in anger, A-Tao immediately chased after her. &nbsp;“Baby girl, I didn’t know you knew her. &nbsp;You know me, I fucking hate pigs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Throw her back into the ditch,” A-Jiao said through tears. &nbsp;She forced herself to calm down. &nbsp;“And call the police! &nbsp;Don’t tell them I was here, though. &nbsp;Oh, and you might want to save yourselves the trouble of taking a trip down to the police station, so don’t tell them what you were doing just now either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I got it. &nbsp;So where are you going now?” A-Tao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going back to my old house,” A-Jiao replied. &nbsp;“You can find me there if you need me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she walked away, A-Meng came running up. &nbsp;“Brother Tao, I think A-Jiao’s got something on her mind,” A-Meng said softly in his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about her. &nbsp;She’ll be alright,” A-Tao responded as he swept his bald head with his hand. &nbsp;He pointed back towards Wei Xin and ordered, “Throw her back into the ditch! &nbsp;And use the dirty dish water to wash away our… DNA. &nbsp;Then call the police! &nbsp;Make sure she doesn’t die before the police get here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it, Brother Tao! &nbsp;I know what to do,” A-Meng acknowledged as he went to work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old house that A-Jiao had mentioned was an old residential building located right next to the internet cafe. &nbsp;One of the units inside had once belonged to A-Jiao’s maternal grandparents, but it had become A-Jiao’s after they’d passed away, even though the deed was technically still listed under her mother’s name: Lin Yunfang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao sat on the bed and held a big-headed teddy bear. &nbsp;A continuous stream of tears flowed down her face. &nbsp;She wasn’t sad for Wei Xin; rather, seeing her like that reminded of the time when she herself was attacked. &nbsp;The one who’d hurt Wei Xin was clearly the same bastard who had hurt her, although that was not something she wanted to share with A-Tao. &nbsp;Still, she did know that if A-Tao ever found out the truth of what had happened to her, he would most definitely track down that bastard and tear him to a thousand pieces with his bare hands. &nbsp;</span></p>
