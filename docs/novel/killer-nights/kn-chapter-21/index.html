 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 21: The Fifth Murder</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai’s police cruiser rolled quietly out of the Ju’an Estates residential compound. &nbsp;He didn’t notice that behind the floor-to-ceiling windows on the third floor, a young woman stood in silence as she watched him depart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two lines of tears streamed continuously down A-Jiao’s face. &nbsp;She could only stand there quietly as she watched Jiang Zhengkai leave. &nbsp;As a prostitute, she knew her social status placed her at the very bottom of China’s societal hierarchy. &nbsp;She didn’t have the luxury to pursue her own happiness, especially not with a cop who had witnessed her violation. &nbsp;She stood there blankly until nightfall, when she picked up her suitcase and quietly left this home of hers, this familiar city of hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The exchange on the intercom wasn’t some beautiful misunderstanding. &nbsp;Since A-Jiao had already decided to leave, she had pre-recorded several messages on the smart intercom system. &nbsp;They were no more than the traces of a woman whose heart had already left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai’s car arrived in the local police station’s parking lot. &nbsp;He got out of the car and quickly went to Zhang Nan’s office. &nbsp;“Sergeant Zhang, what’s the situation been in the alley the last couple of days?” he eagerly asked Zhang Nan as soon as he saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been rather quiet, actually,” Zhang Nan replied. &nbsp;“The number of women working in the alley is a lot lower than before.” &nbsp;He was right. &nbsp;Prostitutes were human too, and everyone is afraid of dying. &nbsp;Those women were trying to make money, not get themselves killed. &nbsp;Even police officers were told to not unnecessarily risk their lives, so there was even less reason for your average citizen to keep working in the face of imminent danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just as well,” Jiang Zhengkai said as he sat down in front of Zhang Nan’s desk. &nbsp;“The fewer of them there are, the less chance that there’ll be another homicide, which makes reporting to our superiors a bit less difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can say that again!” Zhang Nan nodded. &nbsp;He leaned over and quietly said, “Ever since this string of homicides, our city’s entertainment income has slipped quite a bit.” &nbsp;The two of them had a good laugh at that. &nbsp;Police officers were people, too, and people like to gossip. &nbsp;Police officers who don’t like to gossip only exist in propaganda movies from the 70s and 80s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it’s 8 o’clock. &nbsp;Why don’t we go take a look at the alley?” said Jiang Zhengkai as he looked at his watch. &nbsp;He checked his gear before gesturing for Zhang Nan to leave with him. &nbsp;They were soon accompanied by about a dozen other officers from the district sub-bureau and neighboring local stations who were also on their way to the alley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a windless night. &nbsp;The plain-clothed beat cops patrolled the entire alley before returning to the position where Jiang Zhengkai and Zhang Nan kept watch. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, we looked this entire place over. &nbsp;There are only about seven or eight women working tonight,” one of them reported.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! &nbsp;Closely surveil every one of them. &nbsp;Keep tabs on all of the men who enter this alley,” Jiang Zhengkai replied before dismissing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment, there were very few women in the alley, which meant the number of men coming to the alley was even lower. &nbsp;After all, a man could satisfy his urges with his own hand. &nbsp;The vast majority of Chinese men would much rather live like some porn-addicted Japanese for a few days than risk death for a bit of momentary pleasure. &nbsp;Patriotism didn’t figure much into the equation in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three hours went by, and the only men who appeared in the alley were plain-clothed police officers or local residents. &nbsp;Incredibly, not a single male stranger paid this alley a visit. &nbsp;Just when everyone thought this would turn out to be another quiet night, the wretched scream of a woman once again pierced the air. &nbsp;The sound appeared to have come from the direction of a local resident’s window, but it was gone almost as soon as it had come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on, let’s go! &nbsp;Quickly! &nbsp;Up there!” ordered Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;All of a sudden, at least thirty or forty undercover police officers, both men and women, converged on the building from all parts of the alley. &nbsp;Apparently, all of the officers of the Ju’an Road Police Station had recently been ordered to take turns doing night patrols of the alley, to keep a watchful eye over and ensure the safety of the prostitutes working there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the police were unable to apprehend the killer. &nbsp;The crime scene was familiar by now: no blood splatters, no signs of a struggle, just the skin-covered skeletons of a man and a woman locked in sex on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That bastard is getting more and more brazen!” Zhang Nan bellowed furiously, having just charged into the room and witnessed the scene on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh-huh…” Jiang Zhengkai replied as he emotionlessly gazed at the crime scene. &nbsp;Although there’d been no significant breakthrough in the murder investigations, there was now a striking new development in the kind of victims targeted by the unknown murderer. &nbsp;It appeared that the murderer no longer attacked only prostitutes and johns, but also regular residents of this alley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai carefully examined the skeletons, then checked beneath the victims’ bed, followed by an examination of the same space in the apartment unit immediately above this one. &nbsp;However, his search turned up nothing unusual, and he wasn’t able to acquire any new leads. &nbsp;Furthermore, he did not experience the presence of an icy chill like he had before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, everyone’s dismissed,” Jiang Zhengkai announced. &nbsp;He took one last look at the crime scene before turning to look at Zhang Nan. &nbsp;“Sergeant Zhang, please hand over any documents you have on this household to Wei Xin tomorrow and have her bring them to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir,” Zhang Nan replied, before ordering his subordinates to cordon off the crime scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai descended the stairs to the ground floor, got into his police cruiser, and drove out of the alley. &nbsp;When he passed by Ju’an Estates, he stopped his car and parked outside the compound’s front gate. &nbsp;From here, he had a clear view of A-Jiao’s window. &nbsp;It looked dark inside her condo, clearly a sign that no one was home or that its occupant had already gone to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lit a cigarette inside the car and gazed at the window while he smoked. &nbsp;He didn’t know what he was hoping for. &nbsp;Perhaps he was hoping for a miracle; namely, that the light inside that condo would suddenly turn on, and a young woman would appear in front of that window to smile or wave at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He parked the car there for about ten minutes before he drove away from the compound and back to his home. &nbsp;It was in an ordinary residential community, and he lived in an ordinary two-bedroom apartment. &nbsp;The interior of his home was more or less clean. &nbsp;The only thing uncomfortable about his apartment was the cold temperature inside. &nbsp;Perhaps that was because it was usually empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey, I’m home,” Jiang Zhengkai said quietly as he entered. &nbsp;He didn’t bother turning on the lights. &nbsp;After all these years, he could literally navigate his apartment with his eyes closed. &nbsp;He knew exactly where everything was, which he demonstrated by deftly walking around the apartment’s furnishings in the dark. &nbsp;Besides, the only person who was going to move around the furniture was himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How was your day?” &nbsp;It was still Jiang Zhengkai’s voice in the darkness. &nbsp;Perhaps his wife was already asleep? &nbsp;It was early in the morning after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’m tired. &nbsp;I’ll be going to sleep now. &nbsp;Good night,” said Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He walked inside one of the bedrooms, and before long, there was the sound of rhythmic snoring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, Wei Xin went straight to the Ju’an Road Police Station to retrieve the documents Jiang Zhengkai had wanted, before reporting for work at the sub-bureau. &nbsp;She brought the case file to his office. &nbsp;“Inspector Jiang, may I enter?” &nbsp;She saw him sitting in his chair with brows furrowed and a cigarette in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, hey, come on in, Wei.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai beckoned her to enter as he immediately went about putting out his cigarette. &nbsp;“Hehe, I’ve been a bit stressed out lately, hence the cigarette. &nbsp;I hope the smoke doesn’t bother you too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about it. &nbsp;My dad smokes at home all the time,” Wei Xin said with a smile as she walked into his office. &nbsp;“Here are the documents you requested.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great, thank you. &nbsp;No other discoveries on Sergeant Zhang’s end?” Jiang Zhengkai asked as he grabbed the documents and started to review them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet,” Wei Xin replied shaking her head. &nbsp;“The two victims last night were both ordinary residents in the alley. &nbsp;Neither of them had a criminal record.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Jiang Zhengkai asked, continuing his careful review of the case files. &nbsp;Indeed, the male victim was a middle school teacher, while the female victim was a nurse. &nbsp;It looked like this one was going to be an unsolved mystery as well. &nbsp;He sighed and looked up at Wei Xin again. &nbsp;“What did their neighbors have to say about them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, everyone said the man was kind of dull, but the woman had quite a temper,” Wei Xin recalled. &nbsp;“But all of their neighbors claimed that the two of them had a pretty good relationship, and there wasn’t any altercation last night. &nbsp;They did mention that the man was a bit whipped by his wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then,” Jiang Zhengkai closed the case file and looked at her. &nbsp;“How about this? &nbsp;You go to the school and hospital where the victims worked and gather more information about their work history and interpersonal relationship. &nbsp;See what their colleagues have to say about them. &nbsp;Hopefully that will turn up some useable leads.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it, Inspector Jiang,” Wei Xin acknowledged. &nbsp;She got up and was about to leave the office when she suddenly turned around and said quietly, “Inspector, you do know that smoking is bad for your health.”</span></p>
