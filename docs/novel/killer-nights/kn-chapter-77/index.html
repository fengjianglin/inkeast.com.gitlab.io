 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” Uncle Gao crisply agreed. &nbsp;He had no idea A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai had purposely laid a trap for him. &nbsp;“Most of my buddies on the police force have all retired, but some of their colleagues and subordinates are still around. &nbsp;I think some of them would agree to help me out if I asked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much, Uncle Gao!” said A-Jiao. &nbsp;She took the portrait of A-Xiu from Jiang Zhengkai’s hand and placed it in front of Uncle Gao, then opened it up for him to see. &nbsp;“Uncle Gao, this is what she looks like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I see!” said Uncle Gao as he carefully studied the woman’s expression and facial features in the portrait. &nbsp;His face twitched ever so slightly when he realized who she was. He then shifted his gaze back to A-Jiao and asked, “This is your sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right!” A-Jiao answered surely. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai, seated right next to A-Jiao, was carefully observing Uncle Gao’s facial expression. &nbsp;Although that twitch on Uncle Gao’s face had been very slight and quick, it nevertheless did not escape Jiang Zhengkai’s detection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This woman…” said Uncle Gao before he quickly stopped again. &nbsp;He turned around and looked at the few customers behind him and said, “How about this? &nbsp;I’ll tell you later when all of these customers have left.” &nbsp;He then lowered his voice and continued, “It’s better if there are fewer people around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, sure, sure!” A-Jiao quickly nodded her head. &nbsp;Due to the downpour, her evening class had been canceled, so she had plenty of time. &nbsp;As for Jiang Zhengkai, he decided not to press the issue when he saw that Uncle Gao was willing to talk to them about A-Xiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>About an hour later, the remaining customers in Uncle Cai’s noodle shop gradually left. &nbsp;Outside, the torrential rain continued unabated, so it was unlikely there would be new arrivals. &nbsp;Uncle Cai came out of the kitchen and chatted with A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai for a little bit before he and Auntie Ma left the dining area to continuing work in the kitchen. &nbsp;Clearly, Uncle Gao had already given Uncle Cai some indication that he planned to speak with A-Jiao tonight, so Uncle Cai had agreed to give him some time and space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Uncle Cai and Auntie Ma left, Uncle Gao came over to A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai’s table with a pot of tea and some snacks. &nbsp;“A-Jiao, is this woman really your sister?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Uncle Gao,” A-Jiao answered, just as confidently as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you can stop lying to me now,” laughed Uncle Gao as he peered deeply at her. &nbsp;He then turned around and said to Jiang Zhengkai, “You were the one who came up with the idea for this young lady to ask me about this woman, weren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, yes,” Jiang Zhengkai crisply answered. &nbsp;Uncle Gao had seen through his ruse; there was no further reason to continue with the charade. &nbsp;“Yes, it was my idea, but I wasn’t sure about--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to guess any further!” &nbsp;Uncle Gao interrupted Jiang Zhengkai’s hypothesizing with a wave of his hand. &nbsp;“My name is Gao Jianjun. &nbsp;I used to be the commanding sergeant of a police station not far from here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” asked Jiang Zhengkai in feigned surprise to Uncle Gao’s revelation. &nbsp;After all, he didn’t know what Uncle Gao was about to say, so he didn’t feel it was necessary to show his hand just yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” said Uncle Gao, before turning his head to look at A-Jiao again. &nbsp;He then picked up a cup of tea off of the table and took a sip before saying, “It all started about two years ago. &nbsp;But first, why don’t you tell me who are you are, young man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. &nbsp;My name is Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;I am the captain of the district sub-bureau’s investigative division.” &nbsp;As he spoke, Jiang Zhengkai took out both his personal and police ID and handed them to Uncle Gao. &nbsp;Uncle Gao took a close look at them to confirm his identity, before sliding them back across the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I guess I’ll give you a brief summary of what I know,” said Uncle Gao, reassured that Jiang Zhengkai was who he claimed to be. &nbsp;“I’ve heard about you. &nbsp;Back then, you had just been promoted to lieutenant at the investigative division, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that’s correct!” nodded Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;According to the timeline, he had indeed been promoted to be the investigative division’s lieutenant and second-in-command right around the time Zhang Nan and the others were questioning A-Xiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Around that time, Deputy Commissioner for Vice Zheng Yueshan suddenly called me. &nbsp;Said he had a case that needed my help,” Uncle Gao said slowly as he recalled those events from two years ago. &nbsp;“He said the bureau had found that some of the women in the alley were in league with Sui Dequan’s minions, and that there was a possibility they were dealing drugs. &nbsp;Therefore, he hoped I could help investigate the situation in the alley.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But Commissioner Zheng is in charge of Vice, not Narcotics. &nbsp;So why was in in charge of this investigation?” interrupted Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” chuckled Uncle Gao, “At the time, my deputy Zhang Nan asked the same question! &nbsp;He’s a good lad. &nbsp;Actually, this was all arranged by Commissioner Yao. &nbsp;Sui Dequan was a sly old fox. &nbsp;He would’ve sniffed out the narcs from a mile away, but if we sent in Vice to investigate, then he wouldn’t be as on-guard. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I was not at liberty to share that information with Zhang Nan. &nbsp;That lad probably still remembers this case, doesn’t he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so that’s what happened,” Jiang Zhengkai nodded his head. &nbsp;He then gestured for Uncle Gao to continue with his story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The case progressed relatively well. &nbsp;Very quickly, we found the woman in your portrait. &nbsp;Her name was A-Xiu,” said Uncle Gao as he pointed at her portrait. &nbsp;“But that woman was a tough nut to crack. &nbsp;Her lips were sealed tight.” &nbsp;As he spoke, Uncle Gao's demeanor grew more imposing. &nbsp;"We thought of just about everything at the time, but she simply wouldn't talk. &nbsp;It was right then that something unexpected happened!" &nbsp;At this point, Uncle Gao's gaze shifted to Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;"You know what happened. &nbsp;Sui Dequan's minions just so happened to find Xue Wanchuan's son Xue Zhiyuan when he came back to attend his father's funeral. &nbsp;Then they went ahead and killed him."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You're right, Uncle Gao," Jiang Zhengkai nodded in response when he saw Uncle Gao's attention turning towards him. &nbsp;"I took over that case towards the end. &nbsp;After Xue Zhiyuan's death, Xue Guangliang came back and killed Sui Dequan's entire family. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I wasn't able to catch him."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe, it isn't that easy to catch the Bald Wolf!" Uncle Gao comforted Jiang Zhengkai when he saw a hint of guilt in his eyes. &nbsp;"We hunted him for all those years but still couldn't get him. &nbsp;You're still young. &nbsp;You'll get another shot at him." &nbsp;As the two exchanged words, both of them seemed to forget about the woman sitting besides them. &nbsp;In Jiang Zhengkai’s case, it was quite the oversight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's true, Uncle Gao!" Jiang Zhengkai nodded in agreement. &nbsp;"I will do everything in my power to catch him. &nbsp;I have to, in order to avenge all of our comrades who died at his hand."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hehe! &nbsp;I believe in you, young man," Uncle Gao responded in a carefree fashion. &nbsp;"I believe that those who have died will rest in peace having heard what you just said!" &nbsp;At this point, Uncle Gao shifted the topic of conversation back to A-Xiu. &nbsp;"Sui Dequan's death was a huge blow to his entire crime organization. &nbsp;While you were pursuing Xue Guangliang, we intensified the crackdown on the Sui crime family. &nbsp;Many of his top lieutenants either were killed, were captured, or fled. &nbsp;As a result, the flow of drugs to the women in the alley stopped, and since A-Xiu would rather die than confess, we had to put the case back on ice."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Were you not able to find any conclusive evidence?" Jiang Zhengkai asked further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Conclusive evidence? &nbsp;No," Uncle Gao shook his head. &nbsp;"That woman A-Xiu was wicked clever. &nbsp;Every time after she took a shipment of drugs from Sui Dequan, she would immediately divide the drugs up into small packages and distribute them to her fellow prostitutes in the alley. &nbsp;We tried several times to arrest her for possession, but came up empty every time," he sighed. &nbsp;"Also, she varied the locations of her drug deals. &nbsp;And due to her special profession, she had no long-term partner either, so that was another dead end. &nbsp;At the end of the day, we didn't have sufficient evidence to provide probable cause for her continued detention."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then do you know where she went after she was released?" asked Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not sure," Uncle Gao shook his head. &nbsp;"I was transferred shortly after A-Xiu's release. &nbsp;That was just before I decided to retire, and let you younger guys take over."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then, have you heard any information related to A-Xiu since then?" persisted Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I heard bits and pieces," Uncle Gao endeavored to recall. &nbsp;"I heard she disappeared from the alley shortly after she was released. &nbsp;I also heard from a colleague that was working the case after I left that she and Sui Dequan had a dispute over payment for the last shipment of drugs, and she disappeared shortly thereafter."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai nodded gratefully as Uncle Gao finished speaking. &nbsp;He knew the retired cop had told him everything he knew and that this was all the help he was going to get from the old man.</span></p>
