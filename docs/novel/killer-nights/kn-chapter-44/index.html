 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 44: The Rookie Cop</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai saw that A-Jiao didn’t want to talk about the Bald Wolf, so he quickly changed the subject. &nbsp;Soon, her frayed nerves had calmed, and the two of them talked and laughed again as they walked for a while. &nbsp;Suddenly, A-Jiao stopped dead in her tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Brother Jiang, where are you taking me?” she wittily asked Jiang Zhengkai with her hands behind her back, looking around at their unfamiliar surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Taking you...?” Jiang Zhengkai stammered, looking left and right. &nbsp;“I was following you!” &nbsp;He also had a baffled expression on his face. &nbsp;Clearly, the two of them were so engrossed in their conversation that they’d inadvertently taken a wrong turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I don’t care! &nbsp;You still need to bring me home,” said A-Jiao as she inched her body closer to Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;The elegant smell of the fragrance on her body immediately filled his nostrils. &nbsp;Even though Jiang Zhengkai was a man with a great sense of self-control, he was still a man. &nbsp;When a woman who looked nearly identical to the woman he longed for actively threw herself at him, he was hard-pressed to reject such temptation. &nbsp;Add to that the fact that it was the dead of night, and that this woman gave off a most scintillating scent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai unconsciously wrapped his arms around A-Jiao as he locked her in his embrace. &nbsp;She made no move to resist him, since this was precisely what she was hoping for. &nbsp;A-Jiao buried her face in Jiang Zhengkai’s chest and murmured, “Brother Jiang, can you love me and not A-Jiao, please?” &nbsp;As she spoke, a pair of glistening teardrops dropped to her cheeks. &nbsp;That was her heartfelt wish, for Jiang Zhengkai to fall in love with the Ren Ziyuan of the present and forget about the A-Jiao of the past. &nbsp;She didn’t want the man she loved to forever bear the burden of having a prostitute for a lover, for to love someone is to shield him from pain and suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai didn’t respond to A-Jiao’s pleas. &nbsp;He couldn’t respond to them. &nbsp;He couldn’t not love A-Jiao, just like he couldn’t love Ren Ziyuan. &nbsp;He wasn’t a fickle man. &nbsp;Whether it was towards the deceased Su Jing or the missing A-Jiao, his love would always be sincere, earnest, and persistent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao wasn’t able to elicit a response from Jiang Zhengkai, but so what? &nbsp;The man embracing her would sooner or later be hers. &nbsp;She just didn’t want him to belong to her past self. &nbsp;A-Jiao put her ear to his chest. &nbsp;She rather liked hearing this man’s strong and powerful heartbeat. &nbsp;For some reason, it gave her a sense of security. &nbsp;The two of them stood in mutual embrace for several minutes more. &nbsp;Eventually, it was Jiang Zhengkai who finally broke the silence. &nbsp;“Miss Ren, I… you know I love A-Jiao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… promise me… before A-Jiao returns, could you think of me as her?” &nbsp;Her words were already laced with sobs. &nbsp;She didn’t know why she wanted to cry, just that she wanted to. &nbsp;Should she be happy instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” Jiang Zhengkai still wanted to say something, but when he looked into A-Jiao’s tearful eyes, he swallowed whatever words he had originally planned on saying. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao bit her lips and held in her sobs as she said with her nose twitching, “Brother Jiang, I love you! &nbsp;Just think of me as A-Jiao… I beg of you… as soon as she returns, I’ll leave.” &nbsp;The moment she finished, she collapsed in his embrace and cried uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… ai! &nbsp;Okay… fine.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai caressed A-Jiao several times as he continued to hold her in his embrace. &nbsp;He felt he had developed a new sense of fondness for this woman wrapped in his arms, but that wasn’t enough to change his heart. &nbsp;But it’s better to have something to believe in than nothing at all, right? &nbsp;So in the end, he decided to accept A-Jiao’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them stood there, silently holding each other. &nbsp;The man embraced the woman in his arms, while the woman placed her head on the man’s chest. &nbsp;The two didn’t care about the pedestrians who walked past them on the street or the drivers who peered through their car windows. &nbsp;Right now, the whole world belonged to just those two. &nbsp;The only question was, were their hearts filled more with happiness or sorrow?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, Jiang Zhengkai arrived on-time at the office. &nbsp;By the time he’d dropped A-Jiao off at her home, it was already late into the night, but that didn’t bother him at all. &nbsp;For a dedicated police officer such as Jiang Zhengkai, staying up late was all in a day’s work, so he didn’t really feel any different than any other day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, Commander Wu assigned you a new assistant,” Liu Na said as she led a young man to the entrance of Jiang Zhengkai’s office. &nbsp;“A fresh graduate from the police academy, Lu Xiaoqiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoqiang, is it?” said Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;He felt as if something was amiss, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. &nbsp;He was apparently not very well-versed in Stephen Chow’s comedy movies. &nbsp;(Translator’s Note: “Xiaoqiang” is a Chinese nickname for cockroach due to a “pet” cockroach kept by actor Stephen Chow’s character Tang Bohu in the popular comedy film </span><i><span style>Flirting Scholar</span></i><span style>.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good morning, Inspector Jiang!” shouted Lu Xiaoqiang as he saluted Jiang Zhengkai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, just come in already,” Jiang Zhengkai called for Lu Xiaoqiang to enter as he motioned for Liu Na to return to her desk. &nbsp;“Liu Xiaoqiang...” Jiang Zhengkai said to himself as he rifled through the young man’s personnel file. &nbsp;He casually asked, “Oh, I see you’re Sichuanese. &nbsp;Are there a lot of people with the last name ‘Lu’ where you’re from?” &nbsp;He raised his head and carefully studied Lu Xiaoqiang’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir,” Lu Xiaoqiang crisply answered. &nbsp;“The Lu Clan is a major clan in my hometown.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see!” Jiang Zhengkai nodded in response. &nbsp;“From your file, I can see that you obtained high marks at the academy. &nbsp;Why didn’t you choose an assignment in Beijing? &nbsp;Why did you choose to be assigned here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, I--”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Lu Xiaoqiang could finish, Jiang Zhengkai impatiently waved his hand and threw his &nbsp;personnel file down onto his desk, “Enough with the sirs already! &nbsp;Stand at ease! &nbsp;This isn’t the academy, so stop wasting your energy on maintaining perfect military bearing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, yes, Inspector Jiang,” Lu Xiaoqiang eagerly nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please, take a seat for crying out loud. &nbsp;Stop standing there like a stiff,” admonished Jiang Zhengkai as he took out a cigarette. &nbsp;He tossed it over to Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“Do you smoke? &nbsp;Now, dispense with the pleasantries and tell me something real about yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector.” &nbsp;Lu Xiaoqiang scratched his head and sat down across from Jiang Zhengkai. &nbsp;“I have a younger sister who works in this city. &nbsp;I came here mainly so I can take care of her. &nbsp;When I was in school, all of my family’s expenses, including my tuition, were paid for by my sister. &nbsp;I know she’s sacrificed a lot for my family, for me.” &nbsp;As he spoke, Lu Xiaoqiang couldn’t help but get teary-eyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Jiang Zhengkai glanced at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“You have a good sister!” &nbsp;He sighed, then asked, “What does she do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard she works at the front desk of a hotel here…” Lu Xiaoqiang answered with some hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You heard?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai was noticeably displeased by Lu Xiaoqiang’s answer. &nbsp;“What kind of a big brother are you? &nbsp;How do you not even know where your little sister works? &nbsp;When did you get here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last night,” Lu Xiaoqiang replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to give you three days leave. &nbsp;Go find your sister and spend some time with her.” Jiang Zhengkai looked at Lu Xiaoqiang and said with no trace of hesitation, “Three days later, I want you here in my office at 0830 in the morning sharp, and I want you to be prepared to give your 100%, understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir!” Lu Xiaoqiang boomed; he stood at attention out of habit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did I just tell you? &nbsp;For the last time, this isn’t the academy!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai couldn’t help but chuckle as he looked at Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;Every veteran cop started out as a rookie. &nbsp;Thinking back, he probably knew less than this kid when he first graduated from the academy. &nbsp;“Hey, how are you going to find your sister in this huge city of ours if you don’t have your sister’s address?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I have a point of contact,” said Lu Xiaoqiang as he pulled out an envelope from his pocket and respectfully handed it over. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai took the envelope and glanced at the address. &nbsp;He was stunned by what he saw. &nbsp;The From line on the envelope clearly said, “Lu Xiaomei C/O Zhu Yuping.” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai rubbed his nose with his finger and expressionlessly returned the envelope back to Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“Xiaoqiang, I just remembered something! &nbsp;I’ll need to delay your leave for a bit. &nbsp;There’s a meeting at Bureau HQ today, but my schedule is already jam-packed. &nbsp;Could you go in my stead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir! &nbsp;I will complete the mission as instructed!” Lu Xiaoqiang seriously replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There you go again!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai smiled as he pointed at Lu Xiaoqiang, except this time his smile was very much forced. &nbsp;“Go now! &nbsp;Make sure to give a detailed report of the meeting when you return in the afternoon,” he ordered before waving Lu Xiaoqiang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir!” Lu Xiaoqiang replied with the same zealousness as before. &nbsp;It appeared that he still wasn’t able to fully adjust to post-academy life. &nbsp;Afterwards, he scurried away towards municipal bureau headquarters.</span></p>
