 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 87: The Broken Person</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao arose early the next morning. &nbsp;She pulled aside the curtains to let the morning sunlight shine all across the bedroom. &nbsp;Then she opened the loft windows and stepped out onto the balcony, where she took a deep breath of fresh air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai was still in the bed, but between A-Jiao’s bustling and the piercing sunlight, there was no way he could remain asleep. &nbsp;He reluctantly got up and put on his clothing. &nbsp;Standing next to A-Jiao, he quietly asked her, “Why are you up so early this morning, Honey?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;To prevent you from sleeping in!” said A-Jiao, putting on her best cute face for him. &nbsp;“Go wash up now! &nbsp;I hope you didn’t forget that I plan on helping you go through Sister Xiu’s belongings today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right!” Jiang Zhengkai helplessly replied. &nbsp;Whenever he was around her, he always wanted to forget about his work, however temporarily, and focus his attention on A-Jiao and A-Jiao alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on! &nbsp;Hurry up!” &nbsp;A-Jiao stood beside Jiang Zhengkai and prompted him again, “Don’t just stand there! &nbsp;Don’t you have to work today?” &nbsp;Clearly, she wanted to use the morning pre-work hours to help him find the documents that he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” hesitated Jiang Zhengkai as he looked at her. &nbsp;He then gently raised his hand and grabbed her shoulder. &nbsp;“Actually, Honey… could you… perhaps… hand over all of A-Xiu’s possessions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” A-Jiao remarked in surprise as Jiang Zhengkai muttered his way through his request. &nbsp;She tightly bit down on her lips and stood silently still. &nbsp;A-Jiao hadn’t thought Jiang Zhengkai would ask this of her, but, sharp as she ever was, it only took a moment before she realized that she should have anticipated such a question from Jiang Zhengkai sooner. &nbsp;He was a detective, after all. &nbsp;True, A-Jiao was loathe to part with the belongings that A-Xiu had left behind, but she also knew that Jiang Zhengkai really needed them for his case. &nbsp;She cocked her head, blinked her eyes, and then softly said, “Honey, could you return these things to me once you’re done with them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” &nbsp;Seeing how A-Jiao had agreed to his request, Jiang Zhengkai immediately nodded in response. &nbsp;“I promise!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then. &nbsp;Now go and wash up!” said A-Jiao as she left his side. &nbsp;“I put them all in the storage room, but there’s a lot of stuff in there. &nbsp;Let me dig them up and help you load them into your car after breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Honey!” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai chased after A-Jiao and gave her a tight back-hug. &nbsp;Naturally, her body leaned back into his. &nbsp;No normal woman would reject such a romantic act from the man she loved. &nbsp;A satisfied smile appeared on A-Jiao’s face: not because of Jiang Zhengkai’s hug, but because she genuinely felt his love for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After breakfast, A-Jiao led Jiang Zhengkai into her condo’s storage room. &nbsp;The fact that most Chinese urban dwellers lived in high-rise apartments or condominiums instead of townhomes or single-family homes meant that they didn’t have basements or garages in which to store things. &nbsp;As a result, builders of apartment or condo units usually included what was, in essence, an enlarged closet where residents could store their belongings. &nbsp;Inside A-Jiao’s luxury condo unit was a storage room approximately 160 square feet in size. &nbsp;Other than the corner that was right next to the door, where there was a pile of various leftover debris from everyday products, the rest of the storage unit was fully furnished as a whole other bedroom. &nbsp;This included a bed, vanity, chair, and television, as well as those pieces of furniture that a woman couldn’t live without: a dresser and a shoe rack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Honey, it’s all yours!” A-Jiao mischievously pointed at the room’s furnishings. &nbsp;“These all belonged to Sister Xiu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoa, all of it?” &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai looked at everything in the room and then turned around to look at A-Jiao. &nbsp;“You didn’t collect </span><i><span style>everything </span></i><span style>that belonged to her, did you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I did!” &nbsp;A-Jiao pursed her lips and laughed. &nbsp;“I’m not Sister Xiu, so how would I know what she wanted to keep and what she wanted to throw away? &nbsp;Plus, it’s not like I’m hurting for space in this condo, so I hired some guys and moved all of her things in here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” Jiang Zhengkai laughed foolishly at A-Jiao, knowing full well that she was intentionally messing with him. &nbsp;“I only need her paper documents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh uh, you’ve got to take it all!” insisted A-Jiao, leaving no room for negotiation. &nbsp;“These things all belong to your sub-bureau now. &nbsp;Take it, take it all!” she said as she pushed him into the storage room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey! &nbsp;Honey! &nbsp;How about this? &nbsp;I agree to take custody of the contents of this storage room on behalf of the sub-bureau, but could I maybe temporarily store them here for the time being?” pleaded Jiang Zhengkai when he realized the situation he had gotten himself into. &nbsp;His police cruiser wasn’t a pickup truck, so there was no way he could cart all of this back to the sub-bureau himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only if you pay me a storage fee!” said A-Jiao as she extended her hand towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is five yuan enough?” asked Jiang Zhengkai with an evil grin on his face, waiting for A-Jiao’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;I’ll kill you!” &nbsp;A-Jiao knew that she had once again fallen into a hole that she had dug for herself. &nbsp;She hurled invective at Jiang Zhengkai, while also pushing and hitting his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A couple in love can turn a seemingly trivial matter into something special and sweet. &nbsp;That’s exactly what A-Jiao and Jiang Zhengkai were like, despite the fact they should’ve been natural enemies given their respective professions. &nbsp;Who would’ve thought that they could live together happily under the same roof? &nbsp;Life is beautiful indeed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, life was not so beautiful for Cui Jing today. &nbsp;She finally woke up, groggy and disoriented, well into the afternoon. &nbsp;Compared to Wei Xin and Feng Lina, though, she could be considered fortunate; her naked body was lying on a bed in a luxury hotel, not in some dirty ditch by the side of the road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Jing endured the searing pain in her lower body as she sat up on the bed. &nbsp;Her memories of last night were a complete haze. &nbsp;She only remembered accompanying Li Hongbin and his southern clients into a nightclub and then drinking a shot of cognac. &nbsp;As for what happened afterwards, she had no recollection whatsoever. &nbsp;Still, given the state of her body, did it really matter if she recalled what happened last night or not? &nbsp;As a woman of normal intelligence, she of course realized what had happened to her body last night. &nbsp;Even if she couldn’t figure it out just from the way her body felt, the blood-stained sheets and towels should have been more than sufficient to tell her that what had happened to her body could only happen between a man and a woman, and it had happened much more than just once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With great difficulty, Cui Jing got out of bed and stepped onto the floor. &nbsp;She found a blanket and wrapped herself in it as she walked into the bathroom to take a shower. &nbsp;She knew that Li Hongbin had to have been involved in what had happened to her. &nbsp;Even though Cui Jing was very naive when it came to Li Hongbin, she wasn’t stupid. &nbsp;She wouldn’t be foolish enough to believe that Li Hongbin was innocent, that he was just a bystander. &nbsp;Right now, she felt heartbroken, as if her heart had been torn out and cut into a thousand little pieces. &nbsp;She couldn’t believe the man she’d trusted and loved the most would actually sell her body in exchange for money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Cui Jing came out of the bathroom, she picked up her torn and tattered clothing that had been strewn all across the floor. &nbsp;She sorted through her clothes and put on the pieces that had more or less managed to survive the wild orgy last night. &nbsp;The rest, she threw away. &nbsp;She then picked up her purse, opened the door, and silently left the hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the road, the warm afternoon sun illuminated Cui Jing’s entire body, yet she didn’t feel the slightest bit of warmth. &nbsp;She waddled absentmindedly down the sidewalk as she considered whether she should call Li Hongbin and report that she had “successfully” completed her mission. &nbsp;She also felt that he should be the one to call her. &nbsp;Even if she were a mere tool to Li Hongbin, he should still care about whether she was alive or dead. &nbsp;At that thought, Cui Jing took out her cell phone and helplessly looked at its home screen. &nbsp;There were no calls from Li Hongbin. &nbsp;It looked like she had already been forgotten by her erstwhile boyfriend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Jing threw her cell phone back into her purse and continued her aimless march forward. &nbsp;The sidewalk was filled with pedestrians, but none of them cared to notice Cui Jing’s expression, none of them cared about where this beautiful woman was headed. &nbsp;Life, the basis for a person’s existence, was also the entirety of a person’s existence, but to a third person, it was an abstraction that seemed less real than the tiniest speck of dust that flew into the person’s eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the hour hand pointed at the number two, Cui Jing’s cell phone finally rang. &nbsp;The wandering Cui Jing, who seemed to have been lost at sea, acted as if she suddenly found dry land again. &nbsp;She rapidly grabbed her cell phone from her purse and held it with shaking hands to her ear. &nbsp;She hoped the voice that came over from the other side would be the one she longed for, but reality would disappoint her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello? &nbsp;Cui Jing? &nbsp;Where are you?” A-Jiao’s voice said urgently over the phone. &nbsp;“Are you not teaching your afternoon classes either today? &nbsp;Did you forget that one of our classes has an open-house today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! &nbsp;I… I’m not feeling well…” Cui Jing stiffly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All you do is spend time with that playboy boyfriend of yours!” A-Jiao continued saying over the phone. &nbsp;“Get here ASAP! &nbsp;The principal is starting to get pissed! &nbsp;Hurry back! &nbsp;I’ll do my best to keep Principal Li and them at bay!” &nbsp;The call dropped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Work… that’s right! &nbsp;I need to go to work today…</span></i><span style> &nbsp;Cui Jing’s mind had turned to mush, but she managed to gather her thoughts and hailed a taxi from the side of the road. &nbsp;She then directed the driver to take her to the preschool.</span></p>
