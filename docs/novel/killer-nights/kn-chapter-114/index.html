 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 114: The Long Explanation</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After returning to the sub-bureau, Jiang Zhengkai immediately called Zhang Nan to inform him of the situation. &nbsp;He also ordered Liu Kun and Du Yuting to lead a small task force into the alley. Right now, their number one priority was to surveill and protect the two women who’d been involved in A-Xiu’s murder and were still alive. &nbsp;They now held the key to perhaps finally solving this case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After doing all of that, Jiang Zhengkai returned to his desk. &nbsp;Now was the time to use that intelligent brain of his to go over the overall progress of this case. &nbsp;All the evidence he’d collected about the serial murders seemed to be pointing to the conclusion that someone had killed off all those people in order to avenge A-Xiu. &nbsp;Nevertheless, there were still many unanswered questions that required an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first murder had involved A-Mei and Zhao Renchu; Zhao had had a prior relationship with A-Xiu. &nbsp;The second murder had involved A-Hua and Yin Tao, with A-Hua having been involved in A-Xiu’s murder. &nbsp;The fourth murder had involved A-Dan and Tang Xiaosheng; Tang had been one of Sui Dequan’s henchmen, so he’d probably had some type of connection with A-Xiu as well. &nbsp;The sixth murder had involved A-Di and Cao Shucong; A-Di and A-Xiu came from the same hometown, and the two had lived together immediately prior to A-Xiu’s death, so A-Di was inextricably connected to A-Xiu as well. &nbsp;The seventh murder had involved A-Lian and Guo Dinggang, both of whom had connections with A-Xiu. The eighth murder had involved A-Xue and Zhao Shuhai, with A-Xue being another one of the women involved in A-Xiu’s murder. &nbsp;And the ninth murder had involved had A-Bi and Liu Chengjiang; again, A-Bi had been one of A-Xiu’s co-murderers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But that still left the third and fifth murders. &nbsp;What type of connection did the victims in those two murders have with A-Xiu? Trying to puzzle it out made Jiang Zhengkai furrow his brow even tighter. &nbsp;Was there some missing clue he hadn’t discovered about those four victims: A-Li, Liu Nanquan, Yin Zhumei, and Zhu Yuping? Did they have some kind of a secret connection to A-Xiu? &nbsp;He circled all four of their names on his whiteboard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Jiang Zhengkai shifted his attention to A-Di’s name. &nbsp;According to A-Jiao, A-Di had met with A-Xiu shortly before A-Xiu’s stint at the local police station. Afterwards, A-Xiu left town, and so did A-Di. &nbsp;Moreover, A-Ping had said that A-Di should have been in this city during the time A-Xiu was being interrogated in the police station. She also said that A-Di hadn’t wanted to return to the city, but eventually agreed to do so. &nbsp;If what A-Ping had said was true, then did that mean A-Di had also been involved in A-Xiu’s death? Maybe A-Di had stolen A-Xiu’s money, and that was what eventually resulted in A-Xiu’s death?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A-Di stole A-Xiu’s money…</span></i><span style> Jiang Zhengkai’s mind lingered on this thought. &nbsp;If that really were the case, then that could explain why wire payments to A-Xiu’s family back home had continued unabated for three months after her death. &nbsp;Maybe A-Di had felt guilty for stealing A-Xiu’s money and causing her death? But A-Di hadn’t actually been involved in A-Xiu’s murder, and A-Tie never told anyone about A-Xiu’s death, so how did A-Di find out that A-Xiu had died? &nbsp;Perhaps A-Di had never learned about A-Xiu’s death at all, and instead the two of them already had some kind of a deal where A-Di would help A-Xiu wire money home?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai sighed once more. &nbsp;Alas, A-Xiu and A-Di were dead, and dead women tell no tales. &nbsp;His only hope was to track down A-Hui and A-Ying, in the hopes that they knew something that could shed light on all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just then, his cell phone rang. &nbsp;A-Jiao’s voice crackled over the receiver. &nbsp;“Hey, Honey, are you not planning on picking me up today? &nbsp;If that’s the case, then I guess I’ll just walk home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Jiang Zhengkai heard A-Jiao’s voice, he sat up straight in his chair and stretched out. &nbsp;“Alright, just wait in the preschool for a bit. I’ll come over to pick you up right now. Remember not to go outside!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sprang up from his desk and walked out into the open office space. &nbsp;“Liu Na,” he called out as he walked, “tell our colleagues at the External Affairs Division to look into the withdrawal and wire transfer records of A-Xiu’s bank account. &nbsp;I want to know exactly when and where each transaction took place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he looked over towards Lu Xiaoqiang. &nbsp;“By the way, Xiaoqiang, are you going to the alley in the evenings? &nbsp;If so, go and find A-Ping. See if she can give you any additional leads regarding A-Di. &nbsp;See if she noticed any changes in A-Di’s demeanor or behavior before A-Di left the provincial capital and after she returned two and a half years ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Inspector Jiang!” Liu Na and Lu Xiaoqiang replied in unison. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai then quickly left the office to go pick up A-Jiao from the preschool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao stood inside the preschool’s front door. &nbsp;When she saw Jiang Zhengkai’s car park in front of the preschool, she happily ran over and climbed into the passenger seat. &nbsp;“You’re starting to take me for granted, aren’t you? Aren’t you afraid that someone will kidnap me again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, no way!” laughed Jiang Zhengkai as he squeezed A-Jiao’s nose. &nbsp;“You’ve got good karma written all over you, so I’m sure nothing bad will happen. &nbsp;Besides, now that you look like a schoolteacher… never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” &nbsp;A-Jiao didn’t know quite how to respond at first, but she soon caught Jiang Zhengkai’s drift. &nbsp;She balled her hands into fists and started pounding him as she shrieked, “What were you going to say? &nbsp;Were you going to say nobody wants me anymore? Tell me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t say anything!” replied Jiang Zhengkai, as he dodged A-Jiao’s blows while trying to grab her hands. &nbsp;“I was going to say you’re so beautiful, and that I love the schoolteacher look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! &nbsp;Whatever!” &nbsp;Although A-Jiao verbally protested, her heart nevertheless felt a sense of sweetness. &nbsp;“So, tell me! You’re saying all these nice things to me today because you need my help again, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Need your help, eh?” &nbsp;Seeing A-Jiao’s naughty face lifted Jiang Zhengkai’s spirits momentarily before he became serious once again. &nbsp;“Well, there is something I wanted to tell you, but I’m afraid it’ll upset you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? &nbsp;What is it?” &nbsp;Seeing Jiang Zhengkai’s expression turn grave, A-Jiao quietly sat down in the passenger seat. &nbsp;She stared out the windshield and said, “Go ahead and tell me. I’m not looking at you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, alright then!” &nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw A-Jiao like this, Jiang Zhengkai couldn’t help but smile. &nbsp;He knew she’d turned her face away because she didn’t want him to see her look upset. &nbsp;“I’m just going to say it, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, go ahead!” A-Jiao nodded as she sat in the passenger seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Xiu’s dead. &nbsp;She died two and a half years ago. &nbsp;A-Tie buried her himself,” Jiang Zhengkai said in a soothing tone of voice as he carefully observed any changes in A-Jiao’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s dead? &nbsp;Sister Xiu is dead?” exclaimed A-Jiao as she unhesitatingly turned towards Jiang Zhengkai and looked at him in shock. &nbsp;“How? But… she…” Clearly, she was at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, she’s dead.” &nbsp;Seeing A-Jiao’s expression, Jiang Zhengkai breathed a sigh of relief. </span><i><span style>&nbsp;No, it’s not her. &nbsp;She looks like this was the first she’s heard about A-Xiu’s death.</span></i><span style> &nbsp;“Earlier in the day I stopped by the hospital to check up on A-Tie. &nbsp;He personally told me that A-Xiu’s dead, that she had been killed by several other women from the alley.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who did it?” A-Jiao blurted out. &nbsp;She timidly glanced at Jiang Zhengkai, unsure whether he would reveal the identities of the women involved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There were quite a few women involved,” replied Jiang Zhengkai as he observed A-Jiao’s every move. &nbsp;“A-Hua, A-Xue, A-Bi, and A-Lian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just those four?” asked A-Jiao, as she focused her attention on Jiang Zhengkai’s face once more. &nbsp;“I bet there were probably a few others, no? What about A-Hui and A-Ying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Hui and A-Ying...?” Jiang Zhengkai noncommittally repeated the question. &nbsp;“Why do you think A-Hui and A-Ying were involved?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because Sister Xiu was best friends with those two as well as the girls you mentioned,” replied A-Xiu as she delved into her memories. &nbsp;“Back then, I would go visit Sister Xiu at her place all the time. I often saw those other girls at her place discussing something or other. &nbsp;After Sister Xiu left, they all left the alley for some time as well. Afterwards, when I asked A-Hua and A-Hui about Sister Xiu’s whereabouts, they both said that she had gone back to her hometown and that it might take a while before she returned. &nbsp;Of course, Sister Xiu never did come back, and I never saw her again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about A-Ying? &nbsp;Did you know her well?” Jiang Zhengkai continued asking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not really,” A-Jiao shook her head. &nbsp;“A-Ying… I think she’s still in the alley. &nbsp;I remember seeing her there just a few days before I was kidnapped…” &nbsp;She brushed away tears that had suddenly welled up in the corner of her eyes. &nbsp;“Why… why did they kill Sister Xiu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They didn’t mean to kill her,” Jiang Zhengkai calmly said. &nbsp;“According to A-Tie, they had some kind of a financial dispute with her. &nbsp;In the midst of the struggle, A-Xiu was fatally injured and subsequently died.” &nbsp;He purposely hid the fact that A-Xiu had been forced to drink large quantities of saltwater and had died an excruciating death as the result of dehydration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see…” muttered A-Jiao as she heard his explanation. &nbsp;“But when I went to gather Sister Xiu’s belongings, I didn’t see anything out of place… it didn’t look like there were any signs of a struggle…”</span></p>
