 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 32: A-Jiao's New Life</span></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Time went by one monotonous day after another, as undercover policewomen and prostitutes continued their daily routine of “up at dusk and down at dawn” in the alley. &nbsp;They walked the streets together and solicited clients together, except the target clientele was a bit different between the two groups. &nbsp;The policewomen had as their clients their own husbands, while the prostitutes had as their clients strangers who they’d never met before. &nbsp;Nevertheless, from a bystander’s point of view, they were all engaged in the same line of work. &nbsp;Could one truly tell which woman was an undercover officer and which was a real prostitute?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, the municipal bureau headquarters is promoting a citywide community outreach program. &nbsp;The external affairs office wanted to ask if we should send someone to participate,” Liu Na sais as she entered Jiang Zhengkai’s office. &nbsp;Liu Na had taken over most of Wei Xin’s responsibilities during her absence; even though Wei Xin had returned to duty by now, Liu Na continued to handle many of her original duties. &nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai had taken Wei Xin off of case work to prevent her from getting hurt again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know what? &nbsp;I’ve got an idea. &nbsp;Why don’t we send Wei Xin?” said Jiang Zhengkai as he stood up to leave. &nbsp;He had an armed robbery case that he had to investigate these days, but before he left, he glanced at the alley duty roster in Liu Na’s hand. &nbsp;“Don’t include Wei Xin in the nightly watch schedule. &nbsp;Let her rest some more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir!” Liu Na acknowledged with a nod. &nbsp;She was also a veteran police officer, so she understood where Jiang Zhengkai was coming from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Wei, Inspector Jiang wanted you to help External Affairs with the community outreach program,” Liu Na warmly informed Wei Xin as she returned to their shared desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does that mean I won’t be able to stand watch in the alley again?” Wei Xin asked with a hint of disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, silly girl!” teased Liu Na as she reached across the table to pinch Wei Xin’s nose. &nbsp;“This is Inspector Jiang’s way of taking care of you! &nbsp;Think about it: you get to be on TV, maybe become famous. &nbsp;Look, Inspector Jiang set you up with all of the sweet gigs, so why would you want to go back to the alley? &nbsp;The only thing waiting for you there is catching a cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, you’re right,” Wei Xin replied with a smile. &nbsp;She knew Jiang Zhengkai was trying to take care of her, and that was enough for her. &nbsp;She didn’t care about the reasons why.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, A-Jiao found herself a new job as a preschool teacher. &nbsp;Even though the job paid peanuts compared to what she did before, she nevertheless felt very happy doing it. &nbsp;She felt being with children all day helped cleanse her soul and made her feel younger. &nbsp;It also made happiness that much easier to obtain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Ren, do you like my drawing?” a four-year-old boy asked as he ran over to A-Jiao holding a drawing in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I love it!” A-Jiao replied while patting the little boy on his head. &nbsp;“Is this a drawing of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yup! &nbsp;You have such beautiful short hair,” the boy answered. &nbsp;He quietly whispered, “Ms. Ren, I’m going to tell you a secret. &nbsp;Daddy says you are prettier than my mommy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao laughed heartily at that. &nbsp;“Haha, make sure to keep that just between us, okay? &nbsp;Alright, here’s a gold star for you. &nbsp;Now go and play with your friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The preschool principal Ms. Li appeared beside A-Jiao. &nbsp;“Ms. Ren, the school has decided that it will be starting a new gifted art class after all, so it looks like you’re going to have even more on your plate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Li,” A-Jiao replied. &nbsp;Oh, that’s right, A-Jiao’s real name was Ren Ziyuan, not Lin A-Jiao, and her government-issued identification showed that she wasn’t from Turpan either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And don’t worry about compensation. &nbsp;The school will arrange for a raise that is commensurate with your added responsibilities,” Ms. Li reassured A-Jiao. &nbsp;What a likeable girl this new teacher was: always hardworking, and never complaining about her pay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Ms. Li,” A-Jiao replied contently. &nbsp;“I just like playing with the kids all day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’ll make a good mother one day.” &nbsp;Ms. Li smiled and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Late in the afternoon, A-Jiao sent the last child off before locking up the classroom and getting ready to go home. &nbsp;Just as she was about to leave, a BMW pulled up to the curb and rolled down the passenger-side window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Ren, care for a lift?” said a young, handsome man in the driver’s seat. &nbsp;His family must be rich if he was driving around in a Beemer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, thank you. &nbsp;Aren’t you here to pick up Cui Jing?” A-Jiao asked as she dipped her head to look at the driver, who was wearing his signature thin smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, her! &nbsp;Isn’t today her day off?” &nbsp;The man hesitated before saying, “I came by to run some errands, and then I ran into you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah? &nbsp;Well, thank you for the offer, but I prefer to walk,” A-Jiao retorted as she straightened her back, waved at the car window, and walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuck that disrespectful bitch!” the man said as his fist forcefully struck the car’s steering wheel. &nbsp;“No way there’s a woman out there that could resist Li Hongbin’s charms.” &nbsp;Even so, he knew there wasn’t going to be another opportunity today for him to try again with A-Jiao, so he drove away sullen and disgruntled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The city at night had become unusually beautiful in A-Jiao’s eyes. &nbsp;She liked looking at the streetlights lining its avenues and the radiant splendour of its multicolored neon signs. &nbsp;Before long, she had strolled over to Uncle Cai’s noodle shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Cai, hand-cut noodles, please!” A-Jiao shouted joyfully as she walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coming right up, hon!” Uncle Cai responded as he came out of the kitchen to greet A-Jiao. &nbsp;“You’re early today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I got off early today,” A-Jiao replied as she happily looked at Uncle Cai. &nbsp;“Oh, and I also want half an order of </span><i><span style>khapsey</span></i><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you got it!” &nbsp;Uncle Cai wiped down her table before returning to the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao sat down at her table. &nbsp;She couldn’t help but noticing a couple sitting at another table, quietly chatting while feeding each other noodles. &nbsp;As she watched, her mind fell into some kind of a trance…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You shut up! &nbsp;Besides, nothing good comes out of your mouth anyway,”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“What did you say?”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“I said hurry up and eat!”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You can’t eat that much salt yet!”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Hey, mister big-shot police officer, did you used to be a kindergarten teacher or something? &nbsp;Is that why you’re treating me like a child?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that thought, A-Jiao pursed her lips into a smile. &nbsp;In an ironic twist of fate, it hadn’t been Jiang Zhengkai that became a kindergarten teacher, but rather herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you thinking about? &nbsp;Must be pretty funny with that big grin on your face,” Uncle Cai said as he brought over a bowl of hand-cut noodles, a small saucer of fermented paste, and half a portion of </span><i><span style>khapsey</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing. &nbsp;I’m just happy to see you!” A-Jiao said flirtingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So I’ve got something to tell you, but promise me you won’t get mad,” Uncle Cai said as he looked at A-Jiao’s face. &nbsp;He saw A-Jiao slowly nod her head, so he continued, “Well, I asked Jiang. &nbsp;He said he liked you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the heck, Uncle Cai! &nbsp;Who told you to ask him that?” A-Jiao exclaimed as her lips started to pout. &nbsp;She writhed uncomfortably in her chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe! &nbsp;You have to hurry up though! &nbsp;Jiang is quite a catch,” Uncle Cai laughed as he went off to serve other customers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, so annoying…” A-Jiao briskly muttered to herself as she sat there with her head cocked and her body softly rocking back and forth. &nbsp;Before long, her face had turned bright red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she was done eating, A-Jiao paid in cash, placing the bills underneath her noodle bowl. &nbsp;She said farewell to Uncle Cai and started to leave the restaurant. &nbsp;As soon as she stepped out of the front door, a well-built man walked in and shouted, “Uncle Cai! &nbsp;A large bowl of hand-cut noodles with extra paste and a serving of </span><i><span style>khapsey</span></i><span style>, please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this voice, A-Jiao quickly turned around and looked at that man for a second. &nbsp;She then quickly walked away from the restaurant. &nbsp;Perhaps life liked playing tricks on people, if it let you brush past the person you loved, only to not recognize who she was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Jiao continued walking under the night sky. &nbsp;She soon neared the alley and her own home. &nbsp;She thought about it for a while, but decided not to proceed any further. &nbsp;She turned around and walked in the direction of the old house. &nbsp;At precisely that moment, that well-built man darted out of the noodle shop and ran furiously in the direction of the alley, but alas, the two of them had just missed each other once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In three short minutes, life had given Jiang Zhengkai two opportunities, but he’d failed to seize on either of them. &nbsp;In his mind, A-Jiao was still that girl with the long flowing hair. &nbsp;How could he have known that the short-haired beauty who’d walked right past him was the same woman he was looking for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inspector Jiang, you’re in early this evening,” one of the police officers manning the surveillance room politely greeted Jiang Zhengkai as he charged in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quick! &nbsp;Pull up surveillance footage from the last ten minutes!” Jiang Zhengkai ordered, even though he was clearly out of breath and leaning on the door for support. &nbsp;“See if there was a woman entering the alley!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t see any woman entering the alley during the last ten minutes, sir,” the officer reported after fast-forwarding through the last ten minutes of surveillance footage. &nbsp;Ever since Wei Xin had been attacked, Yao Tianyu ordered that the entire alley be covered by police surveillance cameras.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhengkai carefully reviewed the surveillance footage. &nbsp;Suddenly, he discovered a familiar silhouette walking past on the street opposite the alley. &nbsp;The video was grainy, but it looked like… A-Jiao.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>BAM! </span></i><span style>&nbsp;Jiang Zhengkai brought his fist down with great force on the surveillance room’s keyboard. &nbsp;He turned around and quietly walked out the door. &nbsp;“I’m tired. &nbsp;I’m going back home to sleep now.”</span></p>
