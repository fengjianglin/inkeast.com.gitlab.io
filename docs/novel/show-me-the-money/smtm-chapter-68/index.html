 <p><span style>Chapter 68 – The Powerful Minotaur Chieftain</span></p>
 <p><span style>PureElegance frowned when she heard the report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ice Witch didn’t think too much of it, she merely muttered softly, “He really is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who? Money Grubber!?” PureElegance’s expression worsened. She sliced down with her hand. “Guild Master, how about we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think that he’ll wait in the cave and let us block him off?” Ice Witch glanced at PureElegance. “It’s not like you don’t know rogues have stealth. How hard do you think it’ll be to get him to talk with us without blocking him off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty was very satisfied to be able to get forty something strands of Snowsilver Grass. He knew that he wasn’t able to kill the Minotaur Chieftain by himself, so being able to get something is already very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he came out of the cave in stealth and noticed the… intriguing atmosphere, he immediately changed his mind out returning to town. </span><i><span style>This new guild doesn’t seem weak. If they end up fighting the Ice Rose Alliance, then Lord Fatty might be able to get something extra.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>PureElegance felt like nothing was going her way with the Eagle Fortress in front of her and Money Grubber hiding in the dark, so she did make some small mistakes while directing her subordinates. </span><i><span style>Damnit, I should have just killed Money Grubber.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks like the beauties of the Ice Rose Alliance aren’t able to hold on for much longer,” BlackEagle laughed when he saw the Minotaur Chieftain force the Ice Rose Alliance players back repeatedly. “Brothers, let us give these beauties a hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You’re not going to wait to take advantage of us anymore?” PureElegance laughed coldly when she saw the rival guild surround them. She immediately gave the command for some of her subordinates to block those players off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, pretty Pure, don’t think about buying time. Allow me to tell your that our Fortress Master is personally blocking off Rosethorn, so I fear your reinforcements will not come in time,” BlackEagle stepped forward and said slowly. “You’re all beauties, so my brothers and I are reluctant to do anything to you. Go back home by yourselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, you’re going to have to show us some actual strength if you want us to give up on the boss. Don’t just think that numbers will make a difference,” PureElegance said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, two terrible screams rang out. Two Ice Rose Alliance warriors were hit by the Minotaur Chieftain’s Axe, then instantly went silent upon hitting the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were instakilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Minotaur seemed to indulge in the bloodlust, and stomped on the ground with its hoof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the minotaurs’ racial skill, War Stomp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A visible shockwave spread through the ground. The ten-odd Ice Rose Alliance players closest to the monster were stunned and received continuous damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Minotaur Chieftain swung its axe, and hit a stunned knight, who could only watch herself get chopped in half by the weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty did not actually notice the skill while he was killing the minotaurs, because he had Wheat lead all the minotaurs into his trap, where it wasn’t much use at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, as expected of a gold boss, it truly is extraordinary,” BlackEagle praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rally together, don’t let the boss stun any more people,” PureElegance wasn’t in the mood to argue with BlackEagle. She ordered her subordinates to quickly retreat and gather together. The priests continuously cast heals onto the foremost knights, and finally managed to prevent them from being killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Ice Beauty, consider my suggestion?” BlackEagle smiled carefreely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re leaving,” Ice Witch gritted her teeth and said after a final glance at the Minotaur Chieftain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild Master?” PureElegance didn’t want to give up. However, when she saw the ferocious Minotaur Chieftain, then at the prowling Eagle Fortress players, she could only stomp her feet. “BlackEagle. I’ll remember this. You better be careful in the future. We’re leaving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Rose Alliance players led the Minotaur Chieftain to where the Eagle Fortress players waited, then returned to town using Recall Scrolls under the watchful eyes of the rival guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did BlackEagle smile, “Brothers, be careful. Don’t get too hasty. Rogues, start laying traps. Melee players tank the hits. Healers, heal properly. This boss monster is ours, and the Guild Establishment Token will also be ours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are the number one guild in Black Tortoise City!” the Eagle Fortress players chanted loudly, then spread out and attacked the Minotaur Chieftain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eagle Fortress was naturally not a weak guild as they dared to threaten the Ice Rose Alliance. The hundred something layers averaged at around Level 21 or 22, and most of them had a set of bronze equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few knights who have clearly put all their stat points into Endurance rushed up to tank the Minotaur, and when the monster swung its axe at them, it actually failed to instakill them. However, they were still pushed back. A few healing lights landed on them, quickly restoring them. They let out a battle cry, then surrounded the Minotaur Chieftain once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the boss monster was held down by those players, the other players immediately began their assault. It was apparent the Eagle Fortress had investigated the boss monster thoroughly. Aside from the full endurance knights, the other players were practically all ranged attackers with only a few rogues setting traps on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Minotaur Chieftain roared in anger and continuously swung its axe and attacked the knights keeping it buy. Yet, the knights were working very well together. Once one of them takes a hit, another will immediately take his place, while the injured player will be healed by his priest teammates and ensure that his health is full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty was very surprised by this when he saw the Eagle Fortress players react to the Minotaur’s War Stomp. </span><i><span style>Man, the world is truly filled with hidden talents. These Eagle Fortress guys really maintained a low profile! They look very experienced at ganging up on people!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps due to annoyed by the knights, the Minotaur Chieftain roared loudly once more. A red aura surrounded it, and raised its two-handed axe with both hands, then swung down at the head of a knight in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strike left no chance for the priests to heal the player, as it split the knight in half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful! That’s the Bloodlust of Warriors that increases the users’ attack. Just wait for the red aura to dim,” BlackEagle quickly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining knights immediately retreated. Yet, the Minotaur Chieftain seemed to be possessed by a god as it chased the players down and hacked two more knights dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat! Use the traps to stop it,” BlackEagle commended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rogues quickly put down a series of traps which the knights then ran to. But during so, the Minotaur Chieftain killed another one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got ‘em! Attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eagle Fortress players were overjoyed when they saw the Minotaur stepped into a trap. However, before they could use any of their skills, the Minotaur Chieftain shook its body, broke the trap and walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two archers, who could not get out of the way in times, were instantly killed by a swing of the Minotaur Chieftain’s axe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, why’s it so powerful?” BlackEagle cursed. Originally, he had thought that even if the traps wouldn’t successfully trap the Minotaur Chieftain for long, it would be at least enough to buy them </span><i><span style>some </span></i><span style>time. He never expected the Minotaur Chieftain to be so powerful to just get out of the trap in less than a second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Knights, go and tank it! The guild will compensate you if you die,” BlackEagle had no choice, and could only order his subordinates to forcefully tank the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were ten-odd knights in the group, and all of them were fully invested in endurance. Although three of them had been killed, the remaining dozen or so still gritted their teeth, put a health potion into their mouths, then held one each in their hands before they charged towards the Minotaur Chieftain as if they were saying “kill me if you can”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attack! Attack! Use your strongest skills!” BlackEagle roared. He knew that they screwed up. They assumed that full endurance knights would be able to tank the Minotaur Chieftain. He didn’t expect the Minotaur Chieftain to be able to instakill them and ruining their plans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rogues! Keep setting up traps. I refuse to believe that it can’t be trapped. Knights, make sure the boss monster doesn’t move around. Priests, keep healing. The rest of you, attack!” BlackEagle roared. He also jumped in with a black saber and stood in front of the ranged players.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Minotaur Chieftain continued to swing its huge axe around. The knights surrounding it cried out in pain. The Minotaur Chieftain had a terribly high attack and in its current state, it out damaged the healing of all the priests together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of the players in the Eagle Fortress squad did possess crowd control abilities, but due to the large level difference, a huge ‘MISS’ would pop up above the monster’s head whenever they used them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everybody, go at it with your full strength. The guild will hand out benefits for you all after we kill the boss, and the ones who die get double!” Rewards were always motivating at critical moments. All of the other players immediately fought harder when they heard BlackEagle’s words. Even the knights begun attacking as they chugged down potions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a bit more than two hours, the Minotaur Chieftain’s health finally reached a critical low, while less than 20 Eagle Portress players remained. Aside from BlackEagle, who was a warrior, the rest were all rogues and archers. BlackEagle only focused on giving out orders, the rogues could go into stealth, the archers had a long attack range and also moved fast, so they were able to dodge the Minotaur Chieftain’s attacks as well. On the side note, all of the knights, mages and priests had already been sent back to down by the Minotaur Chieftain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Minotaur Chieftain was clearly tired as well. He panted heavily with its huge axe stuck in the ground, while injuries covered its body, and even its smooth fur was burnt black by all the spells launched at it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Haha, it’s finally Lord Fatty’s turn. </span></i><span style>Fatty had already been bored since a long time ago. He stood up, took out his dagger and sneaked towards the Minotaur Chieftain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, will this boss drop a Guild Establishment Token?” a rogue asked BlackEagle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>BlackEagle smiled, “I’m not sure, but our Fortress Master said it already. If it drops a Guild Establishment Token, then all brothers here today will get a hundred thousand RMB, and the ones who died gets fifty thousand extra.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? Thanks boss!” the rogue was excited, while the other players were also exhilarated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, don’t thank me yet. Let’s kill the boss monster first,” BlackEagle smiled. </span><i><span style>We’ll finally succeed this time.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Guild Establishment Token? Perhaps, but even if it drops, it won’t be yours. </span></i><span style>Fatty muttered to himself, then got behind the Minotaur Chieftain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, five daggers appeared out of thin air and stabbed the Minotaur Chieftain under the shocked gaze of the Minotaur Chieftain and the furious gaze of the Eagle Fortress players.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Minotaur Chieftain’s low health finally disappeared. It fell down with a terrible howl and dropped multiple items on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Daggers? </span></i><span style>Fatty looked over in surprise and saw a few members of God Familia standing beside him and smiling sleazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get the drops!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 2 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
