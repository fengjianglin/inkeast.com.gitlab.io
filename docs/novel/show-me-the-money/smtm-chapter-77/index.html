 <p><span style>Chapter 77 – All-Knowing Sect</span></p>
 <p><span style>RainWatcher smile exuded both purity and sexiness. Her long hair wavered as she smiled wryly. At the same time, an alluring fragrance seemed to be released from her mature body, causing all the men gathered to gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of the more beautiful women Fatty had seen, Purple Bell was a cute young girl; Liu Lan is a slightly sexy working woman; Ice Witch and Rosethorn represented hot and cold, making it hard for people to feel close to them; meanwhile, although his own little sister was the number one beauty of Vermillion Bird City, he felt like she lost to the mature RainWatcher when it came to the aura around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, RainWatcher was also followed by several Rainreveler players. All of them were beautiful and voluptuous, which only added to the allure of the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, please,” RainWatcher smiled and welcomed everyone upstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem,” Fatty coughed, then kicked TheFugitive on the leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>TheFugitive cried out in pain and complained, “F*ck dude, why the heck did you kick me? I was so close to getting in her pants and now that you kicked me, it’s all gone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>RainWatcher stiffened a little, she did not expect this famous expert to be so lecherous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Fatty snorted, “Fuge, I didn’t expect you to have such a hobby.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What hobby?” TheFugitive scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indulging in your fantasies,” HeadofGod shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh,” TheFugitive was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please have a seat,” When they reached the thirteenth floor, RainWatcher indicated, then sat down on the main seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the others took their seats, RainWatcher smiled and raised a glass of alcohol on the table. “I have asked you to come here unreasonably, so allow me to down this glass as an apology.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she downed the entire glass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!” TheFugitive applauded, then saw the others looking at him strangely. He disregarded the gaze. “Guild Master Watcher truly has great alcohol tolerance. Cheers!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously? </span></i><span style>The God Familia forced themselves not to laugh, while RainWatcher was clearly surprised by such a crappy reason from TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem,” HeadofGod coughed. “Guild Master Watcher, you didn’t call us here just to eat, right? It would be good if you could voice your reasons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Fatty sat straight without moving, as if he wasn’t interested in any of the beauties in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This lady here has heard of you, friends of God Familia. I wonder who this friend is?” RainWatcher looked towards Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s just my lackey, no need to mind him,” TheFugitive blurted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty nodded slightly as if he agreed to what TheFugitive said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Mr. Fugitive is so amazing. Even your lackey is so strong. This lady truly admires you,” RainWatcher didn’t force the issue when she saw that Fatty didn’t want to say anything. “I was rather troubled with something, but if you are willing to lend a hand, then it would be much easier. I wonder how much would it cost to ask you to help me kill a monster?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would depend on what monster it is,” HeadofGod was the one who was normally in charge of these transactions, so he thought about it for a moment and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Flame Demon?” RainWatcher replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Level 50 boss monster in the Fire Valley?” HeadofGod frowned, then glanced at the rest of the God Familia members. “It isn’t hard to kill a level 50 boss monster, but there are a lot of monsters in Fire Valley, it’s almost impossible to get to fight the boss monster by itself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why I would like to ask you for help,” RainWatcher smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hundred thousand gold coins, I’m not negotiating on the price,” HeadofGod reached out a finger. “What’s more, aside from the Guild Establishment Token, everything else belongs to us. We are not responsible if the token doesn’t drop either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did Mr. Head know that we want to get the Guild Establishment Token?” RainWatched asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I really cannot think of why else you would fight a Level 50 boss monster right now if not for a Guild Establishment Token,” HeadofGod chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, deal,” RainWatcher stood up and shook hands with HeadofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, they began to drink more and more until RainWatcher became a bit tipsy and couldn’t help but leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you two interested?” HeadofGod asked Fatty and TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” TheFugitive didn’t hold back, it wasn’t his first cooperation with the God Familia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty thought about it for a moment, “You guys know why I came. I’ll go and find you guys after I finish what I’m doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we shall wait patiently for Brother Grubber’s arrival,” HeadofGod nodded. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Fatty watched the God Familia and TheFugitive left, he strolled around in Vermillion Bird City. Now that the game had been running for some time, the players’ interest in farming had already waned a little, so everything seemed to have calmed down a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very easy to get information on Sword Manor as it was the third-ranked guild in Vermillion Bird City. However, ASliverofSmoke was apparently harder to get information about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve got maps for sale. It’s a map of the area around Vermillion Bird City, including all of the farming spots and monster information. You no longer have to feel lost when you’re farming,” at that moment, a rogue player selling maps walked by Fatty. When he saw Fatty strolling around aimlessly, he quickly walked over. “Bro, would you like a map?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What map is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This map I’m selling is created after the hard work of several thousand brothers in my sect. It includes all of the farming spots in a few thousand miles radius around Vermillion Bird City. It even includes everything ranging from monster information to the ores produced in various places to where all sorts of materials could be found. This is a complete map of the guide and we’re only selling it for 100 gold coins. It is the very definition of great and cheap. How’s that? Would you like one?” said the rogue called Bai Xiaosheng093.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All-Knowing Sect?” Fatty suddenly thought of something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, I hail from the All-Knowing Sect,” Bai Xiaosheng093 puffed up his chest with pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do you sell information?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” Bai Xiaosheng’s eyes darted around, then dragged Fatty into a corner. “Although we do not participate in any combat, we have the best intelligence in the entire game. As long as you can afford it, we can get any information you want for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much is information on ASliverofSmoke, the guild master of Sword Manor?” Fatty asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would depend on what you want to know,” Bai Xiaosheng093 nodded. “The price isn’t cheap for people like him from major factions, so consider it carefully.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know how far his relationship with Pink Beauty, the vice guild master of Rainrevelers, is,” Fatty asked after a deep breath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re definitely asking the right person,” Bai Xiaosheng093 laughed. “Let me tell you, I was the one who was sent to investigate about them. Actually, they. Mmm, please pay first. The price is 1000 gold coins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“1000 gold coins, are you kidding me!? I’ll pay you 100 gold coins at most,” Fatty roared softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re not willing, then never mind,” Bai Xiaosheng093 said indifferently. “This is a privacy question relating to the number one beauty and the guild master of the third-ranking guild in Vermillion Bird City. 1000 gold is already a discount.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, fine. Hurry up,” Fatty chucked over a bag of gold coins impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiaosheng093 counted the coins, then put them away happily. “Once upon a time, Pink Beauty, the number one beauty in Vermillion Bird City, was fighting a monster in the Land of Scorching Heat, but a boss monster suddenly came out. Just as Pink Beauty was about to fall to the evil beast, ASliverofSmoke, the guild master of the third-ranking guild in Vermillion Bird City passed by…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m asking you what stage their relationship is at, I’m not asking you these pointless matters,” Fatty grabbed Bai Xiaosheng093’s collar and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, fine, let go of me first,” Bai Xiaosheng slapped Fatty’s hand. When Faty let him go, he took a few deep breaths and continued. “ASliverofSmoke fell in love with Pink Beauty at first sight, but her attitude towards him is unclear. Although they often farm together, they have not yet confirmed their relationship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So they aren’t a couple?” Fatty let out a breath of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you must be Pink Beauty’s admirer as well, right? Bai Xiaosheng093 smiled lecherously. “Many people want to pursue a woman like Pink Beauty, including the guild masters of many major guilds. However, none of them have actually succeeded. At the very least, we, the All-Knowing Sect, have not found anything out yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Fatty patted Bai Xiaosheng093’s shoulder. “Thanks bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he turned around to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, are you not going to buy a map? It’s a newly created map. I promise that it’ll save you plenty of time when searching for monsters, allowing you to farm easily and level up speedily,” Bai Xiaosheng093 called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty thought about it for a moment, then handed over 100 gold coins, “Give me one then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure thing,” Bai Xiaosheng093 handed over a map.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty took a look. Although it was hand-drawn and was a bit rough, it did include the geographical features of each location, the various types of monsters and their levels and stats; alongside the areas where different ores and materials could be found.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, a part of it also indicated the spread of different monsters in Fire Valley and even listed the skills of the Flame Ruler.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, how is it? Isn’t it pretty complete? This was something that several thousand of us made after more than a month and countless deaths,” Bai Xiaosheng093 said proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, very good. It’s amazing,” Fatty praised. </span><i><span style>This 1100 gold coins I spent with him was very worthwhile.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, then do visit me often,” Bai Xiaosheng093 smiled. “If you are willing to pay me 10 more gold coins, then I can give you another piece of news as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really know how to do business,” Fatty chuckled. His mood was rather good when he heard that his little sister wasn’t dating, so he handed over another 10 gold coins. “What is it? Do tell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>RainWatcher, the guild master of Rainrevelers, hired the God Familia to help them kill the Flame Demon, a Level 50 boss for a Guild Establishment Token. However, someone leaked the news, so Myriad Swords, the ninth ranking guild of Vermillion Bird City rallied their people and said that they were going to block off the former guild within Fire Valley. At the same time, ASliverofSmoke, the guild master of Sword Manor, also led his people over to fight for the boss monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty took a deep breath. </span><i><span style>What an amazing information gathering speed. The deal between the God Familia and Rainrevelers was made less than an hour ago, and now they already know about it? This is terrifying!</span></i></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 2 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
