 <p><span style>Chapter 94 – Thunderfire Power Bomb</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty tossed out a pigeon egg sized jewel. It seemed like a ruby of excellent quality that shone bright red with what seemed to be red mist spiraling within. A hint of hot air seemed to rise out and form clouds around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This jewel was a Thunderfire Power Bomb that he got from Flame Ruler West. He only had seven of them and Fatty planned to use them against the advance boss monster in Greenery Mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wood attribute creatures are afraid of fire, and the Flame Ruler had said that although the Ancient Camphor Tree Spirit was an advance boss monster, it only possessed a mediocre strength. The biggest problem with it was that it would drive the nearby wood monsters to help it in combat. Before the Flame Ruler was sealed, he had once fought the tree spirit and caused it to howl with a bit of fire. If it wasn’t due to the lack of grudges between them, the Flame Ruler would have just outright killed the tree spirit. When he heard that Fatty wanted to take down the monster, the Flame Ruler generously gave him seven Thunderfire Power Bombs formed from fire and lightning energy. It would explode with lightning and fire and was extremely effective against wood monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty naturally tried to get a bit more when he heard how amazing it was, but the Flame Ruler refused at all costs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty chucked the bomb out, it flew in a beautiful arc and landed in front of the Horned Thundertiger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground shook, the nearby players trembled. A heat wave shot out from a trap and spread through the surroundings. All the trees in a ten-odd meters radius cracked, then snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A high-pitched wail sounded out from the trap, signaling that the Horned Thundertiger was terribly injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what was that?” Qian Xiaoqian’s face was filled with shock when she finally stood up straight. The other people also had looks of disbelief on their faces. </span><i><span style>A small jewel actually killed a low ranked yao!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was that Fatty couldn’t believe it either. </span><i><span style>The Flame Ruler didn’t say that it was this powerful!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Thunderfire Power Bomb. Hehe, they’re good stuff I got from the Flame Ruler,” Fatty had a smug on his face, then stuffed three into Qian Xiaoqian’s hands. “Keep it to protect yourself. Just chuck it at whoever you don’t like the looks of.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I…” Qian Xiaoqian tried to refuse frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you to keep it, so do it! No need to act courteously with your brother,” Fatty scolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, that’s good stuff. It’s seriously good stuff,” HeadofGod walked over and glanced at the three fiery red Thunderfire Power Bombs in Qian Xiaoqian’s hands. He couldn’t help but ask. “Brother Grubber, do you have any more? Sell a few to your bro, aye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’ve only got three more, so I can’t sell any to you,” Fatty smiled. “But… if you help me kill a monster, I don’t mind gifting them all to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, what monster?” HeadofGod said excitedly. He cracked all the bones in his body as if he was going to lead God Familia to kill it immediately after Fatty named it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Camphor Tree Spirit, advanced boss, Greenery Mountains, Azure Dragon City,” Fatty spoke out the words one by one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Advanced boss monster? </span></i><span style>HeadofGod’s expression stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, Brother Grub, why are you always getting ideas about that thing? You holdin’ a grudge?” TheFugitive questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got nothing against it, but it has something of mine there, so I have to get it back,” said Fatty. “Alright, let’s finish the Horned Thundertiger off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thunderfire Power Bomb already left the monster on the brink of death. It’s glorious fur was completely burnt and its seemingly holy horn was cracked in half. The monster was struggling in the trap and was clearly about to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? The horn broke? But that’s my mission item,” Qian Xiaoqian called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do? Let’s go and kill another one?” Fatty asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can’t,” Qian Xiaoqian pouted. There aren’t any Horned Thundertigers there. I only got teleported over to where they are because of the mission. The Horned Thundertiger is merely a monster of the lowest level there, I spent so much effort to lure it out. We’ll just die if we go there now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about it, try to turn in the horn. If it doesn’t work, then we try again. We’re able to kill a few of them since we have the THunderfire Power Bombs,” Fatty comforted her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Qian Xiaoqian nodded, casted a few spells to kill the Horned Thundertiger, then picked up the horn and activated a special portal to try and turn in the mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty wanted to follow, but when he noticed that only Qian Xiaoqian could teleport over, Fatty could only wait on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>used Harvest a few times towards the corpse of the monster and got a few bones and a ruined pelt. In contrast, the drops were truly amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first was a purple staff with lightning coiled around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thundershock Staff</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violet Item</span></p>
 <p><span style>Staff</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level Requirement: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack: 105 – 135</span></p>
 <p><span style>END: +10</span></p>
 <p><span style>INT: +15</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunder Damage: +10%</span></p>
 <p><span style>The extra thunder damage was perfect for Qian Xiaoqian after she gets her class enhancement. However, the level was too high, so it might have to be put away in storage for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from the staff, there were also two very nice items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiger Saber</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold Item</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saber</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level Requirement: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack: 120 – 145</span></p>
 <p><span style>END: +15</span></p>
 <p><span style>STR:+20</span></p>
 <p><span style>Windshattering Spear</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold Item</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spear</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level Requirement: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack: 115 – 140</span></p>
 <p><span style>END: +12</span></p>
 <p><span style>STR: +18</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from these, the rest were just some random drops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad, there are three weapons!” TheFugitive picked the items up, then handed them to Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty put the staff away, then passed the rest to HeadofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, what are you doing?” HeadofGod took a step back and refused it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Head, I’m not being courteous with you. I couldn’t have killed it without you guys. What’s more RightLeg also died for this. This is just compensation, so take it,” Fatty replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” HeadofGod waved his hand. “We do actual business. You ended up wasting a Thunderfire Power Bomb to kill it. We didn’t actually do anything, so how can we accept it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, HeadofGod pushed Fatty’s hand back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty tried to convince him otherwise a few more times, but seeing that HeadofGod was not going to change his mind, Fatty could only put the items away and patted HeadofGod’s shoulders. “If there’s anything I can help with in the future, then make sure you tell me. I won’t hold back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Fatty, that’s good. That’s a much better deal than the two items,” HeadofGod laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dude, hearing you call me Fatty sounds so much better than Brother Grubber or whatever else you call me,” Fatty also chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gentlemen, this lady is still here, don’t forget me,” RainbowWatcher giggled. “Fatty, can I call you that? About those two items…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” Fatty chuckled. “As for the two items, those are my spoils of the battle. If you want them, then pay for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>RainbowWatcher nearly choked. “But I don’t have any money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then don’t buy it,” Fatty was resolute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>RainbowWatcher rolled her eyes. </span><i><span style>I can’t let him continue speaking, he’s way too direct. Heh, it’s just two items, I’m going to ask our Vice Guild Master Pink Beauty.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a portal appeared. Qian Xiaoqian returned as quickly as she appeared and with her arrival, everybody could notice the change in her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her fiery robe was now blue that seemed to sparkle with lightning. The staff in her hands also turned into one that seemed to sizzle with electricity, and the rings around it also sparkled with lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I managed to change class!” Qian Xiaoqian reported excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, very good. Come here and show me what skills you have,” Fatty was very happy to see the success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thunder Arrow!” Qian Xiaoqian called out as she aimed towards a monster. An arrow formed from lightning shot out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster immediately exploded, leaving nothing behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, what powerful damage! You managed to instakill a level twenty something monster!” A player on the side exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty was very calm in contrast. For him who has seen Purple Bell’s damage, he naturally felt like trulyl high damage was something else. Purple Bell even managed to one shot a Yin Yang Spelltwister, a monster equivalent to a boss monster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro how is it?” Qian Xiaoqian asked proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, very good. You’ve got powerful attacks,” Fatty nodded and praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it was all thanks to you. Otherwise, I might not have been able to complete the mission and become a Thunder Magus,” Qian Xiaoqian giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good,” Fatty rubbed his little sister’s head lovingly, then handed the Thundershock Staff to her, “This dropped from the Horned Thundertiger. Save it for the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, it’s a violet item!” Qian Xiaoqian received it with a happy look on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any other missions? If not, then we’re going back to Black Tortoise City.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? So quickly?” Qian Xiaoqian put the staff away. “You’re not going to stay for a while longer? I’ll take you around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Fatty, why go back so quickly? Farming in Vermillion Bird City is the same. What’s more, Little Sister Pink is here too, and we won’t get so tired with girls around,” TheFugitive spoke shamelessly once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, HeadofGod and the others yanked TheFugitive to the side and beat him up before Fatty could even move his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve got a mission to do in Black Tortoise City, so I have to go back. Have fun here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I’m doing great here. Big Sister RainbowWatcher is my senior sister. She’s very nice to me. What’s more, most of the players in our guild are students at my school. Since I’ve also got the hidden class of Thunder Magus now, nobody would bully me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, that’s good,” Fatty turned to RainbowWatcher and chuckled the Tiger Saber and Windshattering Spear over. “Guild Master Rainbow, I’ll leave my little sister in your care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” RainbowWatcher also revealed a flower-like smile after receiving the two gold items, even if they couldn’t be used immediately. “Don’t worry, nobody would be able to bully Little Sister Beauty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good. Alright then, bros, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the thirteen rogues ripped apart a recall scroll each and teleported back to Black Tortoise City.</span></p>

 <p>Things have been a lot busier in real life than I would have liked them to be, but regardless I'm sure you guys don't care for the reasons. Either way, things are starting to settle down for me now, so I can indeed start posting properly again and play catch up like I intended to. I know it's not much, but let's start with 4 SMTM chapters today.</p>
