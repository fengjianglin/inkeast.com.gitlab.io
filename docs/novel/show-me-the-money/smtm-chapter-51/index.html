 <p><span style>Chapter 51 – Gary Ranks Up</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rosethorn had a terrible expression on her face when she heard the news, while MarchExtinction wanted to blow up the entire mine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild Master, although we didn’t get any Darksteel Ore, we got plenty of other ore. This place is a far better mining spot compared to the outside,” a female player stood up straight. She was very muscular, and if some other players saw her, they would definitely think “no wonder she chose Blacksmith as her secondary profession”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if it is a rich mine? Are you telling me that you want all of our sisters to not farm experience and just protect you girls as you mine?” Rosethorn waved her hand in annoyance. Her guild members instantly quieted down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild Master, this is all my fault,” MarchExtinction lowered her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I’m not blaming you for this. I didn’t plan to do anything to him originally, but since he dared to trick us, we won’t let him off,” Rosethorn comforted MarchExtinction. “He’s definitely still in here. Defend the cave and send our rogues out to search for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild Master, our people outside were attacked by the God Familia,” an urgent report sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God Familia? They dare to offend us? Sisters, come with me and slaughter them!” Rosethorn called out and led a squad charging to the entrance of the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty went offline to eat after killing some zombies, then logged back on to continue. When he counted the numbers of zombies more carefully, he noticed that there were only around two hundred, and he already killed more than half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep. His communicator sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grub, what’re you doing? You busy? You want to come and kill some players?” It was TheFugitive, who had disappeared off somewhere for the past two days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve been busy doing my mission. Who are you fighting?” Fatty responded as he played around with a Grudgeful Zombie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, of course it’s the Ice Rose Alliance. We’re just outside the Bat Cave,” TheFugitive responded excitedly, while a few curses could be heard from his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you guys fighting?” Fatty asked. </span><i><span style>Wow, TheFugitive was truly where the fun is every single time. I seem to recall that he was just chased out of Azure Dragon City by the Fierce Dragon Gang not so long ago…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why else? It’s because of some small matters related to the God Familia. It’s hard to explain. Come out quickly. You’ll be missing a lot if you’re late,” TheFugitive suddenly ended the chat, most likely because he started to join the fray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get out there? I do want to, but I don’t know the way,” Fatty muttered. The mini-map was completely dark, except where the old skeleton was. He was still able to vaguely remember the path he took when walking with Team Rose, but did not do that afterwards. He actually has no idea where he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>TheFugitive appeared as a cool and dull person on the outside, he was extremely wild on the inside. He would talk to Fatty every so often even while fighting and commented on which player was hot, which one had big boobs or which one had a bubble butt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Fatty slowly cleared away all the Grudgeful Zombies in the pit. In the end, there were only 198, so he needed to kill 802 to complete the side mission. What’s more, he also needed to light 991 torches to complete the main mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty looked up. The torch’s light dispersed the darkness in the cavern. He could see bats fly past occasionally, but no matter what he did, the bats seemed to refuse to come down into an area the torch illuminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few tries, he finally gave up and lit up one of his own torches to walk elsewhere. Soon, he found another mining pit. This mining pit was a lot smaller, and was only about a third of the size of the first one he found. There were only a few dozen Grudgeful Zombies within. After Fatty cleared them away, he lit up 3 more torches within the pit, and was one step closer to completing his mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next following days, Fatty spent his time in the Bat Cave. He killed enough Grudgeful Zombies already and lit up nine hundred something torches, and was merely a few dozen lit torches away from completing the mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the first day, when TheFugitive and the God Familia fought the Ice Rose Alliance outside, they were all killed. However, the Ice Rose Alliance did not end up well either. Not only thirtysomething members of Team Rose were killed, Rosethorn, one of the two guild masters of the Ice Rose Alliance, was killed by TheFugitive and LeftHandofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sadly, this also meant that TheFugitive lost another level just as he reached the last place on the leaderboards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty took a look at the minimap. Less than twenty percent of the mine was in darkness, and the rest were all illuminated. There was actually only a final section he didn’t go to yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past two days, aside from dealing with his biological emergencies, he spent the entire time during his mission. Not only did he nearly complete it, he even leveled up twice, reaching Level 23.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he carefully walked along the path and watched as the bats fly across his head, Fatty felt very fortunate. </span><i><span style>Thank god I chose rogue. If I chose any other class, it would already be very hard for me to get in here, not to mention completing the mission.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty walked around, he suddenly sensed a change in his inventory. He quickly opened it as saw that it was Gary, who turned into an egg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little fellow absorbed the inner core of its dad and turned into a pet egg again. Although it was silent the previous two days, it seemed to be on the verge of hatching again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty went over to a place illuminated by a torch and came out of stealth. He carefully placed the pet egg on the ground, then saw it wobble a bit before calming down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty waited for a while, but nothing happened. He thought about it what it meant, then sliced his finger again and dripped a few droplets of blood on the egg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crack appeared on the egg, followed by another, then another. An earthen yellow rat poked its head out and appeared in front of Fatty.</span></p>

 <p><i><span style>Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I never expected Gary to be able to rank up to a mid-rank yao! What’s more, all of its potential increased by 1 star. It’s already so amazing as a mid-rank yao… Just how strong would a high-rank yao be!? Or perhaps… a celestial beast or a divine beast!? </span></i><span style>Fatty didn’t even dare to imagine anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the fact that the rat was Level 0 once again after ranking up did make Fatty regret everything. </span><i><span style>I should have ascended it first. I wasted 2 days…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, you have ranked up now, so I shouldn’t call you Gary anymore. Alright, you’re yellow, so I’ll call you Wheat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dirt yellow Wheat squeaked twice signaling it understood, showing that it was actually smarter than Gary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty opened up Wheat’s status window. All of its skills were still around, but that were now altered. It’s inborn skill changed from Burrow into Earthwalk; Earth Bullet turned into Howling Bullet; while Size Alteration turned into Transmutation that would allow Wheat to not only change its size, but also change its form completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthwalk</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth attribute spell</span></p>
 <p><span style>The caster and move underground. During so, the user’s movement speed decreases by 80%, and can still attack enemies. Lasts permanently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Howling Bullet</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth attribute spell</span></p>
 <p><span style>Novice</span></p>
 <p><span style>Consume 3 mana to deal 60 damage</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cooldown: 0.5 seconds</span></p>
 <p><span style>Transmutation</span></p>
 <p><span style>Transform into anything the user has seen before. Consumes more mana the larger the being is. The user’s defense increases by 50% while transmuted, but cannot attack. Lasts permanently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cooldown: 24 hours</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Man, all of Wheat’s skills are insane. Earthwalk is such a good skill. No wonder Diggy Rat was appearing in all over the place, so this is the skill it had before.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty suppressed his excitement, then lured a Demonized Vampiric Bat over. He casted his fishing net over it and dragged the bet onto the ground and easily killed it. Wheat glowed, and leveled up, reaching Level 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, Earthwalk!” Fatty called out. Wheat dived into the ground and disappeared like a droplet of water reaching the ocean, leaving no trace behind at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Wheat could still move and attack was also great in Fatty’s mind. </span><i><span style>Although its slower, it’ll help me a lot for assassination or surprise attacks. </span></i><span style>Fatty had always thought that the child of a yao monster able to steal something from the palace much be rather strong, that was why he had giving up the Lightning Bird for it. Now, Wheat finally gave him a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, good boy.” </span><i><span style>Man, just what else could I ask for? </span></i><span style>Fatty called Wheat back out and patted its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat squeaked, then the system signaled him that Wheat’s loyalty towards him increased by 1 again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C’mon, Lord Fatty will take you farming,” with such a pet, Fatty put his mission to the side for the moment and went over to another place with a torch and less bats. He ordered Wheat stay behind and used the fishing net, which was already starting to break down, to start cashing bats to start farming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After killing a few dozen bats, Wheat reached Level 10, which would allow it to use its second skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty lured another bat over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, Earthwalk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rat disappeared in a split-second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, Howling Bullet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fist-sized earth bullet suddenly shot out from underneath the ground and hit the Demonized Vampiric Bat, dealing 10 damage with a crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty nodded. 10 damage on a Level 20 something monster as a Level 10 pet was pretty decent already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty went back to helping Wheat level up. After ranking up, Wheat now needed approximately a third more experience to level up before so. Thus, Fatty needed to use three days to finally help Wheat reach Level 20.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, Transmutation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat looked at Fatty dumbly without doing anything.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huh? </span></i><span style>Fatty took another look at the skill and noticed that Wheat needed something specific to turn into.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty pointed at a Demonized Vampiric Bat. “Wheat, Transmutation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dirt yellow aura surrounded wheat. Wheat’s mana bar quickly lowered and its body twisted within the aura. Thirty seconds later, Wheat the Rat disappeared and what replaced it was a Demonized Vampiric Bat called Wheat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, go and scout ahead,” Fatty directed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat flapped its wings, then started to run on the ground with its legs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, so it only gains the appearance, but it doesn’t gain the ability of the monster it transmuted into. No wonder it can’t attack after transmutation. </span></i><span style>Fatty told Wheat to return to its original appearance. </span><i><span style>This skill isn’t too bad. At least I can get it to turn into the Azure Dragon or White Dragon or something like that after seeing a monster like that, that’ll let me scared someone to death.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After leveling Wheat to level 20 and testing out all its new skills, he advanced excitedly towards the last area of darkness. </span><i><span style>Time for me to light the rest of the torches.</span></i></p>
