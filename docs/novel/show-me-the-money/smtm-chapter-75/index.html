 <p><span style>Chapter 75 – DragonSword</span></p>
 <p><span style>DragonSword’s attack timing was nearly perfect. It was timed precisely as TheFugitive turned around to walk away. Since his right foot hadn’t even landed on the ground yet, he was unable to dodge at all. What’s more, since rogues had lower attack, defense and health when compared to warriors, it was not worth it even if TheFugitive had immediately counterattacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only that, aside from DragonSword, the other Myriad Swords players behind him all made a move. The four hunters activated scattershot at the same time to ensure that TheFugitive couldn’t go into stealth using Invisibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if that was enough to hurt TheFugitive, then he would have lost his position on the assassin ranking list ages ago. As his foot met the ground, he immediately dove down. DragonSword’s blade thrust upwards, only piercing TheFugitive’s leather armor and just barely dealing a little bit of damage to him. In fact, the attack only dealt around a tenth of his health in damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, even though the hunters’ scattershot hit TheFugitive, since Scatter Shot dealt rather low damage, it didn’t cause TheFugitive much harm. TheFugitive only needed to drink one health potion to replenish all health he had lost.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So despicable!</span></i><span style> the onlookers couldn’t feel disdain when they saw DragonSword’s sudden attack. However, they did not voice their thoughts out loud due to their fear of Myriad Swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh. Wow. I can’t believe that the so-called Heavenly Mountain’s Seven Swords are merely people who only attack people behind their backs,” TheFugitive laughed coldly, without showing any rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can kill you without that,” DragonSword made a please gesture. “Now, let us fight fair and square. Let’s see how strong the 19</span><span style>th</span><span style> ranked expert is.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s so shameless! </span></i><span style>The onlookers cursed silently. </span><i><span style>Is he asking for a fair fight after his sneak attack failed? XuanYuanSword is a straightforward and chivalrous expert, why are his subordinates all so terrible!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>DragonSword laughed coldly. </span><i><span style>Fight alone? Why would anyone join a guild if they want to fight alone? Joining a build is so that you can bully others with numbers! </span></i><span style>After all, young masters like them always did that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Myriad Swords members have already forgotten that aside from TheFugitive, they were also against a Fatty who was no weaker than TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty immediately summoned Wheat when he saw TheFugitive get assaulted. He ordered Wheat to attack DragonSword when it gets a good opportunity, then snuck over in stealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Myriad Swords players noticed Fatty at the very beginning, but they immediately labeled Fatty as someone of no threat when they found out that Fatty didn’t even know about the All-Knowing Sect’s rankings. After all, that was a ranking even newbies knew about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>DragonSword looked at TheFugitive coldly, while the four hunters behind him spread out and aimed their bows towards TheFugitive. It was very clear that he planned to kill TheFugitive this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>TheFugitive chuckled coldly when he noticed Fatty disappear in stealth. “Fair fight? You sure you’re not going to ask those four dogs behind you for help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“TheFugitive, you really have a shitty mouth,” a hunter behind DragonSword cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said a fair fight, which means we are going to fight openly without any sneak attacks. You can’t be so childish as to think that I will fight you alone, right? Think about what era we’re in, I can’t believe you’re so foolish,” said DragonSword, while the hunters behind him laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So despicable, so shameless! </span></i><span style>The onlookers continued to curse silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Openly without any sneak attacks? That’s going to be tough,” TheFugitive shrugged. “That damn fatty only does sneak attacks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Damn fatty?” DragonSword immediately glanced over, but noticed that Fatty was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beware of an assassin,” DragonSword roared angrily, then used Night Blade Flurry around himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the moment DragonSword decided to use the skill, Fatty appeared behind a hunter and stabbed into the back of the hunter’s ribs before the latter could even realize what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh!” the hunter cried out in pain. Although he only lost some health, he did feel a bit of pain due to the nature of the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty flicked his dagger upwards, causing a stream of blood of gush out. The hunter screamed out in pain once more, then staggered back, unable to muster up the desire to counterattack at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attack!” DragonSword was outraged. They were the ones who should be doing the bullying and now they were being provoked. </span><i><span style>TheFugitive killing Humpdapanda was one thing, but this</span></i> <i><span style>fat ass actually dares to attack us? He’s seeking death!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The other three hunters quickly aimed at Fatty and shot a few arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty looked at DragonSword with a cold smile. He shook his body, then managed to dodge all of the arrows as he caught up to the hunter and activated Combo Attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skill only applied three hits this time. Every single time the dagger stabbed in and was pulled out, it brought out large volumes of blood. The hunter wailed and although it didn’t hurt that much, he couldn’t make himself counterattack when he saw the dagger move in and out of his body. Only one thought filled his mind and that was to get as far away from the fatty as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the dagger stabbed into the hunter for the final time, the hunter’s wish was finally granted. His health bar emptied out, so he could finally die and respawn back in town. When his corpse fell onto the ground, for some reason, the onlookers actually sensed that he was slightly relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill. Kill him!” DragonSword roared. He lost all his face after Fatty quickly dispatched a hunter right in front of him in public.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the moment DragonSword gave the orders, his body trembled. A dagger stabbed into his waist, and TheFugitive whispered into his ear, “You forgot about me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty used Invisibility and disappeared after killing the hunter. Meanwhile, DragonSword let out an angry roar after getting attacked. He raised his sword and hacked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save Big Brother Dragon!” the remaining three hunters disregarded Fatty and merely sent countless Explosive Shots, Scatter Shots, and Chain Shots down onto TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>TheFugitive felt a chill. He quickly activated Invisibility and shouted. “Brother Grub, hurry up. I’m going to die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it,” with that, Fatty appeared behind another hunter. This hunter hurriedly retreated, but Fatty chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Coil.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A silver python appeared and coiled itself around the hunter. The hunter’s expression turned stark white when he was informed by the system notification that he was going to be snared for 10 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty mercilessly killed that hunter and picked up a dropped legguard. Then, he sprinted towards the remaining hunters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two hunters were terrified. They stood side by side and couldn’t go and help DragonSword. They pulled their bows at the same time and attacked Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty’s body moved left and right like a butterfly as he ran, dodging most of the attacks shot his way.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s an expert! </span></i><span style>DragonSword’s expression turned to the worst when he saw that. </span><i><span style>This guy is definitely stronger than TheFugitive. Could he be someone in the top ten of the assassin ranking?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Losing your concentration is no good in PvP, ya’ know?” TheFugitive snuck over once more and stabbed DragonSword’s thigh. After that, he quickly moved back. “Ahh, sorry. Oops. My bad, I didn’t mean to stab that place. Sorry, sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As TheFugitive retreated, a few bullets of earth shot forth and landed on the body part TheFugitive was referring to. That was Wheat making use of the opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You fools, why aren’t you attacking!?” DragonSword was furious when he saw the players who wanted to fight Fatty and TheFugitive initially being frozen in fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn fat ass. Don’t get cocky. I’ll take you on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One sword to immortality!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those Myriad Swords members shouted. </span><i><span style>Is that warrior’s attack even going to hit me when I’m several dozen meters away from him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty sprinted forth, the two hunters realized that it was impossible to pull their distance. They gritted their teeth, put away their bows and took out a dagger each, before leaping at Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s more like it. Close combat is the real way to go,” Fatty bullshitted as he moved around. Although the two hunters were rather fast, they couldn’t catch up to Fatty. Fatty only would always attack once then quickly retreat, denying them any chance of counter attacking. Thus, after a few rounds, both hunters lost more than half their health, while Fatty still remained unscathed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing, just who is this fatty? Why is he even stronger than TheFugitive?” the female player who was chatting with Fatty was completely shocked. Although Fatty was only facing a few average players, it was clear from his timing and skill usage that he was very strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could he be an expert above TheFugitive on the assassin rankings? Oh, dammit. I chatted with him for so long, but I still don’t know his name! Mm, I’ll go and get some more information from him later, and see if he might join us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty didn’t know what the pretty Minister of Intelligence was thinking. At that moment, he moved between the two hunters and sent one of them sprawling with a kick. Then, he swung his dagger at the other, causing a long laceration on that hunter, finishing off his health bar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hunter fell down onto the ground and turned into a ray of white light. The other hunter ran back quickly, but Fatty chuckled. He lifted his left hand and a quick pillar of light shot towards the person’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hunter was pierced through by the arrow, then fell down after a few staggers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it’s just us now,” Fatty disregarded the few players who only dared to speak arrogantly, and did not dare to approach, then turned towards DragonSword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, you are good. I wonder which expert on the assassin rankings are you?” DragonSword took a deep breath, replenished his health, then crossed his sword in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Assassin ranking? Ahh, I’m not lucky enough to be on it,” Fatty sighed begrudgingly. “Fuge, let’s fight together so we can end this quickly. We have proper business to attend to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>DragonSword’s face turned stark white. It really seemed like he would have to drop a level. Just as he was about to talk some more trash, someone shouted out at the city gate. “Brother Grubber, Fuge, don’t kill him. Wait for me!”</span></p>

 <p><strong>Rando C:&nbsp;</strong>Tch, all of them are like that. I really don't know how a great guild master like XuanYuanSword has such terrible subordinates.</p>
 <p><strong>Rando A:</strong> Shhh, do you want to get murdered?</p>

 <p><strong>TheFugitive:&nbsp;</strong>Okay, fine. You're dead. You're f*cking dead, you little shameless piece of.</p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 2 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
