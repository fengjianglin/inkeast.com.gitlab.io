 <p><span style>Chapter 70 – Another Boss Monster</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, what should we…” LeftHandofGod asked quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be in such a hurry,” HeadofGod looked around. “No matter what, Money Grubber’s our friend. Since he’s our friend, we should go screw.. ugh, no, I mean, go help even if we get screwed. We’ll help him escape when necessary. Eagle Fortress? Who the heck do they think they are!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spread out. A player every two meters and surround this place. Use AoE attacks at where you stand and don’t let him sneak out,” FlyingEagle ordered calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stealth was a powerful skill that the rogues had at their disposal, but it did have their weaknesses, and that was the fact that they couldn’t attack and had a massive decrease in movement speed. Normally speaking, Fatty would have already ran out of the Eagle Fortress’s attack range, but while in stealth, Fatty could only run inwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right, Fatty hid into the Minotaur Chieftain’s cave. Since more than two hours have passed, a lot of minotaurs have already been refreshed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty originally thought about placing a few traps in the tunnel of the cave so that it would cause some damage to the Eagle Fortress members who entered, but finally decided against it when he saw the minotaurs respawning.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh, Darkthorn was damn annoying. It probably was FlyingEagle’s orders. That guy probably sent Darkthorn to challenge me, it would be for the best if Darkthorn could beat me, and even if Darkthorn couldn’t, he could at least make my name red so I can’t use a Recall Scroll.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm, he was pretty strong, at least he dodged quite a few of my attacks. He’s nearly as good as TheFugitive, and is even better than some players in God Familia.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty walked over to where the Minotaur Chieftain slept and felt a stench gush towards his face. It was something his brain just didn’t notice the previous time while the Snowsilver Grass was still around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was nothing too special about where the Minotaur Chieftain slept. If there was anything out of the ordinary, it was how dry the ground was, since normally speaking, areas without any sunlight shining through would usually be very humid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty thought back &nbsp;and recalled that Diggy Rat’s hole was also very dry. However, he attributed that to Diggy Rat being capable of earth magic. </span><i><span style>I wonder how the Minotaur Chieftain did it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty looked down at the ground, then immediately thought of something. </span><i><span style>There’s definitely something special about this place for the Snowsilver Grass to grow here. </span></i><span style>He took out Blacksmith’s Tool, then begun to swing at the ground, and eventually got a piece of rock out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Congratulations. You have mined an iron ore. +0.01% EXP to Mining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty couldn’t help but gasp. </span><i><span style>It’s this hard to level up mining from Advance to Master? I’m only getting 0.01% of the EXP needed to level up the skill after harvesting an iron ore?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mining probably wouldn’t have gotten any experience if I was already at the Master level for it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Eagle Fortress slowly tightened their encirclement, while their players repeatedly casted skills by their sides. It was so frequent that even a mosquito in stealth would be revealed. Soon, they ended up circling the entrance of the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, does he think that he can leave after going in there?” FlyingEagle laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortress Master, let me lead our brothers in and slaughter him,” BlackEagle nominated himself. He was already filled with rage when the boss monster they worked so hard fighting was stolen. Since he knew that they couldn’t do anything to do the God Familia, he could only take it out on Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful,” FlyingEagle merely told him to be careful. As the Fortress Master, FlyingEagle did need to let his subordinates vent out their anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, BlackEagle led his people into the cave with a cold laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He went into the cave? That’s not a good idea,” said LeftWingofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not really. If he just goes offline in the cave, then is Eagle Fortress going to wait here for him their entire life?” asked LeftHandofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He won’t do that,” HeadofGod answered. “If he goes and hides offline just because of such a tiny matter, then it really isn’t worth us helping him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty didn’t know what other people were saying about him outside the cave, but he was having the time of his life. The ores here were even more plentiful than at the mine. He could get iron ores every three to five rocks he mined out, and there were quite a few bronze and aluminum ores as well. In just the short period of time, Fatty already mined out over forty iron ore, twelve bronze ores and two aluminum ores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty had no doubt that if he continues to mine, advance ores like Darksteel ores would not be rare either, and he might even be able to mine out other strange ores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Fatty finally ran out of time. When he heard the laughter of the players outside and the roars of the Minotaur Guards, Fatty knew that the Eagle Fortress had located him. He put away his pickaxe and returned to stealth and summoned Wheat back out. Wheat’s black eyes seemed to twinkle as it listened to Fatty’s orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As BlackEagle led his subordinates forward, not only did they killed every single minotaur, they also cast spells and used skills on the ground around them to prevent Fatty getting behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After clearing all the monsters, BlackEagle and co. arrived at the innermost of the cave, and saw a huge minotaur lying there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The minotaur was three to four times larger than normal ones. Its body was bright red, and a huge axe rested underneath its head. It was deep in sleep with its legs crossed. At that moment, it was awakened by the commission BlackEagle and co. made. It opened its bell-like eyes in displeasure and swept its gaze over them with disdain. BlackEagle was so close that the hot air from the minotaur’s nostrils seemed to land right on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss! It’s a boss monster!” BlackEagle was already familiar with all of the Minotaur Chieftain’s characteristics after a lengthy battle, and the axe underneath its head was what brought about the end of many of the Eagle Fortress players.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!” BlackEagle shouted, and cast a skill on the Minotaur Chieftain as he retreated. As long as he could lure the monster out, he was certain that they could easily kill it with everyone outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, BlackEagle retreated too quickly, so he didn’t notice that the skill actually took away a small chunk of HP from the Minotaur Chieftain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*cking hell. If you’re going to retreat, then just do it, why the heck did you attack!?” Fatty cursed softly, then ran out behind BlackEagle with the Minotaur Chieftain holding its axe and strolling behind them</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortress Master, there’s a situation. There’s another Minotaur Chieftain inside. It’s coming out now, so prepare to attack,” BlackEagle took out his communicator and shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>FlyingEagle was shocked, “What? Two bosses? I’ve never heard of two bosses living together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They might be a couple,” someone suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, get ready. Immediately attack when the boss comes out. Do not let it use any skills,” FlyingEagle directed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortress Master, but what about Money Grubber?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill the boss monster first,” FlyingEagle said resolutely. “We can kill Money Grubber any time, but not the boss monster. Although the God Familia has very few people, and they’re all rogues. I’m certain that they will definitely suffer fewer losses than us if they went to kill the boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>FlyingEagle looked warily at God Familia. If it wasn’t because they were so powerful, FlyingEagle would definitely not allow them to leave considering that he had so many players with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortress Master, it’s here. Hurry,” BlackEagle led his people out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eagle Fortress members immediately raised their weapons, the mages began to chant their spells, and the rogues started to lay down traps at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since stealth decreased movement speed, when Fatty arrived at the cave entrance, he accidentally stepped on a trap before he could realize what was going on. Two vines grew up form the ground and entwined around his feet, causing him to be knocked out of stealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Money Grubber? Kill him!” FlyingEagle was momentarily shocked, then he immediately gave the orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop, the boss monster is coming. What are you guys still hitting me for?” Fatty cursed righteously. “What’s more important? Killing the boss, or fighting amongst ourselves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not too late to kill the boss monster after we kill you. Ready…” FlyingEagle laughed coldly, and just as he was about to give the order to fire…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground trembled, and a boss monster seemingly more powerful than the previous Minotaur Chieftain walked out. It seemed to be rather confused as it put it axe into the ground and looked at the players in front of it dumbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attack the boss! Attack!” somebody shouted. The spells that were originally aimed towards Fatty immediately fired on the Minotaur Chieftain. It was clear that most players preferred to kill boss monsters instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn they’re lucky, there’s actually another boss monster,” LeftHandofGod cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>HeadofGod didn’t respond and merely frowned. He found the whole situation very weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet… to everybody’s surprise, before the differently attacks landed on the monster, the “more powerful” Minotaur Chieftain actually turned around and ran back into the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going?” Everyone was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>FlyingEagle immediately noticed something amiss. “Chase it. There’s something wrong with the monster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortress Master, you guys chase. I’ll send Money Grubber back home,” BlackEagle laughed, then leaped towards Fatty with his saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“OMG, another boss!” Fatty exclaimed as he pointed behind BlackEagle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>BlackEagle quickly turned around, but didn’t see a boss monster. There wasn’t even anything behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idiot,” Fatty sneered. He finally cut through the vines around his legs. He leaped out and sent BlackEagle flying with a kick, then quickly ran off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase! Chase him!” BlackEagle immediately led a few subordinates and chased after Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After running few a meters, Fatty suddenly muttered quietly. “Ahh, you poor thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He summoned a small rat with less than 1% of its health remaining, then put it back in his pet inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The boss is gone!? How can the boss disappear!? Find it! FIND IT!” FlyingEagle’s roar sounded out in the team chat. However, FlyingEagle quietly turned quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wheat, it was all thanks to you this time. Lord Fatty will definitely help you find a female rat later. Mm, a beautiful female rat. I promise.</span></i><span style> Fatty thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty ran further and further away, he did try to hop into stealth, but BlackEagle clearly became smarter. He had two archers by him at all times, and whenever Fatty disappeared, he would get them to fire several shots, eventually wasting both of Fatty’s stealth chances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Money Grubber, let’s see where you’re going to run this time!” BlackEagle gritted his teeth. </span><i><span style>If I let him run this time, then I should just kill myself.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase me if you can,” Fatty shouted and dashed down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, I guess our help isn’t needed,” LeftHandofGod laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>HeadofGod nodded lazily, “Ahh, there’s nothing to do here. Let’s leave. We should go and farm, then take a look out how well the Ice Rose Alliance’s beauties developed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A round of lecherous laughter sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Fatty ran and ran and ran, a few people suddenly appeared in front of him and blocked his path.</span></p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 2 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
