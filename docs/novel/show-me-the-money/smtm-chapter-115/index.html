 <p><span style>Chapter 115 – Wraith Swamp</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragonslayer Saber was an expert in PvP, he quickly brought his saber up to meet the attack just as Fatty attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Fatty had been waiting for the chance for a very long time. He was not going to waste the opportunity. He twisted his hand, moving the dagger around the black saber and stabbed Dragonslayer Saber’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-390</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dagger nearly pierced through the entirety of its target’s neck. Although Dragonslayer Saber still had plenty of health left, he did take significant damage and was still suffering from a bleed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty did not pull the dagger out. Instead, he pulled it sideways and cutting through Dragonslayer Saber’s neck, leaving a small bit of flesh and skin connecting the head and the neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an instakill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the battle resolution resolved primarily on damage calculations, a fatal attack that basically looped off a player’s head meant that it was an instakill regardless of the level difference, health and levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Fatty had not yet gotten his class enhancement, he was Level 30, so he possessed a large item advantage against Dragonslayer Saber, whose items were only in the 20s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not wait around after killing his target either and just turned around and activated Invisibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rogues, detection!” A warrior beside Dragonslayer Saber shouted. The various warriors also targeted their skills at where Fatty disappearance from like madmen, but nothing was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Dragonslayer Saber’s dead. Time for us to counterattack!” Fierce Dragon TheTalent was infuriated from Dragonslayer Saber’s verbal assault and the situation of the battles. Now that his enemy was dead and their formations started to scatter, he immediately rallied his group of twenty-something people and charged forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay calm. We outnumber them, so let us kill Fierce Dragon TheTalent to take revenge for our boss!” Zhuge Marvelous shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing his calls, the slightly chaotic Dragonslayers members calmed down a little and charged towards their foes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!” Fierce Dragon TheTalent pulled his group back when he saw his enemies react. Since Dragonslayer Saber was already dead. He knew that it was a victory as long as he kept himself alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle ended as quickly as it started. Despite Zhuge Marvelous’s best efforts, the Dragonslayers players quickly lost their fighting spirit and retreated under the orders of the various squad captains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got lucky this time. C’mon, let’s go,” Zhuge Marvelous shouted out before leading the last of his dispirited guildmates away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, some of the Fierce Dragon Gang’s reinforcements also arrived on the Wildfire Plains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my god, my name’s red again,” Fatty came out of stealth with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, thanks a bunch,” Fierce Dragon TheTalent walked over. If it wasn’t for Fatty killing Dragonslayer Saber, he really might have died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome. Let’s go back and see what’s going on with the boss monster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mad Bull King only had a third of its health remaining. The God Familia were on the verge of slaying the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of the number one assassin familia!” Fatty praised. He could tell that all of them had top class mechanics, while HeadofGod was the cream of the crop, which allowed him to narrowly dodge many attacks flung his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, after a long two hours battle, God Familia finally killed the Mad Bull King after eight deaths. Unfortunately, it did not drop a Guild Establishment Token. They also received news that the Flying Rang Gang ambushed Fierce Dragon Sweetheart’s team of players and in the midst of their intense battle, a small unknown guild managed to steal the kill on the boss monster. However, just like the Mad Bull King, the Pegasus King didn’t drop a Guild Establishment Token.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the God Familia had a lot of jobs to do with various guilds hiring them to kill boss monsters after boss monsters, after they finished the transaction with Fierce Dragon TheTalent, they quickly left to do their next one. TheFugitive also went along with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that everything quieted down, Fatty suddenly felt it was rather boring. </span><i><span style>Guild wars, killing people… Aren’t they sick of it all? I don’t see how much fun it is to fight players. Whatever, I’ll just go and do my mission.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His most important job right now was getting his class enhancement, so he had to search for a Dragon Revolution Herb. While he could actually just get another class enhancement mission in Azure Dragon City, Fatty still felt like he should do the one he got from the rogue mentor in the Imperial Capital. After all, the mentor did tell him to do the mission before getting his class enhancement, so that means that he should be rewarded with a boost of some sort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Fatty asked Fierce Dragon TheTalent for information. TheTalent asked around his guild, but nobody knew where the Dragon Revolution Herb was. In fact, it was their first time even hearing of the name. Fatty had 7 days to do the mission and nearly half of the time was gone. </span><i><span style>I only have a bit more than three days left to do the mission. If I don’t find the herb, then I’ll be wasting this opportunity.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the All-Knowing Sect was a thing. After paying a hefty price of five thousand gold coins, Fatty was able to find out the approximate location of what might be a Dragon Revolution Grass. It was around two hundred and fifty kilometers east of Azure Dragon City in a place called Wraith Swamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty nearly fainted in anger when he heard the five thousand gold coins cost. However, he still caved in in the end and paid Bai Xiaosheng093 for the information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something to be noted was how Fatty seemed fated to clash with the undead. He killed countless skeletal soldiers in Mass Graves when he first arrived in Black Tortoise City; after he arrived in the Imperial Capital, he went over to the Ancient Battlefield, which was filled with all sorts of undead; now? He had to go and chat with some wraiths… Undead again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty wasted no time after getting the location. He sprinted through everything with Wheat all the way over to the Wraith Swamp. It was a deathly swamp covering several squared kilometers. A myriad of animal bones would occasionally float up from the bottom as if to remind people that there were hardly any life within at all. Perhaps it was due to this that no players farmed in the area. The only thing that moved was the Vengeful Skeletons that patrolled the shores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vengeful Skeleton</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 33</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>One poor skeleton walked the shores with a saber in its hand. A large skull balanced on top of a thin neck as it turned around in search of it. </span><i><span style>Oh dear, it really might lose its head if it’s not careful!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, go!” Fatty ordered. Wheat immediately turned back to the size of a small calf and pounced at the Vengeful Skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster fell on the ground. Before it could realize what was going on, Wheat bit down on its neck, achieving the same thing that Fatty did when he killed Dragonslayer Saber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skull rolled a few steps away, then rolled back and stared at Fatty from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Squeak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat leaped up in fright and dashed back to Fatty with anxious squeaks as if it was saying “Ahhh, a ghost! Run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop squeaking!” Fatty kicked Wheat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat quietened down and looked over at the monster, only to see it reach its boney hands out and grab its skull, then press it down on its neck with a crack. After making sure that its skull was once again secured onto its neck, the Vengeful Skeleton wobbled up without any hints of its head having been lopped off earlier at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the monster picked up its saber again before walking towards Fatty. While it advanced, it cackled in what was seemingly complaint of Wheat’s violence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat wasn’t going to take any of that. It shot a Howling Bullet at the Vengeful Skeleton, forcing it a few steps backwards as a -213 rose up from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continue,” Fatty had grown a lot lazier ever since he got Wheat. He would very often just poke and kick Wheat a bit and not worry about the actual fight at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat was clearly very pissed about getting shocked by the Vengeful Skeleton. It slammed its claws down on the ground without Fatty’s orders and sent ten-odd stalagmites up from the ground to send the Vengeful Skeleton into the air, dealing another good chunk of damage to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Wheat shot a Howling Bullet at it again, once again displaying its might. Although the Vengeful Skeleton was a Level 33 monster, it was still completely destroyed before it could even reach Wheat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good boy, I’ll give you a reward,” Fatty patted Wheat’s head. Indeed, that was Wheat’s reward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Vengeful Skeleton fell down into a pile, it dropped a pile of what was seemingly rubbish. When Fatty checked through it, his eyes lit up. There was a piece of a map!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Door of Misfortune Map: 1/100. Open the Door of Misfortune and enter the Paradise of Misfortune. Be careful, it’s dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I need to collect 100 of these to complete the map? Hmm, I wonder what the Door of Misfortune and Paradise of Misfortune is. Whatever, it’s definitely something good. </span></i><span style>Fatty put the map away carefully, then started to lead Wheat into battle excitedly. </span><i><span style>Whatever it is, I’ll just gather enough first!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That one. Yes, that’s the one. Hurry up,” Fatty commanded on a slanted tree. Meanwhile, Wheat was shooting Howling Bullets at a Vengeful Skeleton. Since Fatty was sitting a few meters above ground, the Vengeful Skeleton’s saber couldn’t reach him, it could only try to jump, hack and fail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another Vengeful Skeleton fell down. Fatty took a look at the drops. </span><i><span style>Ahh, nothing good again. </span></i><span style>He didn’t even want to pick it up anymore. It was clear that the Door of Misfortune Map drop rate was extremely low and the first one might have just been the RNG trying to bait him. After such a long time of farming, he only gathered two pieces in total.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty pointed at a distant Vengeful Skeleton and ordered Wheat to continue, then prepared himself to lie down for a nap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Splash!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Wheat attracted the attention of the Vengeful Skeleton, a monster leaped out of the swamp and swallowed the top half of the Vengeful Skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my! Those ribs actually taste something!?” Fatty leaped up and watched as the monster gobble the lower half of the Vengeful Skeleton down before disappearing back into the swamp.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder they said that the swamp is dangerous. So that’s why. </span></i><span style>Fatty didn’t notice any sort of monster like that previously at all. </span><i><span style>Thank god I didn’t go near the water, otherwise… Even half of Wheat’s big ass would have been beaten off.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty turned his head. As he expected, Wheat was hugging the trunk of the tree he was on tightly and making a clear expression that it wasn’t going to go anywhere near the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch,” Fatty clicked his tongue, then climbed off and sneaked over to the side of the swamp. The water was very muddy, so one could not see how deep it was or what was in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, come over here,” Fatty pointed at there the monster disappeared from. “Cast Scatterstone Rain!”</span></p>
