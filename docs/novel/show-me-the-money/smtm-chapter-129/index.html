 <p><span style>Chapter 129 – The Fisherman</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dryad boss monster wrapped its humongous body together like a budding flower and all the attacks that landed on it dealt only 10% of the damage they were supposed to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch,” River Scholar snickered when he saw the results. </span><i><span style>If this is all the monster is capable of, then it will die very soon.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mm, it’s Lord Fatty’s turn. Now… Where should I attack?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty thought to himself as he stealthed forward. He was at quite a distance from the valley to avoid the dryad boss monster’s attack. However, if he just bluntly charged out, then he would most likely be killed before he reached there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless fire spells landed on the dryad boss monster. For some reason, the monster remained stationary.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is so weird, even if the boss monster doesn’t have an advanced AI, it shouldn’t be so dumb as to just let us attack it without fighting back? </span></i><span style>The players thought to themselves. </span><i><span style>But not fighting back is always better.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a final barrage from the mages, the dryad boss monster finally exploded, leaving a floor of items.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s it? </span></i><span style>River Scholar didn’t quite understand what happened when he saw his subordinates began to collect the items. </span><i><span style>This is a Level 50 gold boss monster, why did it only drop such trash? There wasn’t even a gold item!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you guys hide any?” River Scholar glanced around in suspicion. The surrounding players quickly shook their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only such trash dropped after we wasted over four hours and suffered five hundred something deaths!?” River Scholar laughed in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Fatty wasn’t sure if he was supposed to laugh or cry. He wanted to stealth closer to fight over the items. But a small tree popped up beside a tree near him right as he entered the valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tree was only a bit over a meter high with ten-odd branches that had hints of being burnt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A small tree beside a large one was not surprising. What made Fatty notice it was because it popped up from beneath his bottom and pushed him to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the f*ck!?” Fatty was shocked to be knocked out of stealth. Even though he used Invisibility immediately, he was still noticed in the split second that he was invisible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was that!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rogues, detect. Other people, attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few rogues immediately used Detect in the area, while various spells and arrows soared towards Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty rolled away from the attacks, but still ended up revealing himself in the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the heat of the moment, Fatty used Disguise, changing his appearance temporarily and giving himself a random name for the duration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild Master, there’s a boss here!” A player exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Boss? </span></i><span style>Fatty glanced over and used Appraisal, displaying the stats of the tiny tree near him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heart of the Dryad Commander</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silver Boss</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 40</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Notes: The Dryad Commander stationed in the Greenery Mountains was forced to leave its main body behind with its heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder the dryad boss monster didn’t fight back, so it was hiding here. Man, it really might have been able to escape if it didn’t prod me in the ass.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a shame. Today will mark the death of the dryad boss.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the River Alliance players rushed over and surrounded Fatty and Heart of the Dryad Commander when they heard that the boss monster was over there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile bloomed on River Scholar’s face when he heard the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, good. Very good. Although it downgraded to a silver boss with 10 less levels, everything was worth it as long as it drops what we need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello,” Fatty greeted the River Alliance players. At that moment, he and the boss monster were each leaning on the side of a tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>River Scholar turned towards Fatty after checking out the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m passing by. Just passing by. Haha,” Fatty forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>River Scholar’s mouth twitched as he gave an order, “Rogues, use Detect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several skills landed on Fatty, removing the effects of Transform and showing who he really was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Money Grubber?” River Scholar muttered, then a spark of light flashed across his eyes. “You are Money Grubber who sold the City Construction Token to Icy?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Icy? They sound close. </span></i><span style>Fatty was not surprised that River Scholar knew him. He had overheard Dragonslayer Saber say that the River Alliance was merely a subsidiary alliance to the Ice Rose Alliance, it was normal for the guild masters to know each other. Thus, it was natural for him to know about the sale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you know her. We’re all on the same side. Haha,” Fatty chuckled and took a few steps forward, then quickly retreated at the sight of several knights point their lances at him. He was certain that countless holes would appear in his body if he took a few steps forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Same side? Heh,” River Scholar snorted in disdain and pointed at Fatty. “Kill him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the players immediately raised their weapons, while the mages began to cast their spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!” Fatty put his hands up and called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else could it be?” River Scholar smirked in enjoyment of Fatty’s frightened look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you not curious about why I’m here?” Fatty stared at River Scholar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, they're a bunch of people coming and going here. There are plenty of people who try to steal kills on boss monsters and grab a few items. It wouldn’t be a surprise for anybody to be here,” River Scholar replied coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re wrong,” Fatty put his hands down and stuck up his chest. “I am just passing by. I’m sure you guys know about where I’m going too. It’s the place where the advance boss – the Ancient Camphor Tree Spirit is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ancient Camphor Tree Spirit? Brat, don’t tell me that there’s a legendary item there and you’re going to kill the monster for that,” River Scholar laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you know!?” Fatty revealed a look of false shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? There really is a legendary item there?” River Scholar was momentarily stunned. Then he laughed. “We won’t be able to get it even if it’s there. I’m sure you know about how strong advance boss monsters are, six major guilds are still stuck on the fifth floor of Mass Graves. Alright, just shut up and prepare for your death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wrong. We will definitely able to get a legendary item when we get over,” Fatty said firmly. He took something out from his inventory. “Take a look at what that is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A egg-sized ball appeared in Fatty’s hands. It was fiery red like ruby with red smoke swirling within. Heat seemed to rise up from it, forming what appeared to be small clouds above it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s that? It’s beautiful,” a female player’s eyes lit up at the sight of that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This? It’s a Thunderfire Power Bomb! He used it to kill a Level 50 low rank yao. Ill him!” River Scholar ordered frantically as he retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Babe, don’t go!” Fatty called out coquettishly, then slammed the Thunderfire Power Bomb down at his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deliberately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red mushroom cloud rose up with a huge bang. The explosion soared up into the clouds and covered the entire valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of screams sounded out, instantly killing many of the River Alliance players and heavily wounding the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heart of the Dryad Commander, who was the closest to Fatty, naturally turned into smithereens after being hit by the center of the explosion. The items it dropped also ended up scattering into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: The criteria for Death Transformation has been reached. Would you like to transform?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh hell yeah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty immediately chose “yes”. Black smoke surrounded up. Fatty’s shattered body parts writhed and crawled along the ground. A few seconds later, an undead marshal clad in bronze armor riding a tall skeletal horse appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, now, where is the skill book?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty randomly distributed his stat points and ignored the notification about naming. He looked around and saw that the explosion was still spreading, leaving the ground covered in equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, he noticed a green skill book on the ground lying several meters in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, a skill book!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blood-covered player roared and pounced towards the skill book at the same time Fatty saw the skill book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking for it!” Fatty was outraged. He pulled his lance back and shot it forwards like a throwing lance. At the same time, he pulled on the skeletal horse’s reins and urged it forwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bronze lance pinned the player on the ground through at his ribs just as his fingers touched the skill book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My… skill… book…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The player struggled a little. His fingers wavered before he closed his eyes and turned into white light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty bent down and picked the skill book up. He laughed loudly when he saw the name of the skill book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I finally got it,” Fatty laughed with a smug. His mission at the Azure Dragon City was complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop worrying. Stay calm. Drink pots. Rally together and don’t let Money Grubber get away,” River Scholar’s called sounded out from afar. Smoke still filled the surroundings so Fatty couldn’t see River Scholar’s state. However, he felt like River Scholar shouldn’t have been too injured due to how fast he had sprinted away before Fatty threw the bomb at his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty had no choice but to do that. If he didn’t kill himself first, the explosion of the bomb would kill too many people and make his name red. That would prevent him from returning to town for a long time. His first priority was to kill the Heart of the Dryad Commander before the River Alliance did and gran the skill book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, he was finally able to let out a sigh of relief and got to work. He quickly picked up an item shining with a green light from the ground, then used Harvest on what was left on the monster’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A damaged piece of wood around half a meter appeared in Fatty’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mission accomplished. Time to take my leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skeletal horse neighed, then sprinted off with Fatty.</span></p>
