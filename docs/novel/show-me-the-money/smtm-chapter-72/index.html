 <p><span style>Chapter 72 – News on Qian Xiaoqian</span></p>
 <p><span style>Any men would be beyond envious when they saw Rosethorn hugging Fatty with such a smile. Of course, that was excluding the men on scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty’s in danger,” LeftHandofGod said lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rosethorn set her eyes on him. Ahh, he needs to be careful, or he’ll be filled with holes,” RightEyeofGod said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of God Familia all looked at RightEyeofGod with a chuckle, then continue to watch everything unfold silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a sporty figure quickly ran through the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” That person stopped in his tracks and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap, it’s Fuge,” HeadofGod quickly turned on his communicator. “Fuge, be careful, don’t let the Ice Rose Alliance women see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” TheFugitive quickly replied. “What’s Fatty doing with them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a looooong story,” HeadofGod replied and started to tell TheFugitive the story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauties of the Ice Rose Alliance, thank you for your aid. Otherwise, this one was definitely going to be dead,” Fatty pulled his arm away with a chuckle and thanked Rosethorn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not really. If we didn’t come, then Brother Grubber would definitely be back in Black Tortoise City already,” Rosethorn smiled. Fatty was very fortunate that Ice Rose Alliance was female players only, otherwise, the male players behind Rosethorn would already be pissed at Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what does the beautiful Rose ask of this one? If there isn’t anything, then I’ll be off now. I still need to clean myself of this red name. Haha,” Fatty pointed at the red name above his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow, men. You’re all so terrible. I heard you were in danger, so I led my people over to save you, but y-you… You actually… Ahh,” Rosethorn said begrudgingly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, what on earth!? </span></i><span style>Fatty didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, but her response only made him feel like he had to be more careful. </span><i><span style>There definitely was more to it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Fatty received a call in the communicator. He listened intently, then replied “Alright, I’ll be there immediately” very softly before hanging up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Is Brother Grubber very busy?” A light flashed across Rosethorn’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, a friend’s asking me for help with a small thing,” Fatty chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then can I come too? Although my level is really low, I’m pretty strong you know?” Rosethorn said coquettishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… There’s no need for that, I can handle it myself. Bye bye you beauties,” Fatty nodded towards Ice Witch, then immediately sprinted off into a distance before Rosethorn could say anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit!” Rosethorn’s expression worsened when Fatty left. She thought about it for a moment, then suddenly turned towards Ice Witch. “Lil’ Sis, did Big Sister turn ugly? Why didn’t it seem like I attracted him at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t turn ugly. That fatty just had no taste,” Ice Witch said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, Lil’ Sis truly knows what to say,” Rosethorn giggled, then hugged Ice Witch’s arm. “Why do you want to get along with that fatty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has ties with Fierce Dragon TheTalent and a lot of other guild masters. I need information on them,” Ice Witch replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Fatty ran off for awhile, he saw TheFugitive and the God Familia standing there and looked at him with sleazy smiles on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, why do I notice lecherous smiles on your faces whenever I see you guys?” Fatty sat down on a boulder in a very speechless manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s because we cannot help but smile lecherously when we are facing the lecherous you,” they all laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grub, what sort of excuse did you use to escape from that rose beauty?” TheFugitive asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told them that I was going to get you guys to go and kill an advanced boss monster,” Fatty came up with a random excuse. Then, he suddenly asked. “Say, do you think we can kill the advance boss monster in Greenery Mountain when we’re all Level 30?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grub, why are you always thinking about that boss? That boss is impossible to be killed by normal people!” TheFugitive said speechlessly. “You probably don’t know this yet, but the White Horse Gang, which is the unofficial fourteenth guild is Black Tortoise City led a crusade against the Phantom Messenger on the fifth floor of Mass Graves, but all one thousand of them died twice, and they couldn’t do anything about the Phantom Messenger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, that boss was that amazing?” Fatty exclaimed. They were really low leveled then, so they didn’t get a true glimpse of how terrifying an advanced boss monster can be. Now, it really does seem like all of them getting killed then was nothing special.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s why you should stop thinking about the advanced boss monsters for now. The Mass Graves one is alright, since it isn’t particularly high leveled, but you need to at least reach this level before you have a chance against the one in Greenery Mountains,” TheFugitive raised his palm up and showed Fatty a ‘five’.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Level 50…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s farm first,” Fatty said in a troubled manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuge, which beauty were you working so hard to kill a monster for?” HeadofGod asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wasn’t helping a beauty kill monsters, somebody just used a thousand gold coins and hired me to help that girl do a mission. Say, that girl was truly beautiful. My heart was moving even when killing monsters, ya’ know!” TheFugitive said exaggeratedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So beautiful? Could they even be more beautiful than the two pretty guild masters of the Ice Rose Alliance?” Fatty twitched his mouth in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, she was even more beautiful than them,” TheFugitive covered his chest with his hands and looked up into the sky. “That beauty is called Pink Beauty. Ahh, people are really like their name. My heart…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty choked and spoke and coughed several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say she was called? Pink Beauty?” Fatty interrupted TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, what?” TheFugitive was very annoyed at having his fantasy interrupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty ignored him and called someone he had never spoked to in-game before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Qian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Bro?” Qian Xiaoqian’s surprised voice sounded out. “How do you have time to contact me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from some things concerning principles, Fatty pretty much never interfered with Qian Xiaoqian’s life. Even when playing this game, they haven’t had any contact barring the time they added each other to their friend list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did a sleazy looking guy called TheFugitive help you with a mission recently?” asked Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Qian Xiaoqian said after a short consideration. “What? Bro, do you know him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s a friend of mine. He just mentioned you. Haha, he said you are really beautiful,” Fatty chuckled, then chatted a bit more with Qian Xiaoqian before hanging up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grub, Fatbro, my dearest brother,” TheFugitive stuck close to him. “Pink Beauty’s your little sister? I’m your little brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God Familia members immediately ran off to puke on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off,” Fatty had a serious look on his face. “Fuge, what is the name of the person who paid you a thousand gold coins to help my little sister with her mission? Do you still remember what he looks like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” TheFugitive replied. “XuanYuanSword. I heard that he’s the guild master of a rather famous guild in Vermillion Bird City.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>XuanYuanSword? Qi Xuan? Could they be connected? </span></i><span style>Fatty immediately thought of Qi Xuan, who he had scared and threatened. However, he wasn’t so sure, but if that person was truly Qi Xuan, then Fatty had to take everything more seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“XuanYuanSword, he’s the guild master of Myriad Swords, the ninth ranked guild in Vermillion Bird City. He’s a Level 26 warrior, and is rather chivalrous. He has a pretty high reputation in Vermillion Bird City,” said HeadofGod.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected of a professional, he has information on all four main cities.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Myriad Swords?” Fatty thought about it for a moment. “Fuge, after I clear my red name, come with me to Vermillion Bird City?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By your command!” TheFugitive practically stuck his face onto Fatty’s. “Brother Grub, introduce lil’ bro when we’re there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, we’re going to go with you to Vermillion Bird City too,” HeadofGod chuckled. “We got a mission that needs us to go over there a few days ago. We couldn’t find time for it before, now we’ll just do it as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, allow me to thank you all first,” Fatty was overjoyed. With these twelve rogues, especially when it included an experienced person like HeadofGod, everything would become much simpler.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty chose to take the teleportation portal over to the Beginner’s Village, then spent a dozen minutes or so to kill over a hundred monsters and got rid of his red name. then, he grouped up with everyone else and teleported to Vermillion Bird City together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Vermillion Bird City, haha. I’ve wanted to come and take a look a long time ago,” a thirty something years old player said as he and his group walked out of the portal. This group was Fatty, TheFugitive and the God Familia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The architecture in Vermillion Bird City was of a completely different style to Black Tortoise City's. While the latter’s buildings seemed to reflect the majesty and firmness of the Black Tortoise with simple and straightforward buildings of a dirt yellow color; Avianville’s was constructed entirely of a fiery red material that seemed to radiate liveliness and agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of heat seemed to race forth when the group entered the city, even the bricks underneath their feet seemed to scorch people slightly. When standing at one of the city gates, they could see the statue of a huge soaring fiery Vermillion Bird standing far into the city, and when one looked over, they would feel an aura that makes people want to bow down in submission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What amazing sculpting ability! Whoever made the stature practically reflected all of the Vermillion Bird’s characteristics to the core,” Fatty exclaimed. “Why doesn’t Black Tortoise City have a statue of the Black Tortoise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, this is a virtual reality game, so it’s possible to have this effect with a bit of tech. As for why there isn’t a statue like this in Black Tortoise City, I heard that’s because Black Tortoise City is built directly on the Black Tortoise,” HeadofGod explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Fatty was astonished. </span><i><span style>Even if this is all a game, this is way too much! Black Tortoise City has over a hundred million players, and building a city that can hold so many players directly on the Black Tortoise? Then the Black Tortoise’s size is unimaginable!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shocked? I was really shocked when I heard it for the first time as well,” HeadofGod opened his arms wide as if he was hugging the sky. “The four sacred beasts are the legendary sacred beasts of our country, so it is understandable that they did some unbelievable things for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody else nodded. Indeed, it was normal for the Black Tortoise to be rather huge as one of the guardian sacred beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grub, are you not going to contact lil’ sis?” Qian Xiaoqian had already turned into TheFugitive’s ‘lil’ sis’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I just came to see what kind of person XuanYuanSword is,” Fatty shook his head.</span></p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 2 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
