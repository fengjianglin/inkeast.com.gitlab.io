 <p><span style>Chapter 93 – Trap</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Thundertiger was clearly beyond furious after getting stabbed in its backdoor, making it want to tear its attacker to shreds. It didn’t even attack with its horn and merely lunged forward with its gigantic body with enough force to tear through anything in front of its claws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>TheFugitive and the members of God Familia laid all sorts of trap down. Some of there were damaged based ones; some of them were control based ones; while although some didn’t look like they did anything, they were able to confuse the target, causing the target to attack at blank spots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Fatty was in a team with them, he could naturally see the traps on the ground clearly. He carefully walked around them, while the Horned Thundertiger quickly caught up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first trap triggered almost instantly. Several vines as thick as wrists sprouted up from the ground and coiled around the monster’s limbs, restraining it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Thundertiger shook, breaking the vines, then let out an angry roar. A bolt of lightning shot out from its horn and struck the ground, turning the ripped vines into smithereens. That was the end of the first trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster took another step forward and… activated the second trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a pure damage-based trap a meter long iron spikes glistening with a terrifyingly cold light filled a hole more than two meters deep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thundertiger fell into the hole and the spikes pierced into its body, thrusting a dozen bloody holes into its body. Streams of blood flowed out of its wounds and died the ground red. In Horned Thundertiger lost around ten percent of its health in several seconds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Got ‘im! </span></i><span style>The players thought to themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boss monster let out an angry howl. It crouched down, then leaped, forcefully throwing itself into the air, away from the spikes and out of the traps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get back down there!” the three knights rushed over and pushed against the Horned Thundertiger with their shields in an attempt to push it back into the trap. Yep, the monster merely raised its front paw and smacked a knight into the ground along with his shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the shields of the other two knights struck its body, but merely caused its body to shake a little without falling back into the trap. Instead, the monster shot out two bolts of lightning from its horn, which pierced through the two knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, all the knights ASliverofSmoke had brought with him died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” ASliverofSmoke finally found a chance to attack when he saw the Horned Thundertiger killed his subordinate knights. A spear appeared in his hand, which he then stabbed on the monster’s hind leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, countless arrows and spells rained down on the monster and cut down at its health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somehow, the Horned Thundertiger became even angrier after getting attacked. It smacked its front paw onto the ground, while its horn flared up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up, interrupt it! It’s going to use an ultimate skill!” Qian Xiaoqian shouted and shoot out a fire dragon in an attempt to interrupt the skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, ASliverofSmoke stabbed at the monster with his spear again. Fatty also snuck over in stealth to stab it deep once more, while the ranged attacks rained down their attacks upon the monster once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning on the Horned Thundertiger’s horn seemed to gather thicker and thicker, then, when it reached a certain level, the monster let out a roar, shooting out countless bolts of lightning, which seemed to cause fireworks to bloom in the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>ASliverofSmoke, who was the closest to the monster, was struck by four or five bolts. Meanwhile, several dozen players were also pierced by the attack, leaving less than twenty behind. Even one of the God Familia members died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Qian Xiaoqian was protected by her shield, it defended against several bolts of lightning, while Fatty thought up a great ideal and hit into a trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grubber, here!” HeadofGod called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Fatty crawled out of the trap, he conveniently found himself behind the Horned Thundertoger again. Thus… the poor monster felt a tearing pain at the opening at the end of its rectum once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned ThunderTiger let out an angry roar and shot out bolts of lightning randomly as it chased after Fatty, as if he wasn’t going to rest until tore Fatty apart and gobbled him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run around it!” HeadofGod shouted when he saw Fatty lead the monster over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty felt a bit hesitant when he saw the trap. </span><i><span style>This is a… trap? </span></i><span style>The trap covered over twenty meters and seemed to ooze with cold air. When Fatty god close, he could already feel his movement speed slow down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly walked around the trap. Meanwhile, even though the Horned Thundertiger wasn’t smart, it wasn’t a complete fool. It merely snorted when it noticed Fatty’s clear manner of baiting it, then it followed Fatty’s path around the trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, its injuries on its hind leg and its backside caused it to limp and slow down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Together!” HeadofGod commanded, then vanished in stealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster felt its hind leg get attacked again. Just as it was about to counter-attack, HeadofGod retreated, then disappeared using Invisibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Thundertiger disregarded the pest. It decided not to let a coward bother it and instead wanted to deal with the sleazy fat fly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took a few steps, then got attacked on its hind leg again. This time, TheFugitive was the one who appeared. He laughed provokingly, then disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the monster felt more annoyed as it was attacked on the same place, but was unable to counterattack. However, when it turned back to look at the escaping Fatty, it seemed to decide that it would endure it all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, something else attacked it before it could even take a single step. However, this attack was aimed at a certain dangling object on its lower body instead of its hind leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thundertiger leaped up with a terrible wail of pain. It did not counter-attack and instead looked down. The thing that was supposed to be there was… gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahahaha, a tiger penis! This is good stuff!” BigPillarofGod held a thick purple item that was over a dozen meters long. Then, he chuckled and activated Invisibility before running off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiger Penis? Pillar, this is good stuff, you have to hand it over!” HeadofGod ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, do you have some issues there?” LeftHandofGod laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit. I, your boss, will never falter, never fail. My might is forever! How could I have an issue with that place?” HeadofGod scolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want that thing for? You might as well give it to me,” said RightEyeofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why can’t I take it? I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Thundertiger’s next howl was extremely pitiful. It even wanted to die now that its greatest happiness in life was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop messing around. Push it down,” HeadofGod called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few people suddenly appeared beside the monster and pushed it into the trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, finally,” LefthandofGod chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We done?” Fatty was covered in sweat after the chase. He was nearly out of Vigor as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, it won’t be able to get out,” HeadofGod said confidently. “This trap was something we managed to come up with after a long research. A monster of this level wouldn’t be able to get out easily. It would take at least ten-odd to twenty minutes for that. That’s enough for us to do a lot of stuff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? That’s amazing! No wonder Big Sister Rainbow asked you guys for help when killing the Fire Demon,” Qian Xiaoqian praised when she head that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, no no, it’s just parlor tricks,” HeadofGod said humbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t you just fight any boss monster you want with a trap like this?” Fatty exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not that easy,” HeadofGod explained. “There are a lot of limits to the trap and it also cost a lot. We only prepared two portions of materials in order to kill the Fire Demon. What’s more, it can’t trap overly powerful monsters, while it would just be a waste to trap weaker ones. It really is rather useless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s already amazing to be able to trap a Level 50 yao boss monster. When your levels are high, you will be able to set up an even more amazing trap,” RainbowWatcher walked over after surviving the area of effect attack area. “God Familia truly lives up to the title of the number one assassin familia.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are flattering us,” HeadofGod said humbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us kill the Horned Thundertiger first,” Qian Xiaoqian said excitedly. “I can change my class to the hidden class of Thunder Magus after that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… About that,” HeadofGod suddenly felt rather awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Little Sister Pink, I forgot to tell you something. Although this trap trapped the boss monster, it means that we can only damage the monster through the base damage of the trap. Any external damage will disable the trap, causing the boss to leap out,” TheFugitive walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Qian Xiaoqian, Fatty, RainWatcher and the other players were shocked. No wonder HeadofGod said it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You get it now?” HeadofGod shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Guys, look, what is the boss monster doing?” LeftHandofGod suddenly pointed at the Horned Thundertiger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the Horned Thundertiger was trapped and its health dropped steadily. The removal of the Horned Thundertiger prized body part clearly sent it into a berserk rage. Seeing that it was unable to leave the trap, it howled loudly then became covered in dense black energy. It absorbed some of it, while the rest surged up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, the energy broke through the trap and leaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap, the Horned Thundertiger shattered its inner core and is absorbing its energy!” HeadofGod said frantically. “We can’t deal with it right now, let’s leave. Otherwise, we won’t be able to!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Thundertiger howled towards the sky. When the monster finished it’s the dark energy, it doubled in size, while its horn glistened even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Qian, is there a time limit to the mission?” Fatty suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten hours. I only have one hour left,” Qian Xiaoqian said in a troubled manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Step back,” Fatty took a deep breath and took out an item from his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what are you doing? If I can’t get the class change, then so be it,” Qian Xiaoqian tried to pull Fatty back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll be fine, so don’t worry. Now, stay back,” Fatty gave Qian Xiaoqian an assuring smile, then tossed out the item in his hand.</span></p>
