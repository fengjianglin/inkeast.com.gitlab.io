 <p>Chapter 232 – Righteous Blood Cleanses the Silver Spear<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p> 
 <p>“Mount up!” A player of the God Slayer Alliance abruptly shouted. All of the knights behind him summoned their mounts immediately and got on.</p> 
 <p>Temporarily leaving the Knight’s attack out of the discussion, when mounted, their health and defense would go up by a large chunk, which made it impossible for Rogues to kill them in a short time. If it wasn’t that they had to take the other participant guilds into account as well, the God Slayer Alliance would have comprised a hundred knights to deal with God Familia.</p> 
 <p>The row of ten knights raced towards Fatty in an arc formation. TheFugitive’s group of four simply couldn’t stop them.</p> 
 <p>“Come!” Fatty abandoned the Plenilune Ballista and jumped onto the Earth Dragon. He charged forth to take on the ten knights all by himself.</p> 
 <p>Ka-boom! The mount of the knight at the very front, a Gale Wolf, suddenly stumbled, violently tripping and sending its rider flying.</p> 
 <p>The other players saw very clearly that an ox-sized rat had suddenly shot out from underground and bit off one of the wolf’s front limb.</p> 
 <p>“Think you’re something just because you ride a wolf? Can’t even compare to my rat.” Fatty laughed merrily. Right after that, a ten-meter long, six-meter wide marsh suddenly appeared between the first and the second knight. The second knight’s mount, a tiger, ran right into the marsh and got stuck.</p> 
 <p>Being forcefully halted while at a high speed almost threw off this knight from the tiger’s back. The eight knights behind either hastily pulled their reins or rode around the marsh and kept going for Fatty.</p> 
 <p>However, the marsh acted as a temporary barrier so that Fatty could start a 1v1 with the first knight.</p> 
 <p>“Humph!” Thrown to the ground, the knight got right back up with a flip. Shield in his left hand and sword in his right, he smashed them at each other with a snort. Then, step by step, the knight firmly strode towards Fatty.</p> 
 <p>Rumble! The Earth Dragon violently stomped its front limbs on the ground. At the same time, it let out a thunderous cry. An extremely dense earth-yellow, vast patch of fog was blown at the knight.</p> 
 <p>Boom! The knight evaded the leg-stomping attack with difficulty, only to be welcomed by a yellow cloud that instantly enshrouded him.</p> 
 <p>“How could this be…” Even in death, the knight couldn’t figure out how Fatty, a rogue, could attack while mounted, and how his mount could also attack while being mounted to boot! This was so against the rules in his perception.</p> 
 <p>“Kill!”</p> 
 <p>The rest of the knights approached in a curve and attacked Fatty in unison.</p> 
 <p>Bang! A figure appeared next to Fatty and knocked a knight, plus their mount, five meters away.</p> 
 <p>Crack! Wheat popped out from underground and bit a mount on its leg. At the same time, the rodent violently rammed with its body, as well as threw a dozen stalagmites, which hurled out from the ground.</p> 
 <p>The knights’ formation was broken just like that. Right now, Fatty only needed to face two knights.</p> 
 <p>Bam. A knight suddenly went stiff, being stunned by an Ambush from TheFugitive, who had arrived in Stealth.</p> 
 <p>The other knight’s face abruptly changed in alarm. A retreat was of no use, so he bit the bullet and kept racing at Fatty.</p> 
 <p>At the current stage of the game, the majority of mounts were level 30s normal monsters. The best mounts that some expert-tier players had were but level 40s bosses. None of them was a match for the likes of a Yao monster as the Earth Dragon. Without surprise, this knight was slapped into paste the instant he neared Fatty.</p> 
 <p>“AHHH!” A wretched scream echoed as another knight was pressured to death under Wheat’s butt after being forced off his mount by Wheat and Inky.</p> 
 <p>“Holy Shield!” Just when Fatty steered the Earth Dragon to stomp at a knight, another knight suddenly blocked his path. A huge illusion of a shield was put straight at the spot the Earth Dragon was stomping its foot on.</p> 
 <p>Boom! The huge foot stamped right atop the shield. Creaking noises rang out, but surprisingly, the shield didn’t shatter. Instead, a strong reflecting force pushed the dragon back several steps.</p> 
 <p>“Fatty watch out! He’s a famous expert of White Tiger City, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear. He once killed several hidden class players at once, all by himself,” TheFugitive hurriedly alerted.</p> 
 <p>Fatty’s eyes immediately brightened. “Alright, very good, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear!” Without hesitation, he urged the Earth Dragon to stomp again.</p> 
 <p>BOOM!</p> 
 <p>The Earth Dragon was seven meters tall, fifteen meters long, and more than several thousand kilograms heavy. A stomp of the creature’s foot had the Holy Shield flickering nonstop until it could no longer hold on and emitted creaking noises as cracks started to appear. Finally, the shield crumbled into white spots of light that vanished.</p> 
 <p>By this time, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear and the other knight had retreated to a safe distance.</p> 
 <p>Summoning his mount, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear flung himself on it. The steed was a silvery-white horse. Coupled with its owner’s silver armor, handsome face, and silver spear in hand, there was actually a ‘Zhao Zilong of the Changshan County<span id="fnre2"><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span>’ feel to it. It would have been perfect if his armor was one from ancient China.</p> 
 <p>“1v1?” Seeing the guy pointing his spear at him, Fatty smiled.</p> 
 <p>“4th class enhancement Heavy Cavalry, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear.” The knight on horseback cupped his fist in courtesy.</p> 
 <p>“4th class enhancement Assassin, hidden class Elementalist, Money Grubber.” Fatty cupped his fist in response.</p> 
 <p>“Go!” While the white horse was a far cry from the Earth Dragon, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear wasn’t at all afraid. Half dragging the spear behind him like an ancient general, he spurred the horse towards Fatty.</p> 
 <p>His pet was a silver-feathered Cyan-eyed Eagle, who was tangling with Inky in the sky right now. There was no trace of a second pet.</p> 
 <p>Kaah… Wheat suddenly popped out from underground with a wide-open jaw going for the white horse’s forelimbs.</p> 
 <p>“Haah!” With a loud cry, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear controlled the horse to leap above Wheat.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, the silver spear in his hand moved. The instant they passed above Wheat’s head, three bowl-sized, flower-shaped spear illusions appeared at the spear’s tip. In a triangle formation, they shot towards Wheat.</p> 
 <p>Puff puff puff! The three flowers pierced three bloody holes in Wheat’s body, causing blood to gush out in a stream. Wheat instantly fled underground with a tragic shriek.</p> 
 <p>“An expert in real life.” Fatty squinted his eyes. He urged the Earth Dragon to rush forth and simultaneously poured force in his legs to spring up, stabbing out with his sword.</p> 
 <p>Clang! RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear parried Fatty’s attack with the skill Fiery Prairie. Meanwhile, the white horse dodged the Earth Dragon attack without prompting. From the looks of it, this horse possessed a high intelligence similar to Wheat.</p> 
 <p>Landing gracefully, Fatty instantly entered Stealth. Despite being able to attack while mounted, he was still a rogue. He needed to be on his feet in a serious duel.</p> 
 <p>The grass had been trampled into a mess, so it was impossible to track Fatty with just meticulous observation. RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear held the reins in his left hand and the spear in his right, his eyes half-closed as if resting, waiting in silence for Fatty’s attack.</p> 
 <p>TheFugitive and the other three were still tangling with the knights. Nearby, a team of archers was keeping a vigilant eye, arrows nocked and bowstrings already drawn, waiting for a chance to deal a critical blow to the small group of four rogues.</p> 
 <p>Pfff! All of a sudden, the player fighting TheFugitive suddenly went stiff. A stream of blood gushed out from his throat.</p> 
 <p>Fatty revealed himself with a crafty chuckle, then fled.</p> 
 <p>“Do you not know of chivalry?!!” RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear was furious. He spurred the white horse to chase after Fatty.</p> 
 <p>“The heck? This is China, not the West. What chivalry?!” Fatty turned his head to reply. “Besides, Lord Fatty is a rogue. Everyone can be chivalrous, but Lord Fatty is never one of them.”</p> 
 <p>“RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear, what the hell are you doing?! Holding a one-on-one chivalry fight in the middle of the Guild Group category?! Are you dumb or what?!” Watching everything from afar, God Slayer nearly coughed up mouthfuls of blood in anger several times.</p> 
 <p>“Woah! A word of advice: never be distracted in the middle of a fight.” HeadofGod’s body constantly flashed. His dagger slashed out and nearly beheaded God Slayer.</p> 
 <p>Being teased by Fatty then scolded mercilessly by God Slayer, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear flushed red. Without a word, he galloped towards Fatty.</p> 
 <p>Whoosh. RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear suddenly pulled on the reins. The white horse reared straight back. In front of them, a marsh appeared. Wheat poked out its head a little to glance before disappearing right away.</p> 
 <p>“Money Grubber, don’t go!” RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear brandished his spear as he was hot on Fatty’s heels. Countless flower illusions materialized from the spear jabs and gunned for Fatty’s weak points.</p> 
 <p>Clank clank… Sparks flew as the Elemental Sword parried the spear. Fatty repeatedly retreated several steps, feeling his right hand plus the right half of his body going numb. <em>A knight is indeed much stronger when mounted.</em></p> 
 <p>“Righteous Blood Cleanses the Silver Spear!” RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear suddenly screamed out loud. A bloody light burst forth along the silver spear and expanded. Both enshrouded in a layer of red light, the knight and his horse rushed towards Fatty.</p> 
 <p>Along with his action, the sound of pandemonium broke out from the illusion of a blood river that appeared by his side. Hazy, roaring and screaming figures filled up the river like countless powerful monsters hidden under the blood.</p> 
 <p>“What kind of skill is this?” Pale with fright, Fatty raised the Elemental Sword and took the strike head-on. After executing this skill, whether RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear’s speed or power, both were greatly boosted. Fatty was knocked away a dozen meters and nearly lost hold of his sword.</p> 
 <p>“KILL!” RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear let out another scream and charged at Fatty with an unmatchable momentum.</p> 
 <p>“His spear is a damaged Divine weapon, the Sky Ripper Spear,” TheFugitive’s voice rang out.</p> 
 <p>“F*ck!” Fatty only had enough time to spit out one word when RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear’s flower illusions enshrouded him. He had to resort to Earthwalk.</p> 
 <p>Sizzle… Countless flower illusions rained on the ground. At the spot that Fatty had just vanished from, the tattered grass fluttered disorderly. The ground was thoroughly weeded in the blink of an eye when the soil was blown up.</p> 
 <p>“When fighting the enemy, capture their king first. When shooting a person, shoot his horse first.” Fatty Earthwalked to below the white horse and stabbed his sword at the steed.</p> 
 <p>Clink! On horseback, RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear suddenly bent over and pushed away Fatty’s strike with a flick of his spear.</p> 
 <p>“Well done!” Fatty shouted. His face revealed a trace of excitement and his hand itched for action.</p> 
 <p>Whoosh whoosh… Several arrows seized the chance to fly over. The archer team at a distance planned to take advantage of the situation to kill off Fatty.</p> 
 <p>“This is still a competition. When it’s over, let’s have a proper duel to our heart’s content.” Fatty laughed heartily before he suddenly vanished.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t go, finish our fight first!” RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear yelped.</p> 
 <p>Ignoring RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear, Fatty and TheFugitive cooperated to assassinate a player. The target couldn’t even put up a protest being completely overwhelmed by the duo. The duo’s biggest threat was the archer team in the distance. Their mass arrow attack nearly killed them several times.</p> 
 <p>“Let the knights be for now. Handle the archers first,” Fatty said via party chat.</p> 
 <p>Rumble… The Earth Dragon charged screaming toward the archers. At the same time, Wheat also abandoned RighteousBloodCleansestheSilverSpear and popped out from underground to thwart the archers’ attack with Howling Bullets.</p>
