 <p><span style>Chapter 73 – Vermillion Bird City</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grubber, we’re going to do our mission now. See you later,”said HeadofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What mission do you have here?” Fatty couldn’t help but to ask after waving .</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Assassination,” HeadofGod said very in a cool manner, then lead the rest of God Familia away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you not going with them?” Fatty glanced at TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Barbaric things such as killing someone is not something that an elegant person such as I, TheFugitive, should do,” TheFugitive said proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, did you hear that? That sleazy looking guy actually called himself elegant,” two female players whispered on the side as they snuck peeks at Fatty and TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, they’re clearly bad people. One of them’s lecherous, the other one’s sleazy,” the other female player clucked her tongue and seemed to have a clear problem with how the Fatty and TheFugitive looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuge, they said that you’re lecherous and sleazy,” Fatty immediately turned to TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of Vermillion Bird City’s chicks, they really have good taste to be able to identify such a great man like myself at first glance,” TheFugitive didn’t care that Fatty was misquoting and merely winked towards the two female players.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ewww,” the clicked their tongues, they ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha,” TheFugitive laughed. “Brother Grub, you see that? That’s defeating your enemy without combat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop being such a weirdo,” Fatty looked towards the gate of Vermillion Bird City. “Let’s walk around for a bit first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Are we not going to find Lil’ Sis?” TheFugitive immediately asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuge, I’m warning you. You can call her Pink, Beauty or even Pink Beauty, but you are not permitted to call her Lil’ Sis,” Fatty growled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, alright. Are we not going to find Little Sister Pink?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty calmed himself down for a moment, then decided not to argue with this person who clearly had no shame. “I only came here to see just what kind of person that XuanYuanSword is. I don’t want my little sister to know I’m looking into him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then can’t we just ask around?” TheFugitive immediately lost all interest when heard that they weren’t going to find Qian Xiaoqian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pair begun to ask around Vermillion Bird City. It was clear that Myriad Swords was very well known as the ninth ranking guild in the city. They asked a few people and most of them knew exactly who and what they were talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“XuanYuanSword, the guild master of Myriad Swords is handsome and tall with a heroic aura around him. He is around his mid-twenties and is very trustworthy and loyal. He also acts rather chivalrously, so many people have a good impression of him. Even the guild masters of the competing guilds have endless praises for him,” TheFugitive summarized the information they heard and turned to Fatty. “He sounds pretty nice. Man, a future brother-in-law like him really makes me feel pressured when he’s almost as cool as me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty waved his hand. He was in no mood to argue with TheFugitive. Although in-game appearance can differ from real life, he was pretty sure that XuanYuanSword wasn’t Qi Xuan. According to what Fatty knew about him, Qi Xuan definitely wouldn’t be able to do all this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move, move!” a few players pushed Fatty and TheFugitive aside and raced towards the outside of the city gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dude, you insane? The path is so wide, why the heck did you have to walk right I am?” TheFugitive cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, who ya’ talking about?” the people heard TheFugitive’s words and turned around, while Humpdapanda, a warrior with a carrying a sword on his back, asked menacingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was cursing my grandson, how’s that any of your business?” TheFugitive said lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are f*cking seeking death. Come outside of the city if you dare!” another person, MidnightPeeker, pointed at TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh, don’t go outside. Those people aren’t easy to deal with. Everything will be fine as long as you endure it for a moment,” a player beside TheFugitive whispered to him and Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks for your advice. May I ask who are these people? How dare they be so cocky?” Fatty asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know? I guess you aren’t Vermillion Bird City players. No wonder you dared to get into a conflict with them. They’re all from Myriad Swords, the ninth ranking guild in the city. Their guild has experts such as the Heavenly Mountain’s Seven Swords, and the Nine Divine Martial Swords. Their guild master, XuanYuanSword, is also the third on the leaderboards!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought XuanYuanSword is supposed to be trustworthy, loyal and chivalrous? Why does he have some people like them working for him?” TheFugitive asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, it’s impossible to make every single one of his subordinates a gentleman. Every single guild has a few scum players,” the player shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You don’t dare? Then keep turtling inside the city. Haha, I think you guys should go to Black Tortoise City. That’s where you belong,” the Myriad Sword players laughed, causing a bunch of players to stand on the side and watch the show unfold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much,” Fatty thanked the player who answered their questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the two didn’t heed his advice, the player didn’t say anything more. He already did his part, if the pair didn’t listen to him and got into trouble, then it was all on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Tortoise City?” Fatty chuckled. “Ooh, now I remember. I saw you in Black Tortoise City before. You told me that Black Tortoise City’s really nice and going over there was like going back home. Hiding in Black Tortoise City was damn safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people all began laughing, causing the face of the player who spoke initially to turn red in anger and embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boy, stop playing with words. Come outside the city and let’s see how strong you are,” the players immediately want to get even when they noticed that they their insults weren’t working.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, fighting again? That’s boring,” Fatty sighed. “But whatever, lead the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty and TheFugitive followed the players out of town with a group of players who wanted to watch the show unfold following behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, onlooking, a true Chinese problem,” Fatty sighed. When he saw that they already left the city, he shouted out. “Alright, if you want to fight, then hurry up. We still have stuff to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty had no good will towards Myriad Swords, so he naturally did not treat these people nicely either. The only reason he agreed to the fight was because he wanted to see just how strong Myriad Sword’s players were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, brat. You still have time to beg for mercy,” Humpdapanda walked over and drew the sword behind his back with a menacing smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why does he bullshit so much?” Fatty muttered quietly. “Hey, Fuge, you first or me first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, little brother is here, how could I make Brother Grub make the first move?” TheFugitive chuckled, then stopped forward, before turning back with a whisper. “Brother Grub, if we see Little Sister Pink later, then introduce us properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this!” Humpdapanda did not hold back when he saw TheFugitive step forth. He grasped his sword with both hands and hacked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a sec,” TheFugitive quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Humpdapanda stopped after his attack had missed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How big’s your thing?” TheFugitive questioned. When he saw Humpdapanda’s look of confusion, he quickly explained what he meant. “You humped a panda, so you naturally had a reason to do so. If you could do it normally, why would you hump a panda?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking for it!” Humpdapanda was outraged and charged up with his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha,” TheFugitive laughed, then disappeared on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Night Blade Flurry!” Humpdapanda called out and thrust his sword ten-odd times in his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The slashes disappeared, but TheFugitive’s flustered figure didn’t appear like Humpdapanda had expected. The area was merely silent, while the onlooking hunters were holding their breaths and waiting for the start of a good show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humpdapanda did not lose his nerve when he failed to locate TheFugitive. He walked a few steps around and hacked randomly around him, but still did not find TheFugitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Come out here, get your ass out here! Do players from Black Tortoise City only know how to dodge? If you’re so amazing, then come out,” Humpdapanda gradually become more anxious as time passed. He already used Night Blade Flurry, a skill with 120 seconds cooldown, thrice, but he still failed to even get a glimpse of where TheFugitive was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You pussy, are you a man or not? If you are a man, then fight me!” Humpdapanda felt more and more worried as he swung his sword. “What? Do you not dare to attack me? I knew it. Myriad Swords is not someone a puny small fry like you can offend. If you aren’t going to come out, then I’m leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humpdapanda wanted to walk off, but at that very moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, what a pitiful person. I’ve just been standing here without moving,” TheFugitive’s voice sounded out as he revealed himself. Like he said, he stood exactly where he was a while ago. Humpdapanda merely made a complete fool of himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Humpdapanda nearly coughed up a mouthful of blood. After so long, he was actually just seen as a clown and nothing more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When TheFugitive saw Humpdapanda’s expression, he suddenly thought of his first encounter with Fatty. Back then, he wanted to fight Fatty one on one in the fourth floor of Mass Graves, but he waited for a long time and even changed location several times, only to find out that Fatty already went to the fifth floor, not only wasting a lot of his time, but also making him embarrass himself completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>TheFugitive glared at Fatty, then felt like he really should give this person, who now shares his pain, a swift end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty was speechless. </span><i><span style>You’re fighting, why are you glaring at me? Is it just because I managed to chat up a little beauty?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A female player exclaimed beside Fatty, “Wow, your friend is so amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>TheFugitive couldn’t even be bothered to go into stealth. He used Acceleration and charged forth, feinting an attack to waste one of Humpdapanda’s skills, then allowed the latter to attack him first to prevent getting a red name after killing the latter. Before Humpdapanda could use his sword to defend, he felt a dagger slice across his throat. Then, he died after TheFugitive used combo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, he’s my lackey,” Fatty nodded indifferently. “Does your Rainrevelers guild only consist of female players? That’s just like the Ice Rose Alliance back in our city. Who’s your guild master? RainbowWatcher[1. The original name in Chinese is </span><span style>凭栏听雨</span><span style>, which translates literally to leaning on the fence and watching the rain. However, the deeper meaning behind this sentence is to not just watch the rain, but realize that a clear sky will return after the rain has passed. I chose to use RainbowWatcher, because seeing a rainbow after a storm has a similar sort of feeling to the meaning conveyed by the Chinese name used.]? She’s the third beauty in Vermillion Bird City? I definitely have to meet her in the future. What? Your vice guild master is Pink Beauty, the number one beauty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re TheFugitive?” Humpdapanda found out about TheFugitive’s name as he was killed, causing his companions to exclaim. It was clear that TheFugitive did have quite a reputation in Vermillion Bird City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You know our vice guild master?” At that moment, the female player was completely drawn to Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guild Master, TheFugitive killed one of our brothers outside the city gate,” on the other side of Vermillion Bird City, a player reported to another player carrying a strange long sword on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, TheFugitive thinks that he can offend us just because he’s number nineteen on the assassin rankings? Tell DragonSword to kill him,” the listener said plainly.</span></p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 2 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
