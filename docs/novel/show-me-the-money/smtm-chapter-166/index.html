 <p>Chapter 166 – LittleLi’s FlyingDagger<span id="fnre1"><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p> 
 <p>“This Money Grubber is very confident,” the Golden Scale guild master chuckled softly upon hearing about Fatty’s response.</p> 
 <p>“Young Master, we have investigated his address in real life. Should we send some people there?” ISteal&amp;IRob made a “threaten” gesture.</p> 
 <p>“No need,” the Golden Scale guild master squinted his eyes. “It is just a mere skill book. If we drag this to the real world, we will definitely be laughed at. Tell him that I want to make a bet with him. If he wins the bet, he’ll get the book.”</p> 
 <p>“Bet? What kind of bet?” Fatty asked dubiously upon receiving ISteal&amp;IRob’s message.</p> 
 <p>“A one-on-one fight,” ISteal&amp;IRob said under his breath. “We heard that you killed Cloud Dragon Sailing multiple times and your PK skill is impressive. Our Young Master is very interested. If you defeat the person we send out, you’ll get the Metalwalk book. If you lose, you give us the Waterwalk book and join our guild.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright,” Fatty agreed with no problem.</p> 
 <p>Fatty arrived outside of Azure Dragon City riding Wheat, causing a crowd to flock over to observe him. Fatty had become famous as the reward announced by the Cloud Dragon Gang had spread through the other three main cities. Even though Cloud Dragon Sailing sold the Metalwalk book to the Golden Scale guild master, he didn’t take off the “wanted” announcement.</p> 
 <p>If it weren’t for the deterrent of the Golden Scale Guild members around, these people would have pounced to beat up Fatty.</p> 
 <p>“I am Golden Scale TheMighty. Brother Grubber, long time no see,” the guild master of the Golden Scale Guild greeted Fatty with a nod.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you sending?” Fatty cut to the chase.</p> 
 <p>“Please wait a moment,” as he replied, a player emerged from the Teleportation Portal.</p> 
 <p>Fatty made a strange facial expression upon seeing the approaching player. This person’s body was weak, a little sickly even. He seemed to wobble with each step as if a strong breeze could blow him away. From this player’s equipment, he was evidently a rogue as well.</p> 
 <p>However, this person’s face was full of arrogance, which made him very irritating to look at.</p> 
 <p>“Let me introduce, this gentleman is the first ranked expert on the rogue ranking, LittleLi’s FlyingDagger,” Golden Scale TheMighty’s hand gestured toward the player.</p> 
 <p>“LittleLi’s FlyingDagger?” The crowd stirred. LittleLi’s FlyingDagger was famous not only for his ranking but more importantly, for hunting down and killing a Yao boss when he was less than level 30.</p> 
 <p>In an open area without any favorable conditions, this guy relied solely on his equipment and skill to forcefully slay a Yao boss.</p> 
 <p>“Big Brother Fatty, let’s not take this bet. We can think of another way,” next to Fatty, Purple Bell hurriedly sent him a message.</p> 
 <p>Giving Purple Bell a reassuring smile, Fatty ignored LittleLi’s FlyingDagger and said to Golden Scale TheMighty, “Where do we duel? What are the rules?”</p> 
 <p>“There are no rules,” Golden Scale TheMighty smiled. “As for the stage, anywhere will do. The only out of bounds area is the city.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, let’s start then,” Fatty nodded.</p> 
 <p>“How about you, brother Li?” Golden Scale TheMighty asked.</p> 
 <p>“Since I agreed to help you, I’ll naturally carry out my promise. If I lose, though, you can’t blame me,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger seemed troubled as he glanced at Fatty.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe, it seems Brother Grubber is a hidden expert, even Brother Li isn’t confident about winning,” Golden Scale TheMightly laughed loudly. “Don’t take it too seriously, consider this making friend through a fight.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing these words, both Fatty and LittleLi’s FlyingDagger smiled.</p> 
 <p><em>Since you’ve said it like that, we definitely won’t worry about winning and losing.</em> LittleLi’s FlyingDagger remarked in his heart. Catching the signaling glance that Fatty sent him, he helplessly used Stealth and disappeared.</p> 
 <p>“Alright everyone, let’s ready ourselves for a fierce duel from the experts,” Golden Scale TheMighty smiled from the seat of his mount.</p> 
 <p>In a forest a distance away from where they previously were, Fatty and LittleLi’s FlyingDagger appeared one after the other.</p> 
 <p>“Not bad, not bad. Tsk. First in the rogue ranking, very impressive,” Fatty halted and turned to LittleLi’s FlyingDagger behind him.</p> 
 <p>“Heheh, all thanks to master’s teaching,” at this moment, LittleLi’s FlyingDagger didn’t have one bit of arrogance left on his face. He stepped forward and gave Fatty a shoulder massage with a fawning smile.</p> 
 <p>“How are you acquainted with the Golden Scale Guild?” Enjoying LittleLi’s FlyingDagger’s ministrations, Fatty squinted his eyes pleasingly.</p> 
 <p>“The guild master helped me out once in real life, so I agreed to help him do three things. This one is the third,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger recapped.</p> 
 <p>“So that’s how,” Fatty nodded. “I heard you slew a Yao boss all by yourself?”</p> 
 <p>“Hehe, it’s luck, it’s just luck,” despite saying so, his glowing face clearly showed that he was bragging.</p> 
 <p>“Luck your butt!” Fatty slapped LittleLi’s FlyingDagger on his head. “This is not how you act modestly.”</p> 
 <p>“Heheh,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger laughed dumbly.</p> 
 <p>After a brief silence, Fatty asked, “How have you been lately?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m okay,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger thought for a second. “After you left, I also moved to another place. I had passed my days quite well with the money I had saved up from earlier. Then the game came out, so I bought a helmet. I never thought I’d see you in here, master.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s all good, then,” Fatty sighed. “I had left too hastily and didn’t have time to make arrangements for you, so I was a little worried. Then I remembered that you are no less experienced than me and can live very well by yourself anyway, so I didn’t go look for you.”</p> 
 <p>“Heheh, thanks for thinking of me, master. On the off chance, Master, do you have any celestial or legendary items that you don’t use? Your disciple could use some,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger laughed fawningly.</p> 
 <p>“Damn you! If I have those things, I could have just destroyed the entire Golden Scale Guild and saved myself from all of this trouble!” Fatty raised his hand, acting as if he wanted to hit.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t hit me; I’ll become dumb if you do!” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger hastily hugged his head.</p> 
 <p>Fatty snorted and put down his hand.</p> 
 <p>“Master, what is that skill book thingy? Everyone is making a fuss over it lately,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger asked.</p> 
 <p>Fatty directly took out the Quad-Elemental Movement book and tossed it to LittleLi’s Flying Dagger. The latter only took a glance at it before he dropped to the ground with the book in his embrace and lay there motionlessly.</p> 
 <p>“Uwuu, master, how are you so lucky? A class unique to Chinese culture, ahhhh, anyone can tell how formidable it’s gonna be!”</p> 
 <p>“Get up! Don’t make my book dirty,” Fatty kicked LittleLi’s FlyingDagger to the side and picked up the skill book.</p> 
 <p>“Master, how about we kill Golden Scale TheMighty? It is probable that we can make him drop that skill book,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger rolled over and scrambled to his feet, speaking excitedly.</p> 
 <p>“What the heck are you so excited for? Do you still want to place this game peacefully?” Fatty retorted. <em>Agreeing to help him then allying with the opponent to kill the guy? Golden Scale TheMighty would go berserk!</em></p> 
 <p>“Ahhh, poor little me. I’ve never died once ever since playing this game. I can’t believe I’ll have to give my first time to master. Uwuu, master, please be gentle okay?” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger closed his eyes in a brave and tragic manner.</p> 
 <p>Giving LittleLi’s FlyingDagger a violent kick to the butt, Fatty didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry.</p> 
 <p>“Golden Scale TheMighty didn’t require you to take a video of the duel?” Fatty suddenly thought of it.</p> 
 <p>“He didn’t, but if we don’t take out some proof, he wouldn’t be tricked so easily,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger tilted his head and pondered.</p> 
 <p>“How about we go for a real fight?” Fatty looked evilly at LittleLi’s FlyingDagger.</p> 
 <p>“If you promise to not get back at me after if you lose, then I’m happy to oblige,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger jumped up.</p> 
 <p>“What? Wanna take advantage of me?” Fatty shot him a glance. “Let Lord Fatty see your stats.”</p> 
 <p>Whoosh. LittleLi’s FlyingDagger immediately displayed his stats and looked smugly at Fatty.</p> 
 <p>Name: LittleLi’s FlyingDagger <br> Class: Underworld Assassin <br> Secondary Profession: Apothecary <br> Level: 35</p> 
 <p>“F*ck! Another goddamn hidden class,” Fatty was angry and extremely upset. <em>These things come out like there’s no end, but why is it so hard when I want to get one?</em></p> 
 <p>Looking at the annoyingly smug face of LittleLi’s FlyingDagger, Fatty was genuinely furious. <em>Wait until Lord Fatty gets my hidden class enhancement and then a full violet set. I’ll beat you all up until you’re toothless!</em></p> 
 <p>“Alright, let’s not waste time and get it out of the way,” Fatty drew his dagger and looked darkly at LittleLi’s FlyingDagger.</p> 
 <p>“I truly have to lose a level?” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger’s expression froze as he immediately withered.</p> 
 <p>“There’s no other way. Lord Fatty has to admit; I can’t defeat you right now.” After taking a look at LittleLi’s FlyingDagger’s imposing equipment, Fatty could only escape safely. If they were to fight to the death seriously, Fatty knew he didn’t have much chance of winning.</p> 
 <p>Moreover, the Golden Scale Guild wanted a fight until one player died, so Fatty wished to save the trouble by simply sending LittleLi’s FlyingDagger on a free trip back.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, this is for you, consider it compensation,” Fatty thought for a bit and took out an item. It was indeed the map with the hidden location of a Celestial item.</p> 
 <p>“A hidden Celestial item? You’re not tricking me, right?” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger was expressing complete distrust toward Fatty.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with the nonsense?” Fatty brandished his dagger.</p> 
 <p>“One last thing, is Lil’ Sis Qian playing this game? What’s her ID?” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger hurriedly shouted.</p> 
 <p>“Vermilion Bird City. Go look for her yourself,” Fatty neatly stabbed down.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“Why is there no movement yet?”</p> 
 <p>Waiting for half a day without any commotion, Golden Scale TheMighty began to grow incredulous.</p> 
 <p>“Are those two still fighting? It shouldn’t take this long,” ISteal&amp;IRob was also dubious as he exchanged glances with Golden Scale TheMighty.</p> 
 <p>“Ohhh,” right at this moment, a player near the Teleportation Portal clamored, “LittleLi’s FlyingDagger is dead and has respawned, LittleLi’s FlyingDagger is dead and respawned!”</p> 
 <p>“What?” Golden Scale TheMighty’s eyes were showing complete disbelief.</p> 
 <p>“I’m very sorry,” LittleLi’s FlyingDagger walked to Golden Scale TheMighty, looking very ashamed.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it. It seems I underestimated him,” Golden Scale TheMighty exclaimed with a long sigh. Seeing Fatty coming over, he reluctantly took out the Metalwalk skill book.</p> 
 <p>“Many thanks, Golden Scale guild master,” Fatty said sincerely as he received the book.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Grubber, do you truly have no intention to join a guild?” Golden Scale TheMighty still tried asking in the end.</p> 
 <p>“Hehe, I’m used to being alone. I don’t like being tied down,” Fatty chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“Then I wish Brother Grubber luck in gaining the five skill books and getting your hidden class enhancement. Alright, let’s leave.”</p> 
 <p>As the members of the Golden Scale Guild left, LittleLi’s FlyingDagger blinked his eyes at Fatty and departed as well. Looking at the players around who were restless with ill intentions, Fatty snorted coldly, then tore a Recall Scroll without hesitation.</p>
