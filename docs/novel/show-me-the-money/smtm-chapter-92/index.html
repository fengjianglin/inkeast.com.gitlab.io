 <p><span style>Chapter 92 – Horned Thundertiger</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the players glared angrily at TheFugitive when they heard his voice. Fatty also sent him falling down onto the ground with a flying kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Money Grubber, you dare to steal this one as well!?” ASliverofSmoke had a dark look on his face. Just as he was about to send his people to stop Fatty, Qian Xiaoqian exclaimed in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro?” ASliverofSmoke’s face was frozen with a dark look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoqian take cover!” Fatty shouted, then flung himself at the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster roared as a bolt of lightning surged out from its horn. At the same time, it swung its baton-like tail towards Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty crashed into the tail, he felt the force pushed through him, causing him to fly back. At the same time, he took a glance at Qian Xiaoqian and noticed a sparking shield of lightning in front of her. It was only around an inch in length and width and had some simple patterns on it. Yet, the horned tiger’s attack was actually unable to pierce through!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, careful. This is a Horned Thundertiger, a Level 50 low ranked yao,” Qian Xiaoqian said urgently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Low ranked yao?” Fatty shuddered, then hurried stepped back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grub, you’re terrible. We’re all friends and since she’s your little sister, she’s our little sister as well. How could we let you charge in alone? Little Sister Pink, remember Big Brother Fuge?” TheFugitve said shamelessly as he climbed off the ground, while the God Familia members hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you alright?” Qian Xiaoqian disregarded the comment and ran over to Fatty caringly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, don’t worry about it. I’ll be fine even if I die,” Fatty laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say that,” Qian Xiaoqian pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty could only chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, this is your brother?” RainbowWatcher asked in confusion behind Qian Xiaoqian. </span><i><span style>Didn’t they say that he is just TheFugitive’s lackey? How did he turn into Pink Beauty’s brother?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, my real older brother,” Qian Xiaoqian wrapped her arms around Fatty’s proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So Brother Grubber is the brother of Vice Guild Master Beauty. Haha, it was just a misunderstanding earlier, please don’t take it to heart,” ASliverofSmoke walked up after a brief pause.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Misunderstanding? No? I took your drops, so it makes sense that you chased after me,” Fatty never acted nicely towards anyone with an interest in Qian Xiaoqian, possibly due to a reluctance to part with her. That was why Fatty treated anyone with that line of thought as a bad guy who was going to steal his little sister away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, bro, you took Guild Master Smoke’s drops?” Qian Xiaoqian exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>RainbowWatcher’s eyes also shone with a shocked light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just who was ASliverofSmoke? Even though he wasn’t on the leaderboards, he was ranked ninth on the hero rankings and was the guild master of Sword Manor, the third ranking guild in Vermillion Bird City. Unless if it was for personal matters, he would always bring several hundred guards with him whenever he goes out. </span><i><span style>Someone like that had his drops snatched up by the big brother? </span></i><span style>Qian Xiaoqian was shocked. It wasn’t because her brother dared to take from ASliverofSmoke, it was because he actually </span><i><span style>did</span></i><span style> it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they can refer to a similar situation, the meaning behind the two was far too different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grubber is funny. Those were drops that XuanYuanSword hired DreamButterfly and SnowPhoenix to get. What’s more, there were several other guild masters present, no matter what happens, it wouldn’t have ended up with Sword Manor,” ASliverofSmoke smiled and went over the topic.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Other guilds were there too? </span></i><span style>Qian Xiaoqian was even more surprised, and RainbowWatcher’s eyes sparkled as she checked out Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horn Thundertiger roared, as if trying to remind the players of its presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now, let us catch up later. We should kill the Horned Thundertiger first. This is a mission monster that Little Sister Beauty needs to kill to change class to the hidden Thunder Magus class,” RainbowWatcher glanced at Fatty as if she was reprimanding him for not revealing his relationship with Qian Xiaoquan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hidden Thunder Magus class?” Fatty immediately turned to HeadofGod. “Brother Head, please lend me a hand this time and name your price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Grubber, we’re all friends here, so let’s not talk about that,” HeadofGod chuckled, then turned to the Horned Thundertiger with a frown. “If it’s a Level 50 gold boss, then I am confident that we can kill it with a few deaths, but since it is a low ranked yao, that makes it a stronger monster than a gold boss monster, so we have to plan accordingly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Horned Thundertiger, it is a Level 50 low ranked yao. For physical skills, it possesses the skills Lunge and Tear, while it uses the horn on its head for magical attacks. If it charges it up for a while, then the lightning would be able to one-shot a full Endurance Knight. It has extremely fast movement speed and attacks, making it a monster with high attack, defense, health and speed,” Qian Xiaoqian quickly described the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see,” Fatty rubbed his chin. “Hey, Brother Head, how did you guys kill the Fire Demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How else? Just traps plus assassination,” HeadofGod replied. “The Fire Demon was huge and clumsy, so traps are rather useful, but this monster is fast and agile. Traps might not work so well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, let’s try it first and hope this Horned Thundertiger doesn’t have a particularly smart AI,” said Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, most monsters except special monsters don’t have a really smart AI,” said HeadofGod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the players finished their discussion, the Horned Thundertiger couldn’t stand it anymore and began its assault. It roared, then shot out a bolt of lightning. Then, he leaped up four to five meters into the air and spread its limbs. Its front paws seemed to glisten with a cold light, while it opened its jaws and lunged at Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does it think that I’m tastier because I have more meat on me? </span></i><span style>Fatty was speechless. </span><i><span style>Why does this monster like targeting me so much?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly retreated, causing the Horned Thundertiger to fall on the ground. It let out a howl, causing a gust of wind to blow past and damage Fatty for more than twenty percent of his health.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s so strong! </span></i><span style>Fatty gasped. But he took the chance of the monster howling to thrust his dagger forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Coil!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A silver python coiled around the monster, but dispersed very quickly. </span><i><span style>Like I thought, the chances of success is too small and it doesn’t work on higher leveled monsters.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Knights, start tanking!” ASliverofSmoke ordered. Now that God Familia went off to set traps up, someone must draw the aggro of the monster and buy the assassins time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd knights, who each held a shield around half their height, split into two rolls and advanced towards the Horned Thundertiger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster growled, then shout out a bolt of lightning from its horn, which pierced through a shield and hit the chest of the knight behind it. The knight died instantly. Seeing that, although the other knights did not retreat, they were still clearly faltered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fear not, keep tanking! Every one of you who ends up dying will be compensated a thousand gold coins!” ASliverofSmoke shouted. Rewards always brought out some brave people. When a thousand gold coins was equal to around a hundred thousand RMB, something that a person wouldn’t be able to earn in a year, dying once suddenly seemed like nothing special. After all, they would get respawned immediately. It was also obvious that ASliverofSmoke was dumping a lot of money just to please Qian Xiaoqian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, all of the knights became a lot more energetic as they charged over with their shields up. The Horned Thundertiger was clearly stunned, as it got knocked by back the shields.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster was outraged. Its horn flared up and killed three knights in less than thirty seconds. However, due to ASliverofSmoke’s promise, the other knights did not fear death, they continued to push against the Horned Thundertiger with their shields.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The traps ready, lure it over!” HeadofGod suddenly shouted. The twelve people set up a series of traps in one area. It was all down to see whether the traps would be able to trap the Horned Thundertiger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go,” more and more knights died very quickly. Soon, only three remained. When they heard Fatty’s words, they immediately made way. Fatty lunged over and stabbed the tiger under its chin before shooting back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-25</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh, only two digits. I wouldn’t even be able to kill it even if it doesn’t move and just let me attack it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody was happy about being stabbed in the chin and that was especially a case for a high leveled bsos monster like the Horned Thundertiger. It immediately turned ran towards Fatty and shot out a lightning from its horn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, careful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bolt of lightning shot near Fatty in an instant. Yet, at the brink of the moment, he lost his balance, causing him to fall sideways, which made the bolt of lightning on graze his left shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This boss monster has such a fast attack frequency!” HeadofGod exclaimed. When one counted carefully, the monster actually had an interval of less than three seconds between each shot from its horns!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should continue to set up traps and leave the rest to them,” HeadofGod commented when he judged the traps to be unable to restrict the Horned Thundertiger’s movements for long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty quickly drank a red potion with a stark white face. He was even able to hold on for several rounds against the advance boss, the Phantom Messenger, but this Horned Thundertiger nearly insta-killed him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I’ll lure it over. I’m not afraid of its lightning attack,” Qian Xiaoqian shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’ll do it. Everybody, move! I’ll lure it alone,” Fatty roared, then leaped forward again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Thundertiger howled towards the sky in anger as its horn sparkled sizzled with electricity. At the same time, it also swung its tail against Fatty’s dagger, then shot out a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Invisibility!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty was already prepared before he attacked. He leaned sideways, then disappeared after his dagger was struck. The lightning merely passed through where he was and struck a patch of empty ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty appeared as quickly as he vanished. This time, his dagger lodged itself at the monster’s back side and into a certain hole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Horned Thundertiger leaped up with a yelp, then its tiger spun around like a windmill, which brought up a gust of raging wind. When it finally fell back down onto the ground, it looked at Fatty with bloodshot eyes, then let out a growl before lunging forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There we go. </span></i><span style>Fatty thought to himself.</span></p>
