 <p><span style>Chapter 88 – I’m a Monster with a Dream!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lava pool bubbled with heat, while the lava swirled around. If anyone fell in, then they would die without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty thought about it for a long time as he looked at the strange lotus leaves and flower in the pool, then finally decided to risk it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tossed a boulder the size of a table into the pool. Soon after, it sank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Fatty tossed another boulder in, but it also sank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the lack of heat damage, Fatty wasn’t worried at all and slowly tossed boulders at the same spot over and over again. Then finally, after thirty something boulders, the boulder no longer sank and remained above the lava.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got ‘em!” Fatty snapped his fingers, found more boulders, then begun tossing at a further distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is he still not coming out?” DreamButterfly asked in confusion outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He must have died,” Merry Men’s guild master said casually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we go in and take a look?” SnowPhoenix suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s wait a bit. Flame Ruler is too powerful of a monster, we’ll definitely die if we bump into it,” replied ASliverofSmoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Fatty threw all the rocks and boulders he could pick up into the lava pool, it finally managed to create several footholds. He really was lucky that the lava pool wasn’t very deep even though it was very large.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The closest place on the shore near the fiery lotus was just slightly more than ten meters. Fatty was able to create six footholds in this area with a bit more than one meter in between each one on average. It was definitely enough for him to reach the lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty carefully put his foot on the first foothold and tapped it. Although it was a bit wobbly, Fatty was able to keep it stable. Then, he put his other foot on it as well. When he saw that the boulder didn’t slide into the lava, he let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his foot once again, then placed it on the second foothold. Like the previous one, although it was a bit wobbly, he was able to maintain his balance, so he put his second foot on there as well, then begun to make his way towards the third foothold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, haha!” When Fatty reached the third foothold, a series of laughter sounded out in the air.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crap, there’s no doubt. That voice is the Flame Ruler!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was in near the strange lotus, Fatty still felt a wave of heat surge forth, which caused him to nearly lose his balance and fall into the pool of lava.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, little fatty, you better stand still, otherwise, I’ll be in for some roast pork,” a figure over two meters shouted loudly in front of Fatty. The figure was donned in a red armor, and had long red hair and an unclear expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty tried his hardest to maintain his balance, then asked the figure calmly, “Flame Ruler?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bingo, that’s right!” Flame Ruler snapped his fingers, causing a ball of fire to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty smiled wryly. </span><i><span style>I didn’t see any monsters here, so I didn’t expect the Flame Ruler to come out now. If he came out only slightly later, then I would have gotten it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fatty, so you like my treasure a lot,” said Flame Ruler.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very much,” Fatty nodded honestly. </span><i><span style>Since I’m going to die anyways, maybe I should see if I can get anything good before I die.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I won’t give it to you even though you like it,” Flame Ruler said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty wanted to kick Flame Ruler in the face. </span><i><span style>No? Then why the heck are you wasting your breath for?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Fatty, you’re really daring, you actually dare to come here and steal from me even though you’re so low level. But you are also very lucky, I’ve seen quite a few people like you cause trouble in my turf these few days, but they were all killed by my subordinates before they got here,” Flame Ruler continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, your subordinates are truly amazing,” Fatty flattered the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, they are my subordinates. The subordinates of Flame Ruler are experts amongst experts, the greatest among the greatest, and tough guys that do it ten times per day!” Flame Ruler said proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem,” Fatty nearly choked on his saliva. </span><i><span style>Seriously, this Flame Ruler’s AI is damn advanced! But why are the stuff it’s saying so… strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Ahh, what a pitiful fatty. You actually got phthisis<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> at such a young age. I feel so bad for you,” Flame Ruler sighed.</span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck this. </span></i><span style>Fatty cursed. He understood, the Flame Ruler was just messing with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O great Flame Ruler, why are these lotus leaves and the lotus flower so strange? They are of completely opposite attributes, but why can they grow on a single plant?” Fatty changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’ve never seen something like this, right? This was something I crossbred after a hundred years of trial using Sunremanent Lotus and Profound Ice Lotus. It is an Icefire Lotus that holds both the attribute of ice and fire. How’s that, it’s a great name, right?” Flame Ruler said proudly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great name my ass. </span></i><span style>Fatty thought to himself, but didn’t dare to say it out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now. Little fatty, I’m in a good mood today, so I talked a bit more with you. You can die now,” Just as Fatty was pondering how to get some benefits, Flame Ruler immediately changed his tone and was going to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, I’ve got a question,” Fatty yammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Hurry up,” Flame Ruler replied impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What effects does this Icefire Lotus have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What effects? It has great effects!” A look of pride filled Flame Ruler’s face. “Did you know? I have a dream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dream? What dream?” Fatty asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My dream is to leave this shitty place, then...” Flame Ruler clasped his hands in front of his chest with a dreamy look. “Then take a cold bath at the bottom of the East Ocean. Ahahaha. Little fatty, do you think that my dream is grand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty nearly coughed up a mouthful of blood, while wobbling. </span><i><span style>You’re a fire monster, why the heck are you thinking about taking a bath in the East Ocean…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What happened? Did you get shocked by my grand dream? Flame Ruler asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro. Seriously, bro, your dream is way too grand,” Fatty gave the monster a thumbs-up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. No matter what, I’m a monster with a dream!” Flame Emperor puffed up his chest. “if it wasn’t for Lord Vermillion Bird sealing me here, then I would already be traveling the world! Who would even want to stay in this shitty place for several hundred years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You were sealed here by Lord Vermillion Bird?” Fatty exclaimed. </span><i><span style>Vermillion Bird? That’s one of the four guardian beats of the Chinese region! It is a super existence that is just below a super divine beast!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I wasn’t really sealed,” Flame Ruler straightened his face. “Little fatty, you know too much, hurry up and die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, no. I’ve still got more questions!” Fatty waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why the heck do you have so many questions?” Flame Ruler said impatiently. “Just go and die. Don’t make me do it myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t! Big bro, we’ve still got a lot more things to talk about,” Fatty shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up. Since you called me big bro so earnestly, then I shall give you another chance,” Flame Ruler said proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, can you tell me if you have the skill book of the Basic Elemental Walk = Firewalk?” Fatty asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s that? Basic Elemental Walk = Firewalk? I’ve never heard of it,” Flame Ruler replied. “My Firewalk is the greatest Elemental Walk in the world. Mm, of course, Lord Vermillion Bird’s doesn’t count. We can’t beat her, but Basic Elemental Walk? I’ve never been interested in something like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty felt rather conflicted when he heard that. He was happy because he no longer needed to try and kill this monster, but he was sad because he wasn’t sure where he was going to go and find the skill book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, then when are you going to take a bath in the East Ocean? Take me too. Let me watch Big Bro’s unparalleled greatness,” Fatty tried to buy more time as he thought about how to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Uhm,” Flame Ruler suddenly felt a bit awkward as he whispered. “I can’t leave this place right now.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Got it! </span></i><span style>Fatty’s eyes lit up. </span><i><span style>Could I actually get a mission here?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, do you have some troubles? Don’t worry, tell little bro about it. Little bro will take care of it for you,” Fatty patted his chest, but nearly fell down due to the exaggerated movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” Flame Ruler puffed out a spark from his nostril. “Stop kidding me, what can you do when I can’t do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, don’t look down on me. I can enter the Black Tortoise City's City Lord Manor at will,” Fatty shamelessly turned entering twice into entering at will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Flame Ruler exclaimed. </span><i><span style>That Black Tortoise is on the same level as the Vermillion Bird. The city lord of Black Tortoise City has an almost unmatched power, he can disregard even some of the officials in the royal palace. If I can get acquainted with him, then…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t believe me, then look, this is the mission his lordship issued me in person,” Fatty revealed the mission City Lord Lin Xi issued him, which turned him into a laborer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, little bro, big bro really does have something that I would like to trouble you with.” </span><i><span style>Damn, monsters with higher intelligence aren’t a good thing, he is even more of a sleaze than me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell little bro anything you want. I will definitely solve it for you,” Fatty his chest. This time, he didn’t dare to move too much for fear of falling into the lava.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Little Bro, you know that Lord Vermillion Bird sealed me here so that I can rule over the fire monsters here. I’ve been working hard here for several hundred years, so my efforts are worth something, right? And even if they aren’t, I am like uhm… worn out, right? Or at least injured, right? Look, can you help Big Bro a bit and get me out of here? The Fire Valley is tiny, Big Bro’s already sick of his place, I’ve not interested in anything here anymore. So, how about helping Big Bro?” Flame Ruler smiled coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… I’m not familiar with Lord Vermillion Bird,” Fatty frowned and frowned it like he was familiar with another guardian beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to trouble her,” Flame Ruler shook his head. “Lord Vermillion Bird has many things to do, we should not trouble her. All you have to do is help me capture a fire monster at Level 60 or above. I can transfer the seal over to it, then leave this place. How about that? It’s not too hard, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just a small thing,” Fatty shook his hand, then thought about the Fire Cloud King pet he has in his inventory. </span><i><span style>Even if I can’t capture anything, I can raise one!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yay, then let Big Bro thank you first,” Flame Ruler was overjoyed. “Ahh, my dream can finally come true. East Ocean, wait for me!”</span></p>
