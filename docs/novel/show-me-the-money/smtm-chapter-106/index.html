 <p><span style>Chapter 106 – Vengeful Crypt Ghoul</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty was utterly speechless. </span><i><span style>That was a Phantasm Ghost Claw earlier and now we have two Phantasm Leg Bones. Are </span></i><b><i>all </i></b><i><span style>of the Phantasm Ghost King’s body parts like this? He might as well come out completely.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But wait, the Phantasm Ghost King is still sealed… How did his body parts get out of there?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When the two leg bones dived into the piles of bones on the ground, the piles seemed to shake a bit before growing silent. Fatty did not bother digging through the piles to search for them. After all, they were all bones, so Fatty wouldn’t be able to recognize the two leg bones if they remained stationary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty needed half a day to get to where Hamlet indicated, so Fatty found a relatively safe spot to log off, then rested a bit before continuing on with his journey. During those times, several guild masters sent him messages that asked him for help to kill boss monsters, but he rejected them all. He was still not finished with his mission yet. He knew he wouldn’t meet a good end if Lin Xi was to find out if he returned empty-handed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Fatty’s level was higher, he would actually be able to walk around most of the places inside the Ancient Battlefield just using stealth. However, his level was way too low. Although it was the level of the best players currently, it was incomparably low for a zone like the Ancient Battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty only felt more and more shocked as he walked deeper into the Ancient Battlefield. The barren grounds, piles of bones and wandering monsters sent chills down his spine. Any monster was able to easily kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, he did have Wheat, who “possessed bravery and loyalty.” Wheat would tearfully and loyally lure the monsters away, providing a chance for Fatty to sneak away. Yet, after Fatty escapes from one, more often than not, another monster would appear…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty turned his head back at the sounds coming from behind him. Nothing. He took a few steps forward as he focused on his back, but there really wasn’t anything else. He stood still for a while and waited in confusion, but still… Nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty finally calmed down, then indicated for Wheat to continue to lead the way. However, some noise was heard coming from behind him once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, attack,” Fatty turned back and ordered Wheat to cast Scatterstone Rain a few meters behind him. Several dozen stalagmites flew up and scattered the bones on the ground, but that was it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s strange. Could it be the wind? </span></i><span style>Fatty looked around. The mists continued to spiral in their surroundings, but he saw nothing living except Wheat and him. There wasn’t even a single monster around.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whatever, I’ll wait for it to come out</span></i><span style>. Fatty ordered Wheat to continue to lead the way. Just like Fatty had predicted, the mysterious noise behind him sounded out very soon. This time, Fatty did not stop to hesitate and continued onwards without looking back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The noise sounded like a person cracking bones on the ground as they stepped on them. Since the Ancient Battlefield was covered in bones and the sound of Fatty’s footsteps sounded ever so similar, he was soon unable to distinguish whether a sound was coming from him or from something else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few hours and multiple near-death experiences after being discovered by monsters a few times, he finally saw where the tombstones Hamlet referred to was. Meanwhile, the noises behind him did not stop. Just like before, the noises seemed to continue as he walked, but would fade once he stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The countless tombstones seemed to scatter over a very large area that extended into the mists. Many of them have fallen sideways as they remained stabbed into the ground. The words on them seemed to have faded in the winds of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hamlet only noticed the strange light by chance and ran away before observing more carefully. Even though it seemed like the light from Holy Spirit Stones, Hamlet also emphasized that he was not a hundred percent certain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty frowned. The light was coming out from underneath various tombstones. </span><i><span style>Am I supposed to dig all of them out of the ground?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“May Buddha preserve us. Forgive me for this,” Fatty chose a tombstone, muttered to himself, then swung down hard with his small pickaxe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the pickaxe dug out the soil, the bones buried underneath were revealed. Just as he raised his pickaxe up for another swing, a huge crack appeared in the ground. A arm wearing a wrist guard reached out and grabbed the side of the crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck my luck,” Fatty put his pickaxe away and took out Fang to attack it a few times before the monster crawled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the weapon holding hand reached out from the ground as well. Then, a head wearing a black helmet appeared out of the ground with a push. The monster let out a huge roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar your ass,” Fatty kicked the monster’s chin, close its mouth before it could even finish its scream. At the same time, the monster’s health by also dropped by a significant amount.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hey, this is pretty good. </span></i><span style>Fatty was pretty happy. </span><i><span style>This is a great spot for farming if I can slice away at their health before they manage to come out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty swung Fang up and down, the monster’s health bar steadily dropped. As he was doing so, the monster could only roar and wave its weapon futilely as everything below its chest was still in the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Wheat also seemed to be enjoying himself. Although the little fellow was extremely cowardly, it was even more adept at beating a dog when its down. At its original size, Wheat was already the size of a calf already reaching level 30. He opened its mouth and shot a Howling Bullet. Previously at Level 20, it was only the size of a large bowl, but now, the bullet was the size of a soccer ball. It dealt even more damage to the monster than Fatty!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Fatty was about to finish the monster off, it suddenly let go of its hands and shrunk back into the hand. </span><i><span style>Shit, now I can’t reach it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty took a few steps closer and looked down the crack. He saw the monster hiding underneath the ground and look back at him with its blood red eyes, as if it was waiting for Fatty to come down so that it would return the favor to Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Appraisal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Vengeful Crypt Ghoul</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: ???</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahaha. Wheat, continue,” Fatty commanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat was clearly excited to continue its assault on a monster that couldn’t fight back. Before Fatty gave the orders of how to attack, it smacked its front paws against the ground, creating several large stalagmites underneath the monster to pierce it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>ROAR.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That roar sounded extremely pitiful. Fatty looked at Wheat enviously with a gulp. </span><i><span style>That’s such a great ability, if Lord Fatty had the skill, then I would be able to stab whoever I want in the ass! That would be so amazing! Who would even dare to piss Lord Fatty of then? </span></i><span style>This was the first time Fatty regretted being a player.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crypt ghoul repeatedly cried in franticness when it’s lower half was impaled by stalagmites. Since it was getting sliced when trying to get up and getting impaled when it remained underground, the Vengeful Crypt Ghoul’s pitiful AI was completely unsure of what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stab its ass! Rape its ass! I will be kicking that monster’s ass!” Fatty sung and looked around for Holy Spirit Stones, while Wheat continued to attack the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the noise that had followed Fatty all the way over sounded out again. Fatty was already certain that something had been following him for a long time, but he really wasn’t bothered to react. Instead, he wanted to see just what it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the Vengeful Crypt Ghoul was still suffering a beating from Wheat. Since Wheat’s attack was able to break through its defense and it could not fight back, it was eventually going to die no matter how high its level was; how much health it had; and how high its defense actually was. What’s more, Wheat did not limit itself to only casting Scatterstone Rain. Instead, it ran over to the crack and cast Howling Bullets while Scatterstone Rain is on cooldown. At one point, it even smacked the monster with its claw whenever it tried to get back out of the crack in frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Wheat was enjoying itself, the Vengeful Crypt Ghoul was roaring in anger. After a dozen or minutes of being beaten senseless, it finally lost its cling onto life and died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty took a look at his experience bar. To his surprise, the death of the Crypt Ghoul filled it up by 1%. </span><i><span style>This makes leveling better here than in Black Tortoise City!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He also bent down looked into the crack. All of the drops were under the monster’s corpse’s, so he would have to drag the monster out first. </span><i><span style>Oh well, I’ve got Wheat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, go.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahh, I don’t even have to worry about back pains or leg pains anymore. It’s also so much easier to kill monsters with Wheat around.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat shrunk its body, crawled underneath the Vengeful Crypt Ghoul and dragged the drops out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, that’s like a few hundred gold coins! Man, it was rich! </span></i><span style>The other drop item was a wrist guard. As usual, Fatty used Appraisal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Wrist Guard</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silver Set Item</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Set</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wrist Guard</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level Requirement: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defense: 50</span></p>
 <p><span style>STR: +23</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Fatty encountered a set item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put the item away, then happily went over to the next tombstone and swung his pickaxe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty managed to successfully dig up quite a few Vengeful Crypt Ghouls, but… He did end up in bad spots at times, such as…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wheat, go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty hooked a Vengeful Crypt Ghoul out with his pickaxe and sat down on the side as he waited for Wheat to kill it. Wheat also got more and more excited, perhaps because it has always been the target of monsters chasing after it and this was the first time it was in such a beneficial situation. Not making use of it would shame its identity as a rat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Vengeful Crypt Ghoul was luckier than previous ones. Although it lost most of its health, it still managed to crawl out from its tomb. While the Vengeful Crypt Ghouls seemed rather harmless when stuck in the ground, it’s prowess on the ground was definitely not to be taken lightly. A single swing of its blade took out more than half of Wheat’s health!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wheat also reacted true to its nature and burrowed back into the earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*CK!” Fatty could only curse as the Vengeful Crypt Ghoul approached him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m afraid!?” Fatty shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to enter stealth, he felt a pain on his backside as a force sent him falling towards the Vengeful Crypt Ghoul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty took a glance back and saw…. Two white legs seemingly dancing behind him.</span></p>
