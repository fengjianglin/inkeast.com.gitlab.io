 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

The explosion last night had left a great impact on him, and he had forgotten about the incident with Ye Guyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Xuan, the power I unleashed yesterday can be said to be my third martial soul. However, I don’t think this power comes from our world.” Then, he explained Electrolux’s origins to Elder Xuan in a way he could understand. At this moment, there was no way he could hide the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with Elder Xuan’s experience, he was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A sorcerer. A profession in another world? This…” Elder Xuan regained his senses after a long while. Helplessly, he patted Huo Yuhao’s shoulder and said, “Yuhao, while your power is unique, you should know what it means to be an evil soul master on this continent. The cooperation between the Sun Moon Empire and the evil soul masters infuriates every soul master. Your power, however, appears similar to those of evil soul masters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Elder Xuan, I understand what you mean. I won’t use this power casually. I won’t even use it with my original appearance. The participant of the Radiant City Elite Soul Engineering Tournament was Tang Wu, not Huo Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan sighed in relief and said, “It’s good that you understand. Your Spirit Eyes and Ice Jade Empress Scorpion are powerful enough. Train them well. Can you release Ye Guyi now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao tried, but then shook his head and said, “The invisible power here is too strong. I can’t communicate with the spectral demiplane Teacher Electrolux left me. However, she’ll be in no danger inside the demiplane. I’ve already tried to protect her as much as I could. With her powers, she can go without food for at least half a month.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan nodded and said, “Good job. If we can leave this place, we must protect this child with the Holy Angel martial soul. In the future, she will become one of the main forces of resistance against the Holy Ghost Church. Yuhao, my attitude yesterday was wrong. When I saw such a huge explosion, coupled with your evil soul master-like power, I started to doubt you. Then, I gave it more thought. You were chosen by Elder Mu, how can be there anything wrong with you? However, you must remember that no matter where you are, no matter what you experience, no matter what happens to you, you must be true to yourself. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded vigorously and said, “I will, Elder Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan smiled slightly and said, “Now that we’re in a death trap, please be careful. Go and have a bite.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that they had resolved this small ‘conflict’, Elder Xuan was in a much better mood. Together with Huo Yuhao, they walked back into the main camp. Everyone had finished their meals by now, and were re-grouping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through Elder Xuan’s arrangements, everyone was divided into three groups. Among them, Shrek’s Seven Monsters were a group by themselves. They were led by Elder Xuan. The team from Shrek split into two groups. Wang Qiu’er, Zhang Lexuan, and the main fighting force of the team from Shrek were in one team. They were led by the Martial God Douluo Xian Lin’er. The remaining substitutes, along with the Tang Sect’s substitutes and Gao Dalou, Ji Juechen, Jing Ziyan, and Nan Qiuqiu, formed the biggest group. The other four Titled Douluo from Shrek Academy were in charge of them. Among these four Titled Douluo, two of them were elders from the Sea God’s Pavilion with the strength of Transcendent Douluo. They were the strongest team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan walked with Shrek’s Seven Monsters at the front. Xian Lin’er led the second group in the center. The four Titled Douluo and the third group stayed at the back. All of the groups had to &nbsp;be able to communicate verbally with each other so that they would not be too far apart. They also tried to leave markings on more distinctive plants as they passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a dumb plan, but it was also their only plan. After they left their marks on all the plants, any plant with no marks would indicate a brand-new direction. This was how they moved forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they moved forward, they had to be careful. They were not fast, and while the area five meters above the ground was not shrouded with a dense fog, there was still a light fog. Coupled with the thick vegetation, they could only see about ten meters ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire forest was so quiet it was terrifying. It was as if there was nothing alive there. This silence was so creepy that it terrified everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin now felt that his previous suggestion had been very stupid. The silence would have been a lot scarier had they separated, to the point whereby it might drive them mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They walked forward, and soon, two hours had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao walked directly behind Elder Xuan. This was done upon his request. Suddenly, he turned to Elder Xuan and asked, “Elder Xuan, do you feel that this feels different from last night? We seem to be on a path with no return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan nodded and said, “I have the same feeling too. Right now, the path is different from the path yesterday, which made us walk in circles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This could be good news. Now that there was no chance of heading back, they would surely find a possible exit as long as they headed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They continued to walk forward. After two more hours, Elder Xuan was sure they were no longer walking around in circles. Throughout their journey, they did not see any repeated scenery. Furthermore, they did not see the marks which they were leaving on the plants again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While they could not fly, and they could not use their spiritual power for long-range detection, there was a chance that they could walk out of here. This made them content.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, it was already noon. The fog made their surroundings extremely blurry. The air felt heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan ordered everyone to take a break here. They set up camp like last night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The advantage of numbers demonstrated itself. At the very least, the silence of the forest did not terrify them too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For those with storage-type soul tools, they brought more than enough food. The only ones with no food were those from the Tang Sect. They only had rare metals in their storage-type soul tools…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were only able to eat by asking the elders for some food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan sat with Shrek’s Seven Monsters. As he ate his favorite chicken drumstick, he said, “According to the size of the Western Mountain, we should be able to leave this place in one more day if we continue to walk at our current speed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said, “Let’s hope that this is the case, but…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he did not say it, everyone understood what he meant. The Sun Moon Empire brought them here for a reason. How could they escape so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan looked at him and said, “There’s no ‘but’. Right now, we can only walk step-by-step. With our food and water supply, we can last ten days. If we still can’t get out by then…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Elder Xuan’s face turned severe. He raised his head to look at the sky. Everyone knew what he meant. If they still couldn’t escape, he would risk it all and attempt to fly. Perhaps there was still a sliver of hope there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they spoke, danger suddenly appeared around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone subconsciously looked in one direction. Then, a gold and silver light surged toward them like a wave. Instantly, it covered every single one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone unleashed their most powerful protective skills simultaneously. However, this all-encompassing light did not clash with them. In their hearts, however, they all sensed that something was amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They looked at each other. They were all covered with a layer of faint gold and silver light. For the younger members of Shrek Academy, their faces turned dismal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The unknown was the scariest. No one knew what was going on, and hence, there was no way to resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they quickly sensed that something was amiss. A powerful attractive force came along with the silver and gold light. The weaker ones were instantly pulled flying in one direction.</span></p>
