The changes came too suddenly, but it changed the outcome of the fight.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Bei Bei, who was the most familiar with Xu Sanshi, didn’t know that this good friend of his had such a capability. No one would also have expected that this soul skill would become Xu Sanshi’s trademark. It had a frightening strength that was almost irresistible. Its name was Descent of the Xuanwu.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an additional power that the Xuanwu Shield possessed. However, Xu Sanshi could only attack within close range, as he could not fully control the shield yet. Furthermore, the area that he could cover was very small, and he had only one chance. Once his opponent dodged this attack, he would no longer possess any chance of winning.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s why he waited. When his opponent’s flashing sword stabbed into his right chest that he intentionally exposed, he knew that the opportunity had arrived.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An lowered his guard for an instant after he got what he wanted and slowed down by a beat. This gave Xu Sanshi an opportunity to unleash an all-out strike towards him.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The flashing lightning from the sword didn’t cause any harm to Xu Sanshi. Only the sword blade that stabbed right through him left him in intense pain.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Water conducts electricity. Moreover, Xu Sanshi had the Xuanwu Shield. He could suppress his opponent completely using his martial soul. That’s why the lightning from the sword was conducted out from his body by his water-type soul power. It wasn’t that easy to harm a defense-type soul master.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An’s first reaction to being engulfed by the water ripple was to burst out of it. He wanted to retract his sword, but he couldn’t do it anymore. Xu Sanshi tightened his muscles and both his hands grabbed the sword blade very tightly.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An had no choice but to let go of his sword since strength was not his forte. He subdued with his speed, thus it was imperative for him not to get caught.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bolts of lightning shone on his other sword, and an intense boom reverberated from it.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Impure water conducts electricity, and the radiance from the Xuanwu Shield contained traces of water.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The viscous fluid prevented Chen An, a Class 5 soul engineer and soul king, from escaping.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fresh blood flowed down Xu Sanshi’s chest and palms as he pulled the flashing sword from his chest and glared coldly at the entrapped Chen An, who was surrounded by the black radiance converted from the Xuanwu Shield.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The illusory Xuanwu figure behind Xu Sanshi turned into another Xuanwu Shield as the black radiance flashed. The snake’s eyes on the shield then shot out a red light, causing the black radiance trapping Chen An to turn red in an instant.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop.” The Heavenfiend Douluo stepped forward and attempted to stop Xu Sanshi’s attack.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Xuanwu Shield’s innate offensive method was too weird . The Heavenfiend Douluo erected a layer of light to segregate the both of them and extended his hand to pull Chen An out. However, he quickly retracted his hand when he extended it into the red fluid, as if he was shocked.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenfiend Douluo’s expression had changed because of the terrifying feeling he’d experienced.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His spirit shook from the Xuanwu’s aura of desolation. After that, he watched as Chen An disappeared within the red fluid. Or rather, he melted in the fluid.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strike was no longer just inflicted with Xu Sanshi’s strength. He’d become the intermediary between the Xuanwu that controlled the water and earth elements.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were only three ways of preventing this blow from landing. The first was to avoid being struck by the ball of black light converted from the Xuanwu Shield. The radius of that ball of black light was only 3 meters, and it could only be used once every 3 days, just like Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao’s martial soul fusion skill. Furthermore, it had to be unleashed in the awakened Xuanwu form.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second way was to take Xu Sanshi down before the Descent of the Xuanwu was fully unleashed. This was the only way to end his ritual of summoning the Descent of the Xuanwu.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last way was to suppress the Xuanwu with one’s martial soul. However, this was very difficult.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"></span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Xu Sanshi’s first time using this innate skill, or rather this bloodline skill. Chen An was also the first sacrificial offering towards the Descent of Xuanwu.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ahhh—” Sorrowful moans rang from below the stage. Everyone from the Sun Moon team was about to go crazy. Their teacher was even about to rush up the competition stage.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the third one! This was the third member from their team that had perished in the tournament! How could this be? Their teacher was absolutely flustered now. There was no way he could account to the dean after three of the academy’s outstanding talents had been killed!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi didn’t see all this. Once Chen An was assimilated by the red radiance, he collapsed himself and passed out. The burden on him was even greater this time; he wasn’t acting anymore.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d managed to beat two soul kings as a soul ancestor. He’d already contributed a lot to Shrek’s glory. Furthermore, he was only a defense-type soul master!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defensive barriers on the competition stage were projected inwards. This was to prevent any outflow of powers from the stage, and the barriers only exerted a unidirectional force. That was why it was very easy for everyone from the Sun Moon team to barge up the stage towards Xu Sanshi.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop!” The Heavenfiend Douluo shouted. Even though he felt gloomy, he still had to restrain the Sun Moon team, as he was the referee.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon team could no longer hold back as they were too emotional. Countless soul tool rays shot towards Xu Sanshi, who’d collapsed to the ground.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a brazen figure appeared at the center of the stage at this point, and all of the rays of light were instantaneously dispersed.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of formless yellow seemed to spread in the air. Everyone on the stage, including the Heavenfiend Douluo, seemed to have been frozen in place, and all of their actions stopped.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure on the stage held onto his wine gourd and calmly downed a mouthful of wine. He peacefully looked at everyone from the Sun Moon team peacefully.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trying to revolt?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These simple words of his seemed to heavily strike the minds of everyone from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. None of them could speak at this moment.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, the person that had appeared onstage and caused everyone to be petrified was the Taotie Douluo, Elder Xuan.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said indifferently, “The history of the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament can be traced back more than 10,000 years. Even when the Martial Soul Hall controlled all the soul masters on the continent, the tournament has never been disrupted before. Please find the referee if someone has been killed and you want to get even. According to the rules, all competing members have to give their all in order to display their true abilities. Who can hold back after they’ve given their all? Furthermore, the referee is in charge of monitoring the competition. If someone dies, the referee is the one at fault. What has that got to do with our team member? If anyone intends to break this ten thousand year-old rule, they can come find me.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned around and walked towards Xu Sanshi as he spoke, then bent down and lifted Xu Sanshi up. A gentle yellow radiance was injected into Xu Sanshi’s body, which immediately sorted him out. It also sealed the veins where his wounds were located.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenfiend Douluo Huang Jinxu was extremely depressed after hearing this. Subtle streaks of black seemed to droop from his forehead.</span></p>

Oh yes, I don’t care if the others die, but if these little fellows die, I can’t guarantee that I won’t go crazy. I don’t think there’s anyone here who can stop me if I go crazy.”</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The students still wanted to protest, but their teacher reached out his hand and stopped them.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher, we’re just going to leave things like this? We…” Ma Rulong protested indignantly.</span></p>

He’s the strongest in Shrek Academy, and he’s also one of the top 5 on the continent. His title is Taotie, and he’s a Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo. He has frightening power close to that of an Ultimate Douluo. If he goes crazy, he could lay waste to this city. Even the Hallmaster wouldn’t dare to challenge him if he were here. No one expected him to appear in today’s finals.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he spoke, it was as if everyone from the Sun Moon team had been splashed with a basin of ice water. They all felt a chill in their hearts.</span></p>

But Rank 98 was too high of a figure for them; it was beyond their knowledge. In the Sun Moon Empire, there wasn’t a single Transcendent Douluo! Rank 98 was even more ridiculous.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are we really going to leave it just like that?” Xiao Hongchen asked indignantly.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their teacher was pale as he said, “Taotie may be very strong, but he cares about his own face. So long as we don’t annoy him, he won’t do anything to us. He won’t disrupt the tournament as long as things go according to the rules either. Let’s all leave the stage. He’s also right in that that it’s largely the referee’s fault that our team members were killed. The academy will seek redress for this matter.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been proven that a Transcendent Douluo was enough to suppress everyone. Even the Star Luo Emperor and White Tiger Duke didn’t comment, instead only watching from afar. The Star Luo Emperor, Xu Jiawei, revealed a pensive look, whereas the White Tiger Duke furrowed his brows and seemed to be thinking of something.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenfiend Douluo was very proud and withdrawn. If it were someone else, he would have retaliated even though it was in front of 100,000 spectators. However, he didn’t dare do so in front of Elder Xuan. That was because he had sparred with Elder Xuan 20 years ago, and hadn’t fared much better than a certain Protector Douluo from the Star Luo Empire’s royal family…</span></p>
