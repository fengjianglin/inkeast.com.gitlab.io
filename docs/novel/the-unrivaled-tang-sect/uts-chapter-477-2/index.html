 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a powerful Class 9 soul tool that the Fire Phoenix Douluo had personally created. It was called Soaring Phoenix, and was a pure offensive soul tool. It could reach a temperature of over a thousand degrees Celsius, and possessed great explosive strength. It could only be used once before it became useless, but it was much more powerful than most ordinary Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells. However, its shortcoming was that it couldn’t reach as far as a stationary soul cannon shell. However, it was very suitable for usage within a fixed region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tai Tan Snowdevil King was slightly stunned when he saw the fire phoenix rising into the sky. Although it wasn’t flying towards him, he could still sense the immense soul power undulations it emitted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Can a human really unleash such an attack? That human isn’t that strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao mentioned that humans are capable of inventing weapons. This must be one of them. It’s indeed strong!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, the Tai Tan Snowdevil King had looked down on humans. However, his opinion slowly changed when he realized that his previous two attacks couldn’t topple the linked defensive barrier, and after he saw the rising fire phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge ball in the sky was only five hundred meters from the ground now. At this moment, the Soaring Phoenix blew apart, and received its attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blue and fiery-red formed two parallel lines in the air. These parallel lines expanded suddenly, and a region covering hundreds of square kilometers was instantly engulfed by these two colors. Ice and fire raged as they battled with each other. It was also at this moment that the soul engineers of the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion finally entered their soul formation, and started to control their large offensive soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Between ice and fire, fire was evidently being drained more quickly. After all, this was the ice plains of the Extreme North! In this extremely cold part of the world, all fire-type abilities were greatly diminished. This process was continuous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this moment that a ball of icy-blue light suddenly drilled out from the fire and instantly crashed down, landing directly within the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion’s soul formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it hit the ground, the light dispersed, revealing a figure. Wasn’t this Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao landed, his body immediately turned illusory. The huge figure that had descended from the sky earlier was naturally the Ice Bear King. Huo Yuhao had already guessed that the Phoenix Soul Engineer would have some way of tackling him, given their abilities. At the same time, he was also adapting to the situation. Everything, including the Tai Tan Snowdevil King and the Tai Tan Snowdevils’ attacks, was under his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A white halo immediately spread after he concealed his body with his Imitation. At the same time, a golden whirlpool appeared above the Fire Phoenix Douluo’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were his third and fourth soul skills, Mass Enfeeblement and Spiritual Confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of cultivation, Huo Yuhao couldn’t compare to the Fire Phoenix Douluo. However, his immense spiritual power could. Under the effect of his spiritual soul core, he unleashed two soul skills. Suddenly, the Fire Phoenix Douluo was sent into a momentary trance. Within this soul formation, all the soul engineers felt as if their soul power had leaked out of their bodies. A strong sense of weakness quickly caused them to turn dizzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement, a huge vertical eye appeared at the center of the soul formation, and the space within the soul formation immediately distorted. Clearly no sound was made, but every soul engineer felt as if deafening thunder had sounded in their ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had unleashed his Martial Soul True Body, the Demonic Eyes of the Asura, along with his Spiritual Blast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few spiritual-type soul skills were unleashed simultaneously. All the soul engineers from the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion staggered after being hit by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Blast. Huo Yuhao didn’t unleash the full power of his Spiritual Blast because he wanted to maximize the area it covered. Otherwise, some of the soul engineers who were closest to him would have been blown apart from the blast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stomped the ground with his right foot as the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass surfaced above his head. The ground shook, and countless ice spikes formed a dazzling icy flower with Huo Yuhao’s body at the center. It was the Star Anise Omnithrust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the enhancement of the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass, the Star Anise Omnithrust was unleashed with full force. The soul engineers all had automated protective barriers on their bodies. They were only flung away by the Star Anise Omnithrust, but the soul formation that was deployed wasn’t protected by a defensive barrier! Or rather, without any soul engineers controlling it, there was no way the soul formation could be protected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul tools in this formation were rather tough. Even when hit by the Star Anise Omnithrust, only small parts of them were damaged. However, they were all knocked over by the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s series of attacks didn’t cause too much harm to the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. However, it completely suppressed the soul formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ju Zi saw that huge vertical eye, she knew who was here. Huo Yuhao was simply too quick. After he unleashed his Spiritual Blast, he returned to his original form almost instantly. When he stomped with his right leg, he was just looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, countless ice spikes were unleashed. Around the perimeter, several massive figures changed into their original forms after a series of collisions. The powerful Tai Tan Snowdevils had already charged into the base with the help of the blizzard and Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stood arrogantly in the center of the soul formation. When Ju Zi finally grit her teeth and gave the order to all the soul engineers to focus their attacks on Huo Yuhao, another huge figure fell from the sky, shielding him. A giant ice wall absorbed all the attacks. At this moment, these soul engineers couldn’t even think about attacking Huo Yuhao without their soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao remained where he was. On his forehead, his Eye of Destiny had already opened. Sunray patterns filled his forehead. Right now, he was at the center of the battlefield. Whether it was the Ice Bear King, the Tai Tan Snowdevil King, or the Tai Tan Snowdevils, they were all within range of his Spiritual Detection Sharing. The entire battlefield had been completely engulfed by his Spiritual Detection. Every Tai Tan Snowdevil was under his command, including the Tai Tan Snowdevil King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tai Tan Snowdevils didn’t kill the ordinary soldiers. Instead, they were furiously destroying all the structures. All the facilities that the Sun Moon Empire had tirelessly built to mine rare metals were torn apart under the hands of these Tai Tan Snowdevils. Metal pieces were flying everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took the soul engineers in the soul formation some effort before they shook off the effects of Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement, Spiritual Blast, and Star Anise Omnithrust. By then, they discovered that they couldn’t do anything at all. The Ice Bear King released a strong chilling aura from his body as he stood within the soul formation. All the soul tools were quickly being frozensolid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was already showing mercy. After all, the soul engineers in the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion were women. If he had followed his attacks up with his Ice Explosion Technique, those with lower cultivations would have been critically hurt. However, he didn’t want to kill too many people, which stopped him from doing that. All the soul tools were just frozen under the control of the Ice Bear King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul engineers could only quickly flee in all directions, scattered from one another. Even if they could attack, how could they possibly threaten the Ice Bear King?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi paled. When Huo Yuhao led the Ice Bear King to occupy the soul formation, she knew that she had already lost this battle. Without the soul formation, she couldn’t possibly threaten the Tai Tan Snowdevils, even if she could survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Tai Tan Snowdevils were simply too scary. Class 4 and 5 soul tools were ineffective against them. Their destructive abilities had already destroyed all the mining facilities in and around the base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Tai Tan Snowdevils had massive limbs and sharp claws. Even the toughest metals seemed like paper in front of them. Right now, more than a hundred Tai Tan Snowdevils were gathering towards the center. The Tai Tan Snowdevil King had even grabbed another thick metal pillar, and smashed it against the linked defensive formation in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi grit her teeth and couldn’t help but think,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow is heartless. I’ve been worrying over him for so long, but he brought me such a huge ‘surprise’ with his return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t know what Ju Zi was thinking about. Things had reached such a stage that the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion was clearly unable to clean up the mess anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao jumped onto the Ice Bear King’s back. The Ice Bear King roared into the sky. Countless ice picks danced in the air and shot straight towards the linked defensive formation. The Ice Bear King turned around quickly and charged away with Huo Yuhao on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s leaving? He’s leaving just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was stunned. When she saw the frozen soul formation on the ground, she heaved a sigh of relief. Although they had suffered heavy losses this time, they had still managed to preserve their soul formation. This meant that she still had a chance of making a comeback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this thought only lasted for a second before she was brought back to the harsh realities of life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tremendous booms started resonating through the air. Explosions sounded from the soul formation, one after another. The huge soul tools were blown apart, and debris scattered in the air. Bits of metal flew everywhere, and the core formation blew apart, generating an even louder explosion. The entire soul formation seemed like it had been ignited as it kept on exploding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice Explosion Technique!</span></p>
