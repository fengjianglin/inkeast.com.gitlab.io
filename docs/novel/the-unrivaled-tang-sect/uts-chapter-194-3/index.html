All four powerful beings in Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea who were typically in deep slumber all woke up, and everyone started to panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t panic everyone, let’s think of solutions.” Huo Yuhao took a deep breath. He was extremely composed at this moment, and even though he didn’t know what was going on, he immediately used his soul power to forcefully control the turbulent soul power within his body. He still didn’t know how to resist the powerful gravitational force, but he could at least delay the hysterical absorption speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress recovered after Huo Yuhao’s reminder, and she tried her best to close her seal within Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the suction force was simply too strong, to the point where the Ice Empress’ attempts to control it were futile. She was slowing the absorption speed, but there was no way she could close her seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vast origin energy of heaven and earth contained in the Icejade Bed beneath him was being extracted rapidly, and it was getting faster. The golden pearl was spinning at such a speed that Huo Yuhao really couldn’t tolerate it anymore. He could see that his core was still swelling, and the vast energies being swallowed away were causing it to grow larger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux contemplated momentarily, then said, “I think I understand. Snow Lady, I will help you suppress it. The sealed origin power seems to have been ignited by the origin energy of heaven and earth contained in the Frigid Jade Essence Bed. We’re in big trouble now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ignited what?” The Snow Lady asked, confused. She was the golden pearl’s owner, but she had no idea what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux lowered his voice and said, “There is no question – both you and the Ice Empress are the most powerful ice-type soul beasts in the world, and your powers are very close to the upper limits of coldness. Once coldness reaches its upper limit, it’s theoretically possible for a qualitative change to happen, and the Ultimate Ice will be converted into Ultimate Fire. The coldest energies will be converted into frightening, scorching energies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? How is that possible? I have never felt something like this before.” Within Huo Yuhao’s turbulent spiritual sea, the Snow Lady looked at Electrolux with a face of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress was focusing all her attention on controlling the seal, so she couldn’t speak. However, she was looking at Electrolux with the same inconceivable and unfathomable expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux said, “It doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist if you haven’t felt it before, that’s only because your cultivations are too low. Grasping the transmutation of Ultimate types from one extremity to another can only be controlled by divine sense. I once possessed part of that power, but what I had was the conversion of extreme light into extreme darkness, and hence came the name Divine Law of Necromancy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do we do now then?” the Snow Lady asked urgently. “Part of my consciousness and origin power are sealed inside the snow pearl, and I have no way of controlling the violence within it. If this is allowed to continue, it will reach a size so big that it will detonate. At that point, us and even the mountain range around us will be flattened by the terrifying force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux laughed bitterly and said, “There’s nothing I can do even though I know what’s going on. Your strength is considered sufficiently powerful in this world, and when this power undergoes a transmutation, it are also compressed to the highest possible level. It is so intricate and compact that it can trigger the polar extremes. Because your reincarnation wasn’t successful, and your body was damaged, you weren’t able to control and compress your power. I used a special curse and borrowed Yuhao’s spiritual power to seal your compressed power. When Yuhao can control this spiritual power by himself one day, then he will be able to absorb a little of your vast compressed power that’s sealed away. Even though much will leak away, at least it won’t trigger an explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even I couldn’t predict today’s circumstance – I never expected that something else in this world shared the same origin power as you. The origin energy of heaven and earth contained within the jade essence is very similar to yours. Your control of the extremely compressed and sealed origin power has always been unstable because you left your consciousness. It was stimulated by the outer world’s origin energy of heaven and earth, so it would naturally hope to absorb this immense power into itself. It began to react violently under such circumstances, and the polar extreme has occurred. It has become like a bomb, and it’s rapidly swelling as it absorbs, so the extreme coldness is starting to transmute into the opposite extreme, and this power will expand even more. This explosion will have the terrifying power of a divine being, and both me and you guys will…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm was worried. He had wracked his brains and done everything he could to merge with Huo Yuhao, and had finally seen the light at the end of the tunnel. This sudden calamity stunned the lazy bug as he said, “Stop saying that, Elder Yi! You have to think of a solution! There must be a solution, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux forced a laugh and shook his head. “Would I still be waiting here if I had a solution? We’re all in the same boat, and even though I am only left with part of my divine sense, I have recovered some memories with the aid of Yuhao’s spiritual power. I am also unwilling to die if I can live. However, this bomb created from the conversion of one extremity to another is not something I can control, and neither is it something you guys can change. I have no solutions anymore, and all I can do is wait for death to come.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both the Snow Lady and the Skydream Iceworm’s auras changed once Electrolux said those words. The Ice Empress was still trying her best to control the power flowing from her seal, but even she shuddered and nearly lost control of its vast strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry, Snow Empress,” the Ice Empress exclaimed. She could see that virtual light erupting with blinding brilliance, and ring after ring of azure-green that looked like flames rose from her body. The power leaking out from the seal was temporarily held back, and Huo Yuhao felt as if the snow pearl in his core was now spinning a little slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress was only left with her divine sense, and there was nothing she could do at this moment. She said fearfully, “Why are you doing this? Even if you ignite your own origin power, you can’t stop all of this. Fate has played us – we are destined to perish here together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This disaster had come too suddenly, and it was something that nobody was able to predict. At this moment, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea entered a deathly and despondent silence. The snow pearl in his core was expanding rapidly, and there was a possibility that it could explode at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were wide open, and he shouted inside the spiritual sea, “My fate belongs to me and not to the heavens! We cannot give up! Elder Yi, Snow Empress, Ice Empress, brother Skydream – I believe that nothing is impossible in this world, and we cannot give up if we have even a thread of a chance. We have simply too many things we have yet to do. There is only one motivation for your decisions to be with me, and that’s to live on! I beg all of you, in such a time of calamity, we cannot sit back and watch as disaster falls upon us. Even if the things we do may be futile, we have to try everything we can to fight for our lives! Come – release all your powers! Even if we die, we will die a spectacular and glorified death. I don’t believe our combined strengths will be unable to suppress the snow pearl!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s voice rekindled everyone’s spirits. The Skydream Iceworm was the first to agree with his speech, and said, “Yes, we can’t just keep waiting like this. Our fates are ours, and not determined by the heavens – we’ll fight to the end! Elder Yi, you’re at the highest level amongst us. I will release all of my spiritual origin for you to manipulate. If it’s possible, you can erase my consciousness to obtain more power. All I wish is that you can help Ice Empress survive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm’s fleshy body trembled violently, and his frame swelled explosively. He became like a giant vessel drifting on Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea, as the golden circles on his body radiated and expanded outwards. Immense spiritual fluctuations instantly quieted Huo Yuhao’s turbulent and torrential spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress was still burning her origin power, and she stared at the Skydream Iceworm with her crystal yellow eyes. “Skydream, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something that resembled a human appeared around the Skydream Iceworm’s eyes. He said gently, “Don’t say anything more, Ice Empress. The truth is that I have lived for more than a million years, but if there’s anything left in this world for me to love or to remember, it is you. When I was tortured by those brutes back in the Great Star Dou Forest all those years ago, I thought about dying together with them many times. With the strength of my spiritual origin, I was able to greatly reduce their cultivation even if I didn’t kill them. However, I didn’t want to die just like that – I was thinking about you, and you have always been inside my heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are not from the same race, and our races can even be said to be natural enemies. However, I was deeply enchanted by your beautiful body when I first met you. Perhaps it’s because I’m more intelligent than other Iceworms, but I’ve never forgotten about you ever since that day. And then, finally, we were together. Even if you may not accept me, to feel your aura every day was my life’s greatest fortune. Ever since I picked you up from the Extreme North with Yuhao, I have been very happy, much happier than I was in the past million years of my life – and the reason was because I had you beside me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can feel that you like the Snow Empress. Even though your genders are the same, your love has always been given to her. But I don’t care, because I’m happy enough that I get to feel your existence every single day. Inside Yuhao’s body, even if you may hate me, we can’t be separated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps this may be the last thing I can say to you, and maybe we won’t even succeed. However, I am even happier at this moment because I am able to offer you the last of my power and my consciousness. Ice Empress, please don’t scold me when I utter my last sentence if you can help it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I love you.”</span></p>
