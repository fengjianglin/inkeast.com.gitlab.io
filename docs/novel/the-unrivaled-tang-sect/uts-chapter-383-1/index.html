 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

The moment it entered its control mode, over a hundred cannons started to fire furiously. It was as if it did not require any soul power at all as it shot the soul cannons placed by the soul engineer legions to smithereens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It actually did not require any soul power. Specifically, it did not require any of Jing Ziyan’s soul power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This all-terrain self-driving fort was equipped with more than thirty Class 5 Milk Bottles. It could fight for hours without recharging, and Jing Ziyan now used it to its maximum potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the soul engineers whose positions were under fire were sent running in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the soul engineer legions of the Sun Moon Empire had a subordinate army. After all, soul engineers were more important and costlier. Someone had to do the dirty and tiring work, such as raising the outer defenses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was work for the subordinate army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the south of the city, there were more soul engineers in position, numbering around three hundred. There was a Class 8 soul engineer, two Class 7 soul engineers, and five Class 6 soul engineers. Coupled with the many other soul engineers who had taken up position there, their defenses were very tight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, at this moment, the Class 8 soul engineer had brought the two Class 7 soul engineers to reinforce the south of the city. There were no strong soul engineers left over there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The subordinate army, realizing that something was wrong, charged over. However, the many less powerful soul engineers fell into despair under the heavy bombardment from the all-terrain self-driving fort and the sharp sword qi of the Sword Fanatic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inky-black light only started to dissipate at this very moment. Xu Sanshi did not even need to maximize the power of his Xuanwu Domain. All he had to do was to ensure that its area of effect was maximized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything within a two hundred and fifty meter radius appeared to have turned into a swamp. Everyone, both soul engineers and the subordinate army, who rushed into this area immediately felt as if they had dived into a deep pool of mud. There was no way they could even see the location of the Sword Fanatic and the all-terrain self-driving fort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the strength of the Tang Sect and Shrek Academy! While soul engineers continually threatened the position of soul masters, truly powerful soul masters were highly intimidating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Xu Tianran, who had a high opinion of himself, had no choice but to collaborate with the Holy Ghost Church because of his fear of powerful soul masters! Shrek Academy was one such power he feared greatly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi and the other three could not sustain this onslaught for long. Once the soul engineer legions reacted properly, they would gather even more soul tools to take care of them. They would be in trouble then. However, by launching this sudden attack, what they wanted to do now was not to destroy the positions of the soul engineers, but to create as much chaos as possible. This would create enough opportunities for Huo Yuhao and the others to break out with the hostages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------------</span></p>

They had suffered greatly over the past few months, and they hated the evil soul masters with all their guts. The moment they could, they covered the entire area with long-range attacks launched at full power, killing more than half of the weaker evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Zhong brothers realized that the situation was turning bad for them, and they made their way to the exit while defending themselves. Their attackers were a few hundred soul masters! Even the weakest ones had at least four rings! Even if there were no powerful Titled Douluo, there were still many powerful Soul Sages and Soul Douluo, most of whom were teachers or powerful members of the various sects. Their numbers rivaled that of a soul engineer legion. In terms of individual fighting abilities, they surpassed the soul engineer legions! How could the brothers possibly beat them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao did not try to stop the Zhong brothers from leaving. The three of them were extremely powerful, and they specialized in controlling the souls of soul beasts to fight. They were all eight-ringed evil soul masters, and the moment they got over their shock, they would wreak horrific destruction. Ma Xiaotao could not delay the two evil Titled Douluo for long, either. After such a huge commotion, they would surely return shortly. Hence, the most important thing for them to do was rush out. They had to break through the seal of the soul engineers outside and reach somewhere spacious. Even a Titled Douluo would not dare to fight against more than a hundred soul masters at once!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, the most important thing right now was to break out as far as they could. Huo Yuhao knew what to do afterward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He activated his Spiritual Detection Sharing fully, and in the minds of every emotionally-charged person, the same voice resonated, “Calm yourselves. Follow me and break out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said that, Huo Yuhao turned around and looked toward the south of the city, which had been completely flattened. His body started to shine with an eye-catching jade-green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next instant, a thick jade-green pillar of light pierced through the sky and bombarded the area over there. An intense explosion sounded, and flakes of ice flew in all directions. A huge hole had appeared in the wall. Huo Yuhao’s soul thruster shone with light once more as he quickly arrived in front of the hole. As the hostages watched, dark-golden claws almost ten meters long appeared suddenly and silently. The broken hole became five times larger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone, either a powerful member of a random sect or a teacher, gasped and said, “The Darkgolden Terrorclaw?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go, now!” Huo Yuhao cried out. This time, his voice was filled with spiritual undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While many of these hostages’ soul power had recovered, and they had also been soaked in a reinvigorating medicine, they had also been imprisoned in the water prison for a few months. Their strength was far from optimal. Hence, they could not wait until their bodies showed signs of fatigue. There could be no delay in their breakout.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Zhong brothers, Huo Yuhao believed that they would not dare re-enter for the moment. There were a few hundred soul masters here! No matter who was guarding them, surely their first response right now was to get help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, who was at the front, rushed out first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moat outside was now riddled with explosions. Right now, the water from the moat was flowing outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s soul thruster fired down to ensure that he could remain suspended in mid-air. As his hands touched the water, one could clearly see that they were enveloped in diamond-like ice crystals. This was his Ice Empress’ Pincer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold gas started to spread and turned into two rays of emerald-green light. First, they struck the surging water, which slowed, and then stopped. Then, under the terrifying chill of his Ultimate Ice, Huo Yuhao froze the moat solid. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he pulled his hands apart, he cast his gaze afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul engineers had been thrown into complete disarray. At this moment, a team of around fifty soul engineers was rushing toward them. When they saw Huo Yuhao, a ball of blinding red light flew toward him like a shooting star in the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile crept across Huo Yuhao’s face. He had expected this. The fifty soul engineers stationed outside the southern gate were caught between a rock and a hard place. They had realized that something was amiss at their flank, but they had no choice but to push forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he watched the high-explosive bomb hurtling toward him, Huo Yuhao did not try to dodge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of golden light shone from his body and his eyes turned completely golden. In his eyes, he was analyzing the path of this high-explosive bomb. With his terrifying spiritual power, his ability to analyze any single object was intimidating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his right hand, and diamond-like ice crystals shone brightly on his hand. Then, he reached out to grab the incoming high-explosive bomb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poof!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A curious scene appeared. The moment Huo Yuhao’s right hand grabbed the high-explosive bomb, the explosion the soul engineers were expecting did not materialize. Instead, the red light surrounding the high-explosive bomb faded. Its impact, however, made Huo Yuhao waver slightly in mid-air. Following that, the high-explosive bomb was completely destroyed in Huo Yuhao’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A high-explosive bomb’s power came from an intense compression of fire-type soul power. With the formation array of a Class 6 soul tool, its soul power was further destabilized before it was fired. Once it hit its target or met any resistance, it would disrupt and cause a massive explosion.</span></p>
