 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was silent, and didn’t say anything at all. In his heart, he was even a little in awe of the Star Luo Empire’s Emperor. He was very clear. He was right. Given the current circumstances, even Elder Xuan couldn’t do anything, even though he was an Ultimate Douluo. The city’s fate was sealed, and couldn’t be reversed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Hao was a hero, but he was born in the wrong time. He couldn’t fully unleash his abilities as a commander, as he was suppressed by soul tool technology. He could only watch as the Sun Moon Empire suppressed the Star Luo Empire through their absolute advantage in terms of soul tool technology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Tang Sect and Xuan Ziwen were in Shrek City, Xuan Ziwen was only one man! How could he challenge an entire empire and its thousands of years of history? He had also grown much older over the past few years. Even though he was already a Titled Douluo, he was simply drained too much everyday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect’s soul tool technology had been growing. It was already close to mainstream soul tool technology. However, whether it was in terms of resources, production ability, scale or research capabilities, it was still inferior to the Sun Moon Empire. These were irreversible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Should I really let the Sun Moon Empire rule the continent?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan shut his eyes painfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Sun Moon Empire didn’t attack Shrek City eventually, there still seemed to be a huge rock on Elder Xuan’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, I’ll leave first. I’ll serve you in my next life.” One official turned around and left. Tears were streaming down his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One person was fine. However, there couldn’t just be one official standing here! If they didn’t think for themselves, they still had to think for their families.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the first came the second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a little while, more than half the court was already gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Jiawei laughed mockingly and slowly came in front of Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan!” He bent down and bowed to Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan raised his hands and lifted him up with gentle soul power. At the same time, Xu Jiawei also stood up. It wasn’t just his respect for an Emperor. It was his respect for an Emperor who treasured life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Jiawei sighed and said, “I represent the Star Luo Empire. Thank you, Shrek Academy. Thank you, Tang Sect. Without both of you, the Star Luo Empire would have been destroyed. Thanks. However, things have finally come to an end. Elder Xuan, you and the others from the academy and the sect should leave too. After all, the academy is independent. It doesn’t belong to any empire. You’ve already gone to such lengths for the Star Luo Empire. We are grateful for that. But you can’t continue. It might enrage the Sun Moon Empire. The Star Luo Empire can die, but Shrek Academy can’t. Shrek is where the true legacy of the Douluo empires lie.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan furrowed his brow and sighed heavily. He knew Xu Jiawei was right. Just like the officials who had left, Elder Xuan could ignore his own plight, but he was still the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion. He had to think for the million people in Shrek City! Moreover, there were still troops from the Dou Ling Empire in Shrek City. The remaining royal family members of the Dou Ling Empire were all in Shrek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, even though Shrek isn’t capable of protecting the Star Luo Empire, we can still lead the royal family back to Shrek if you are willing to do so. You can find an opportunity to rise again in the future. How about that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Jiawei laughed and shook his head. He replied, “No. The Sun Moon Empire has occupied too much land. Shrek City is only a city. If the empire wants to exert pressure, it doesn’t even need to attack. It just has to cut off all supply routes, so that Shrek City becomes helpless. Elder Xuan, let me give you a word of advice. After you return, ask the Dou Ling and Heavenly Soul Empire’s royal families to dismiss their troops. In that way, Shrek can still survive. Otherwise, even Shrek City can’t protect them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, Xu Jiawei suddenly kneeled down in front of Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, what are you doing?” Elder Xuan gave way and was astonished as he looked at the Emperor. From his earlier words, Elder Xuan could tell that he was superior to the Emperors of both the Heavenly Soul and Dou Ling Empires. This was probably also why the Star Luo Empire was the last to be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan, I have a request.” Xu Jiawei could no longer call himself the Emperor now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he said this, not only was his expression serious, but it was also filled with an indescribable sense of persistence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, please tell me.” Elder Xuan replied respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Jiawei said, “After the Sun Moon Empire conquers the continent and changes it to the Sun Moon Continent, I hope that you plant a seed of revenge for the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. In the future, our future generations will change the name back one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he said this, everyone’s expressions changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name of the Douluo Continent had already been around for thousands of years. Was it really going to change now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The few officials that had walked out of the hall stopped in their tracks. They unwittingly clenched their fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s body shook. His eyes brightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the Sun Moon Empire really changes the name of the continent, I swear that I’ll make sure the Sun Moon Empire’s royal lineage will never carry on. This is even if it catalyzes widespread chaos!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name of the Douluo Continent had been around for thousands of years. It carried the desire of every soul master too. How could it be tarnished just like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An empire could fall, but the name of the continent must never change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the crowd in the hall were all very agitated. They all kneeled down in front of Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a majestic voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Message from the War God Empress – hand over the White Tiger Duke in three days. The Star Luo Empire can surrender, and deaths can be avoided. No looting will occur, no invasion will be carried out, and everything will remain as it is in Star Luo City. Otherwise, I’ll wreak havoc!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she mentioned the words ‘wreak havoc”, huge soundwaves shook the entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The city could surrender only if the White Tiger Duke was surrendered?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why was this the condition? Even though the White Tiger Duke had been fighting the Sun Moon Empire these past few years, did they really have to fear him considering the absolute advantage they possessed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Report—"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A messenger ran in from the outside. “Your Majesty, Star Luo City has been surrounded, and the northern and southern city gates have been sealed. The officials and their families who planned to defect to the Sun Moon Empire, as well as civilians, were all chased back into the city. No surrender is allowed. No one is allowed to leave the city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard these words, everyone around was horrified. Surrendering wasn’t even an option?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke gritted his teeth until they almost broke. He clenched his fists tightly. “Bastard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Jiawei’s facial muscles were also contorting. No matter what, he hadn’t expected to be in such a state; he couldn’t even surrender.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soundwaves were heard once again, just like before. Through the sound amplifiers carried by surveillance soul tools, all of Star Luo City could hear this voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty!” The White Tiger Duke kneeled on one knee. “Please allow me to fight them myself. I won’t surrender, but I’m willing to fight until I die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nonsense!” Xu Jiawei shouted at the top of his voice. “You are a loyal official of this court. Without you, this empire will cease to exist. I can hand myself over, but I won’t hand you over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps we aren’t doomed yet.” At this moment, a slightly low-pitched and hoarse voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Xu Jiawei subconsciously turned back. Someone walked out from the crowd behind Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he walked out, both Xu Jiawei and the White Tiger Duke were stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They wouldn’t be very bothered if it was someone else who said those words earlier. However, because it came from this person, it felt as if they had a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hallmaster Xuan, what good idea do you have?” Xu Jiawei asked anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, the person who had walked out from the crowd was the Hallmaster of the Tang Sect’s Soul Tool Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen looked much more elderly than before. He had been tirelessly researching over the past few years, but he was rarely involved with soul tool production now, especially over the past year or so. He was researching almost day in and day out. He only left his laboratory after the Star Luo Empire came under serious threat. He also brought the elites from the Soul Tool Hall out with him. However, he didn’t cease his research. But no one knew what he had been researching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was abnormally red. However, there was an excited look in his eyes. He said, “Let those who have left leave. It’s best to let go of the officials who can’t weather the storm with you. Your Majesty, my research has succeeded. The Sun Moon Empire won’t be able to take advantage so easily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The White Tiger Duke immediately stood up. His eyes brightened. There was a look of desire as he stared at Xuan Ziwen. He knew that this was perhaps the last hope for the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Moon Empire base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was wearing fiery-red armor, and standing silently in front of the commander’s tent. She was looking at the Star Luo City’s walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three years had passed. Time didn’t have any effect on her. She was still as beautiful as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last ultimatum has been issued. I’m only waiting for their reply now. From the current situation in the Star Luo Empire, they have no choice. The White Tiger Duke will most certainly surrender, given how loyal he is. In this way, I can kill fewer people when the city surrenders. In that case…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she thought until here, Ju Zi’s body shuddered. An indescribable fear spread in her heart. She couldn’t help but sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s been three years. He has indeed not returned. However, I still feel very terrified when I think of him as I take down cities.</span></p>
