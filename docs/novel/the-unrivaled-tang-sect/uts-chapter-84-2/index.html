 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 84.2: The Gold of Life</strong></p>
 <p>“Yuhao, this carving knife made from the Gold of Life isn’t simple at all. Once you get it, I’ll be able to resolve its issues, whereupon you’ll be able to easily solve some of the problems you’ll have to face in the future with it. I won’t have to worry about my strand of divine sense being extinguished either.”</p>
 <p>Electrolux sank back into silence after uttering these words. However, only Huo Yuhao was able to listen to him speak; even the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress were screened out by his mysterious powers.</p>
 <p>Shrek Academy had obtained a plentiful harvest from tonight’s auction, but they had spent a lot of money to acquire it. Wang Yan decided to settle the issue of payment and the collection of the items by himself, allowing the others to go back and rest. As for the Soul-Devouring Carving Knife that Huo Yuhao had bought, Wang Yan would be able to retrieve it with Huo Yuhao’s participant sign.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan’s ranking within the Starlight Auction had increased from the initial white to purple with this exchange. Subsequently, he now had the qualifications to participate in auctions that were of a higher class. However, only black-ranked and above customers were allowed to participate in the Starlight Auction’s top-ranked auctions.</p>
 <p>The Soul-Devouring Carving Knife had left a very deep impression on Huo Yuhao. This was especially so after Electrolux’s words, which made him overjoyed. His senses as a spiritual-type soul master were extremely acute. Although his spiritual power was far, far weaker than pinnacle experts like Electrolux, the Skydream Iceworm, and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, he had a very strong ability to differentiate between good and evil. He could sense pure goodwill from Electrolux’s divine sense, but the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress still had some reservations towards him. However, these reservations began to gradually decrease as they followed his improvements in cultivation. After all, they no longer had any path of retreat.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t head straight back to his room after returning to the Imperial Grand Star Hotel. Instead, he went to Wang Dong’s room and knocked on his door.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?” Wang Dong’s voice rang out from within.</p>
 <p>“It’s me, I’m back.”</p>
 <p>The door opened, revealing a somewhat stupefied Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao wasn’t polite at all as he entered Wang Dong’s room before closing the room’s door. He asked, concerned, “Wang Dong, what’s with you?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong shook his head and furrowed his brows slightly, “You might not believe me, and even I don’t understand what’s going on. When I heard everyone talking about using soul tools, I felt an indescribable sense of vexation in my heart. There seems to be another consciousness in my mind that’s rejecting the use of soul tools. This feeling’s kinda strange, but it’s not comfortable at all. However, I don’t seem to be able to reject it. I chose to come back because of that. Actually, I understand what Teacher Wang Yan’s saying, and I believe that what he’s saying is correct. However, it seems like I can’t use soul tools at all.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was stunned. “Just what is this? Is there a problem with your spiritual sea?” He immediately thought back to his own situation. Did Wang Dong have other souls living within his spiritual sea? He still remembered what the Skydream Iceworm had told him--Wang Dong also had three martial souls, like him. His three martial souls were already settled now. His Spirit Eyes were his main martial soul without a doubt, while his second martial soul was the powerful Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. His third martial soul was very likely to be one that he couldn’t add any soul rings to--the Divine Law of Necromancy, the Calamity Necromancer Electrolux who seemingly possessed the powers of a evil soul master despite being much more pure-hearted than many other people.</p>
 <p>However, what about Wang Dong? What were his three martial souls? Huo Yuhao believed that the Skydream Iceworm’s judgement couldn’t have been incorrect.</p>
 <p>“Wang Dong, do you trust me?” Huo Yuhao asked seriously, his hands on Wang Dong’s shoulders.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was stunned for a moment. He immediately nodded subconsciously, “Naturally. Why wouldn’t I trust you?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said in a low voice, “You know that I’m a spiritual-type soul master. The biggest difference we spiritual-type soul masters have from ordinary soul masters lies in how well we can control our spiritual power. I have much more spiritual power than ordinary soul masters, and my spiritual power is stored in an area called my spiritual sea. I feel like I know something similar to what you’ve just told me, so I’d like to check your spiritual sea for a bit. Is that okay? There will be no problems as long as you have complete trust in me. At the very least, we’ll be able to figure out whether there’s a problem with your spiritual sea.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong looked deeply into Huo Yuhao’s eyes, “I trust you. But, what do we do if there really is a problem with my spiritual sea?”</p>
 <p>“Then we’ll solve that problem.” Huo Yuhao replied unhesitatingly. He had no confidence in other areas, but he was certain of his abilities with regards to spiritual power. After all, he had the support of an existence like the Skydream Iceworm! There was an extremely miniscule chance of a problem arising with the assistance of his Brother Skydream, who had a million years’ worth of experience in controlling spiritual power. Moreover, he even had a power like the Ice Empress supervising him.</p>
 <p>Seeing Huo Yuhao’s confidence, Wang Dong nodded. “Okay. What do I have to do?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “You have to close your eyes and stop moving. No matter what happens, no matter what you feel, don’t be astonished. Do your best to calm your mind. I’m going to carefully peer into your spiritual sea with my spiritual power.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Wang Dong nodded, “Do we start now?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded back, “We’ll start now. Prepare yourself.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong slowly shut his eyes and relaxed his body. He and Huo Yuhao were close partners who were able to fuse their martial souls. As a result, they had already established an unbreakable level of trust.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao took a deep breath and calmed himself as much as possible. At this moment, the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress were both awake. They were monitoring Huo Yuhao’s control of his spiritual power at his request, and they would make a move if any problems were to arise.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao moved his hands from Wang Dong’s shoulders to the back of his head, then lowered his head slowly. After that, he placed his forehead against Wang Dong’s forehead. The two of them could even hear each other’s breathing.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s body shivered slightly. His long eyelashes shook, brushing against Huo Yuhao’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Don’t move, relax. I’m about to start.” Huo Yuhao urged quietly.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong regained his composure, but his face was somewhat red.</p>
 <p>A gentle wave of spiritual power carefully flowed out from Huo Yuhao’s forehead and into Wang Dong’s body from the point at which their foreheads were touching.</p>
 <p>Soul masters considered the area between the eyes, the brows, the forehead, and the nose the spiritual root of Heaven and Earth. It was the place which contained the spirit, the ancestral cavity, and the ancestral Qi. At the same time, it was where the spiritual sea resided. Placing their spiritual seas next to each other was naturally the easiest way in which Huo Yuhao was able to easily transfer his spiritual power to Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>Their soul power was already harmonious due to their martial soul fusion. Moreover, Wang Dong trusted him fully. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was able to quietly enter Wang Dong’s spiritual sea without any trouble.</p>
