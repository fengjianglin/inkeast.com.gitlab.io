Even Elder Xuan trailed him for a while, he discovered that Huo Yuhao had sealed up emotionally and immersed himself in this crazy cultivation state. However, it was undeniable the progress Huo Yuhao was making in this time. He was calm and cold, treating his body like a soul tool, trying to sculpt and cultivating tirelessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Practically, all his teachers advised him to rest, but he didn’t listen. He wanted to cultivate every moment without rest, and no-one could dissuade him from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……&nbsp;</span></p>

Following this, Huo Yuhao put the away the soul tools on his person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Success! This was the first Class 6 soul tool that he had successfully created. Although he needed to use the Eye of Destiny to increase his spiritual power to be able to control the soul tool when he used it, he had still succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao.” Elder Xuan’s voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped unwittingly and turned around. He was a little stunned as he looked at Elder Xuan. He said respectfully, “Elder Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said deeply, “Follow me to the Sea God’s Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was puzzled, and said, “But I still need to cultivate. There are still twelve segments that I haven’t completed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was furious. “This is an order. Do you think you can fulfill Elder Mu’s wish by being like this? Three months. You’ve gone mad for three months. If this continues, your body and mind will collapse, but you still won’t fulfill Elder Mu’s wish. Do you want me to watch you die? Furthermore, there’s something more important for you to do now, so you can’t cultivate like that anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s body jerked slightly, and he turned before walking away. He muttered, “I want to cultivate, I want to cultivate.” As he spoke, his pace quickened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A lamentable look flashed across Elder Xuan’s eyes. What an emotional kid! While on the surface he was reprimanding Huo Yuhao, underneath how could he not feel heartache? He was proud on Elder Mu’s behalf and envious of him for having such a great disciple too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan’s figure flashed, and he reached behind Huo Yuhao before pulling him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan completely overwhelmed Huo Yuhao, but Huo Yuhao also reacted instantly. His leg slid forward, an intense white light shone from his body, covering it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used his left toes as an axis and spun around like a gyroscope. The Darkgolden Terrorclaws turned into five meters long claw projections that grabbed towards Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Battling seemed to have become instinctual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Darkgolden Terrorclaws had become stronger over the past year. Almost becoming real from their tangible state. With them was a layer of diamond ice crystals, which meant that Huo Yuhao had combined his Darkgolden Terrorclaws and the Ice Empress’ Pincer. It’s important to note that the two are completely different soul skills, one came from a soul ring, the other from a soul bone. One was of Ultimate Ice element, the other metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just adding the strength of the Ice Empress’ Pincer to the Darkgolden Terrorclaws wasn’t hard, instead, their strengths had been completely fused. Leading to a complete transformation, all of this happened under Elder Xuan’s guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Yuhao was in no rush to become a four-ringed Soul Ancestor, he still couldn’t be defeated by any of the Shrek’s Seven Monsters. Even Bei Bei’s Radiant Holy Dragon or Xu Sanshi’s Awakening of the Xuanwu Turtle could only repress him at best. However, this was under the assumption Huo Yuhao wasn’t using any soul tools. Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi were both Soul Kings, able to fight lower level Soul Emperors with some difficulty. After the experiment earlier, Huo Yuhao could be considered almost a Class 6 soul engineer, equivalent to a soul emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once Huo Yuhao obtained his fourth soul ring, his powers would be on par with Bei Bei’s and Xu Sanshi’s at least. In reality, he would be slightly better than anyone else in the Shrek’s Seven Monsters, even comparing him to Wang Dong. His mastery in the martial department and soul tool department was slowly revealing its advantages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan groaned as he faced the Darkgolden Terrorclaws. He moved his shoulder slightly, and a layer of yellow light spread from his body. When that layer of yellow light appeared, it was contorted tremendously, making Elder Xuan’s body illusory in appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Terrorclaws caused a piercing sound to echo out as they struck the yellow light. Huo Yuhao finally reacted to what he was doing, and hurriedly stopped his actions. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s projection disappeared instantly but Elder Xuan extended his right hand and chopped down on Huo Yuhao’s neck. Even through the Ice Empress’ Armor Elder Xuan, still forced Huo Yuhao to collapse in one strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan grabbed with his right hand and pulled him over. After that, he threw Huo Yuhao over his shoulder. He sighed and mumbled, “This brat needs to rest. It’s been tough on him over the past three months.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a short while, Elder Xuan brought Huo Yuhao to the Sea God’s Pavilion. Although Elder Xuan had already succeeded the role of Hallmaster of the Sea God’s Pavilion, he didn’t move into Elder Mu’s former room, choosing to remain in his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two people in his room at the moment—Fan Yu and He Caitou. He Caitou was in far better shape now, and his muscles were like a replica of Qian Duoduo’s. His tanned skin gave a healthy glow, and while he still looked as goofy as ever, his disposition was much more mature than a year prior, developing a pensive look. Much like Huo Yuhao, he had also put in a lot of hard work over the last year. He had also slowly found his path, the path that would end up giving him the title of the Origin of Destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan placed Huo Yuhao on his bed, giving him some medicine to calm his mind. Fan Yu asked respectfully, “Elder Xuan, how’s Yuhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan replied, “He’s too tensed up. Elder Mu’s death was a huge blow to him. However, I believe that he can overcome this. The last three months he’s been numbing himself with cultivation. We’ll let him rest. You should prepare to leave in three days, Shaozhe will personally escort you to Heavenly Soul&nbsp;Empire’s Maple Leaf City to make the exchange with the students of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. Fan Yu, we leave this great responsibility to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu asked, “Elder Xuan, are we really not going to increase Yuhao’s soul rings?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan laughed and said, “Let him keep a low profile, we’re in no hurry to make him a soul ancestor right now. Let them underestimate him so he can learn stuff easier. The important thing for our students is to see more, learn more, say less and do less. Remember that. Whether or not we can get our hands on their core knowledge is on all of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu nodded and replied, “I understand. If we meet with a suitable soul beast for him in the next three years, I will consider letting him add a soul ring. Otherwise, we’ll try to keep it on the down-low to keep the Sun Moon Academy in the dark.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “The Illustrious Virtue Hall is just like us. To obtain our core knowledge they’ve opened their Illustrious Virtue Hall to us, and we the inner courtyard to them. While they may not try to limit you in what you can learn, they could attempt to impart advanced knowledge beyond your comprehension. Even if you don’t fully understand what they give you, be sure to fully record it for later. They’ll be wary of you, ensuring Caitou and Yuhao’s protection is your highest priority.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan looked at Huo Yuhao, who was lying on the bed and said, “Elder Mu’s death has changed the mind of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. We’ll exchange our students at Maple Leaf City, and they will return in three years, just before the next Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. The venue for which will also be held in Maple Leaf City this time. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy is being very sincere since they’re anxious to break through in the soul masters area. Likewise, we’re very anxious to have a Class 10 soul engineer. Both academies will send out ten students, from the Sun Moon side both Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen will be coming, and then on our side, Elder Mu agreed to send Yuhao as one of the ten. For the other eight students, besides Yuhao and Caitou we must pick them with care. Caitou, you must try to shine in the Illustrious Virtue Hall and be the center of their attention, do you understand what I mean? ”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou nodded without any hesitation. “Elder Xuan, I understand. The other eight students are there to protect me and Huo Yuhao, while I’m there as a second layer of protection for Yuhao. If he wants to keep a low profile, then I must keep a high one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan nodded satisfactorily and said, “Okay. Go and prepare first. I will return a sane Huo Yuhao to you in three days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Fan Yu answered, but he was still a little worried as he looked at Huo Yuhao. Could he recover in three days? He was more than aware of just how hard Huo Yuhao had been working the past three months, he was internally broken. Elder Mu’s death had just been a great blow to him.</span></p>
