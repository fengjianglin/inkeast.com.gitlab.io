 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Lady danced in the icy skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was a unique being. She was a living being formed by the purest ice-type origin energy of heaven and earth within the Extreme North’s core region, and after countless years of gestation and growth, had finally developed her own thoughts and intelligence. She finally became an intelligent creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her original form was composed of the purest elements. If the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence was a treasure, then she was the Extreme North’s daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Icesky Snow Lady, blessed and unique; the Snow Empress, dancing as snowflakes drifted in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could clearly feel that he was slowly experiencing moments of enlightenment from this incredibly beautiful dance. But even he wasn’t clear what he was being enlightened about. Perhaps this was just one of his most peculiar experiences...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress stood beside Huo Yuhao, her eyes completely intoxicated. She was also immersed in the Snow Empress’ dance. The Snow Empress had always been a fairy of the snow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress’ dance continued for an hour or so before she finally descended from the sky and returned to Huo Yuhao’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her expression seemed very calm, and not as intoxicated as the Ice Empress was, but Huo Yuhao could tell from her emotions that she was feeling very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! They are home, and they should be happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt a large mass of life energy emerge from beyond the horizon. This wave traveled in their direction very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao unleashed Spiritual Detection and directed it into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is…” Huo Yuhao’s pupils instantly contracted, and fear appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Extreme North’s core region was still a world of ice and snow that stretched to the end of the horizon, and not a single trace of life could be seen. However, Huo Yuhao could see within the range of his Spiritual Detection that there were thousands and thousands of soul beasts gathering in his direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul beasts took many different forms. Tthere were flying soul beasts that were rarely seen in the Extreme North, while more of them were on the ground. The Extreme Northern Bears that Huo Yuhao had seen before were here, and there were many other species that he had never seen before. Every soul beast seemed very excited, and they were running in his direction as quickly as they could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was but the second time that Huo Yuhao had seen such a spectacular gathering of soul beasts. The last time this had happened was when the Great Star Dou Forest had launched a beast wave against Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t as many soul beasts as there were compared to back then, but this was almost a miracle, considering that the Extreme North’s core region was almost uninhabited!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly calmed down after a very momentary shock.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps only the Snow Empress can create a scene as spectacular as this in the Extreme North. Even the Ice Empress isn’t as good as she is in this respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was number three in the Ten Great Savage Beasts, and was the Extreme North’s true dictator. She was a formidable soul beast with seven hundred thousand years of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of the Ten Great Savage Beasts, only the top three controlled a particular region. The Beast God, Di Tian, controlled the core of the continent, the Great Star Dou Forest. The Evileye Tyrant King ruled over the Evildemon Forest, with the most soul beasts within the Sun Moon Empire. However, the Snow Empress’ reach was the widest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the icy plains of the Extreme North that stretched to the end of the world, every single soul beast bowed to her command. She was queen in this place, and also the dictator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God or the Evileye Tyrant King had never come to this place to challenge the Snow Empress’ authority. Not even the Beast God was confident of defeating the Snow Empress in an environment like the Extreme North. Furthermore, no other place inhabited by soul beasts was as cohesive as the Extreme North.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had merged with the Snow Empress by chance and coincidence back then, and she became his spirit. The Snow Empress almost blew apart his body because she had too much power on her own, and the Calamity Necromancer Electrolux had to burn the remnants of his divine sense so that Huo Yuhao could complete the equality pact in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress became the Snow Lady afterwards. In the beginning, she was like Huo Yuhao’s daughter, and her cute demeanor made everyone express tender affection for her. The Snow Lady gradually grew up, but she was always by Huo Yuhao’s side, always helping him, accompanying him, and supporting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Huo Yuhao’s heart, the Snow Lady had already become family. Her status in his heart could almost compare to Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Snow Empress had recovered her memory not too long ago due to the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence. Huo Yuhao felt bewildered and helpless; he wasn’t afraid of anything except that the Snow Empress would leave him. The Snow Lady had become the Snow Empress, and he could feel that they were less intimate, and there was more reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That reverence in his heart had reached the highest possible level at this moment. He finally understood that the little Snow Lady that had once treated him like a father was the dictator of the Extreme North, and she ruled over thousands and thousands of soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress… she’s the Snow Empress, after all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint sadness gradually appeared at the bottom of Huo Yuhao’s eyes, and he subconsciously took a step back. His expression was very calm, but there was a dash of sorrow deep in his heart. If it were possible, he truly hoped that the Snow Empress was still the Snow Lady; he even hoped that she would remain the tiny Snow Lady that had formed a pact with him in the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress just stood there silently and gazed into the distance as the corner of her mouth curved into a gorgeous smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immense pack of soul beasts came ever closer. The Ice Empress’ eyes also grew excited; yes, they were back, and they were back in the world where they reigned supreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thousands of soul beasts thundering across the Extreme North’s icy plains… what a rare sight! The enormous beast wave was congregating in Huo Yuhao’s direction very quickly, and they stopped only when they arrived a thousand meters away from the Snow Empress and the Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the soul beasts in the Extreme North slowly lay prostrate on the ground after they reached this place, facing the Snow Empress and the Ice Empress with the most respectful and worshipful attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul beasts in the distance gradually formed a circle that was two thousand meters in diameter. This circle’s thickness gradually increased as the number of soul beasts grew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the Extreme North’s soul beasts were white. If one didn’t look closely, one would think that they were just snow piled up on tiny hills. Some soul beasts that were relatively larger in size were particularly eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress stood there quietly as the expression on her beautiful face grew cold. She was just standing there, proud and aloof, and there was no other soul beast that dared to stand as proudly as she did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were in awe; they were worshipping their ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress had been gone for far too long. But even so, nobody in the Extreme North dared to forget her aura. She was the one who protected their paradise, and her existence made every soul beast in the Extreme North bow to her command. Not a single powerful soul beast dared to resist her rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Extreme North had had very few conflicts ever since the Snow Empress took over as ruler. Nobody dared to challenge or violate her authority. Every single soul beast knew that the Snow Empress was the Icesky Snow Lady, the spirit of the snow. She could sense everything where there was snow and ice. In the beginning, they were afraid of the Snow Empress, but this fear slowly became reverence. The most ferocious and dominant soul beasts in the Extreme North eventually lost their lives to the Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were no longer any voices of resistance. The only person who could decide everything and dictate everything was the Icesky Snow Lady’s ice-cold voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More and more soul beasts gathered at the outer layer. However, the icy plains were still extremely quiet, and one had to listen very closely to hear the soul beasts’ breathing. They were panting with excitement; for many of these soul beasts, to be able to see the Snow Empress in person was their life’s greatest honor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bears from before had also returned. However, they were just lying prostrate on the outer layer; they weren’t even worthy of entering the inner circle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an exceptionally large bear that had returned with them. This bear’s tremendous body was like a tiny hill as it walked over, and even though it was travelling on all fours, it was still more than fifteen meters tall. Thick fur covered its immense frame, radiating faint silver hues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this enormous bear appeared, the soul beasts that were prostrate on the ground swiftly opened a path so that it could pass. It walked to the innermost circle and faced the Snow Empress before it prostrated itself as well. Its action was just like the tiny bear that Huo Yuhao had seen before; its giant buttocks were raised high into the air, and its upper body was flat on the ground. Its large head swayed faintly as it whimpered softly at the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That sound made it seem like the bear had just met its owner, filled with admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled faintly when she saw the bear, and she waved at him gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul beasts prostrate on the Extreme North immediately stared at the ice bear, their eyes filled with envy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gigantic bear was overjoyed as it stood up and howled elatedly into the air before it ran towards the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bear was far too big, and its running was like a tiny mountain jumping up and down in the icy plains of the Extreme North. Its incredibly fat body would leave deep marks in ground every time it landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One thousand meters was but a blink of an eye for this bear. It suddenly slowed down only when it was fifty meters away from the Snow Empress, and it actually crawled the last fifty meters until it was right in front of her. Its head was over two meters in diameter, but it still shoved its face down before the Snow Empress. His large nose, which was different from its white fur, a little pinkish, poked forward. Huo Yuhao felt as if this fellow’s breathing could almost create hurricanes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t need to use Spiritual Detection to clearly judge that this bear was a hundred-thousand-year soul beast. Even though its strength couldn’t compare to the Great Star Dou Forest’s Bear Lord, Huo Yuhao figured that this bear couldn’t be that much weaker. However, it was extremely respectful towards the Snow Empress, much more respectful than the Bear Lord was toward the Beast God.</span></p>
