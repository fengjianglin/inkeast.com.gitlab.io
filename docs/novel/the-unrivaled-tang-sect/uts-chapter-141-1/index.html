Her swollen right arm started going back to normal again as well. While she was in such miserable pain that she couldn’t speak, she was able to hear the conversation between Elder Xuan and Huo Yuhao. Xiao Xiao wasn’t simply grateful when she saw the resolute look on Huo Yuhao’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s power wasn’t under the fire element, instead it was of the metal element. It was a tyrannical power that demonstrated the sharpness of the metal element to the point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could even hear the sonorous sound when the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s strength clashed with the Ice Empress’ Pincer’s power..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, all of the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s strength had been siphoned to Huo Yuhao’s right palm. At which point Xiao Xiao groaned slightly before collapsing in Elder Xuan’s arms, unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was unable to stop Huo Yuhao before, but he knew what to do now and reacted with haste—receiving Xiao Xiao from Elder Xuan so that he could help Huo Yuhao without complication.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan stood over Huo Yuhao, watching him anxiously. He was well aware of what was going on, thus he couldn’t act recklessly here. As long as Huo Yuhao could suppress that soul bone’s power in his palm, then he must allow him to absorb it. Elder Xuan wasn’t nervous because of how precious the soul bone was—it was because he wanted to preserve Huo Yuhao’s right arm!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The drained Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s energy had all entered Huo Yuhao’s right palm. Huo Yuhao could sense that the Mysterious Jade Hands and his Ice Empress’ Pincer were being a little overwhelmed by the invading energies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his soul skill active he couldn’t absorb the soul bone. However, if he withdrew the Ice Empress’ Pincer he would have to bear with the intense pain relying on sheer willpower and his body’s tough physique.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought about it. Huo Yuhao wanted to laugh. He wondered if soul bones were his arch-nemesis. Whether it was the Ice Jade Empress’ Torso Bone, the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone, or the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s Right Palm Bone he was absorbing right now, they all gave him immense difficulties when trying to fuse with them. While the current situation isn’t nearly as potentially fatal or painful as Ice Jade Empress’ Torso bone had been, it would still be painful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s choice was to face this ordeal bravely. However, one cannot simply always face their obstacles head-on, even if they’re willing to. If one didn’t collapse amidst the repression, they would be burnt amidst the suppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took in a slow, deep breath, and the Mysterious Jade Hand’s made one more full body circulation of soul power. Huo Yuhao slowly closed his eyes, and in the next instant—the bright radiance disappeared. Leaving behind an intense dark gold glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong lifted a hand to cover his mouth in, stopping himself from shouting in surprise. Elder Xuan’s body twitched. Aside from the unconcealed shock in his eyes there was a faint hint of awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Resilient and courageous! Only Huo Yuhao could make such a critical decision!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The excruciating pain led Huo Yuhao to believe that the Darkgolden Terrorclaw had torn his palm bone asunder! The maniacal will of the Darkgolden Terrorclaw started rising up, prepared to rush into the rest of his arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that happened he would end up just like Xiao Xiao had, as the Darkgolden Terroclaw’s strength would run rampant in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao made the correct decision; disregarding the pain in his right palm with his resilient will, as if his right palm didn’t belong to him. His immense spiritual power attacked the maniacal will. Simultaneously, his forehead lit up with a blinding turquoise light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes shot wide open, an intense aura of light exuding from them. His third eye also started to crack open, and a streak of azure-green light flashed from his eyes as a bolt of electricity came out of the Life Gold before piercing his right wrist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The azure-green light spread, and the aura within helped to seal the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s power within the confines of his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was shocked. He could distinguish that the azure-green light was a carving knife, but what was this third eye doing on Huo Yuhao?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there was only one possibility that he thought of—the second awakening of one’s Body Soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The azure-green light didn’t just appear on his right hand. Huo Yuhao’s Life Gold slowly displayed its strength, releasing an aura of light all over his body. This aura’s appearance left both Wang Dong and Elder Xuan relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Huo Yuhao’s second trump card. Although offering to save Xiao Xiao was a little reckless, he was still very confident in his own body. The Ice Empress’ Pincer actively prevented the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s power from running rampant. Then he used the Life Guardian’s blade and life power to suppress the power further. While this move also increased his body’s overall resistance. With all these actions being put into play, Huo Yuhao could only resign himself to defeat if he still couldn’t absorb this Darkgolden Terrorclaw Right Palm Bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Life Gold’s power was proven once again. That bountiful life force seemed to sense the mayhem in his hand and advanced towards it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long ago, The Calamity Necromancer Electrolux, spoke to Huo Yuhao of the Life Gold’s greatness. As of right now, Huo Yuhao could clearly sense that greatness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Terrorclaw and Life Gold’s energies seemed to cause a continuing cycle of destruction and construction within Huo Yuhao’s palm, while the destruction was going at a furious rate, it was no match for the restorative powers from the Life Gold. Meaning the condition of Huo Yuhao’s right palm had stabilized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although stable, it still brought about untold amounts of pain. This was Huo Yuhao’s first time feeling such pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s destructive energies brought him great pain, while the Life Gold’s restorative properties caused him to feel a great numbness. The contrasting feelings made Huo Yuhao undergo a whole new kind of torture! Even though he had once experienced the immense pain from the Ice Jade Empress’ Torso bone, Huo Yuhao still found himself sweating buckets! Bead after bead of sweat rolled down his forehead, his shirt becoming drenched very quickly, and his body starting to give off a faint mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong had never seen Huo Yuhao in such unbearable pain before. Which left him shocked and speechless at the current scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His cultivation and physique weren’t that different from that of Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao’s. Wang Dong had seen how Xiao Xiao ended up after attempting to fuse with the soul bone. After a short and fleeting resistance—Xiao Xiao gave up. Showing just how unbearable this pain, really was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was possibly bearing even more pain than Xiao Xiao had! As Huo Yuhao’s fusion partner, Wang Dong could get a feel for his current condition. The slight sensations he could feel through their spiritual connection caused Wang Dong to shiver internally as Huo Yuhao bore the astonishing pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With this, Wang Dong finally realized how strong Huo Yuhao was mentally. Even as his body gave off the occasional twitch, Huo Yuhao sat very stably. His facial expressions remained entirely the same, his brows never even furrowed once. While the beads of perspiration rolled down his face, intermittent subtle crackling sounds came from his right palm. Wang Dong couldn’t bear to watch anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t alone in his shock either. Elder Xuan had cultivated for hundreds of years, and had seen the bearings of many soul masters. While he could tell that Huo Yuhao was using that magical carving knife to suppress the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s power, he was positive that Huo Yuhao had to endure greater pains himself. Relying solely on his resilient willpower and mind to bear with the pain. Could this be done by a 12-year-old-kid? Just how many trials had he faced to come out with such a terrifying will?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t know what Wang Dong and Elder Xuan were thinking, but he could feel that he was getting more accustomed to the pain. After all, it was focused in his right palm. When he had fused with the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion Torso bone before, the intense pain had spread over his entire body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could now start to sense what has been happening in his right palm. He discovered that his whole right hand was undergoing a special transformation. The bones that had felt crushed and destroyed, weren’t crushed at all—countless fine cracks had appeared all over their surface. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Right Palm Bone was fusing into his right hand through these small cracks. His bones were being destroyed under the pressure from the maniacal will, and restored by the overflowing life power. While the destruction wasn’t as intense, the pain was. Huo Yuhao’s right palm bone began to change as the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s power merged with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s bones had a layer of greenish-gold after they were nourished by the Life Gold. It demonstrated the presence of immense life power. But his right palm bone had turned a dark gold hue, similar to that of boundless space!</span></p>
