 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once such blood souls acted up, their vengeance would cause one’s soul to lose control. Those whose cultivation wasn’t strong enough might even experience their souls being drawn out from their bodies before being devoured. These blood souls were both domineering and vicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fight had only just started, but Ye Xishui had already unleashed her strongest skill. This showed that she was prepared to risk her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming turned serious when he saw the blood souls. “One person to one. We must seal them and not let them escape.” As he spoke, he lifted his hands. They each fired a beam of golden light, trapping two blood souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ten Class 9 soul engineers around Xu Tianran quickly scattered. They each unleashed their greatest skills to control one blood soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui laughed coldly. Bloody lights shone brightly in her eyes. Suddenly, her long hair turned blood-red. Her Blood Soul Demonpuppet surged into her body and fused with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, she grew twice as large. The clear and transparent blood-red on her body made her seem as if she was carved from a ruby. Bloody air currents surged in the air and spread instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boundless Blood Sea!” Ye Xishui screamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding buildings were instantly vaporized when they were touched by the Boundless Blood Sea, which began spreading outward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder she was an Ultimate Douluo and the strongest evil soul master in the Holy Ghost Church. Even in such a disadvantageous situation, she still managed to resist all the soul engineers around her! How confident was she?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran roared furiously. There was a wand in his hand, which was only a few centimeters long. There was a rainbow gem the size of a fist on it. He lifted this wand and pointed it at Ye Xishui. Suddenly, a rainbow beam of light descended from the sky, striking towards Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the strength of a high-energy compression array soul tool. He had used the four compression array soul tools to protect the people of the Sun Moon Empire before. This time, he used this small compression array soul tool to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui didn’t dodge. In fact, she couldn’t dodge at all. She made a lifting gesture. Suddenly, the blood sea surged upward and turned into a huge shield. It blocked the descending rainbow beam of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” A tremendous boom sounded. A powerful shockwave immediately spread. The eleven Class 9 soul engineers immediately unleashed protective soul barriers. Along with the barrier unleashed by the soul engineers from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion, they managed to block this shockwave and prevent it from spreading further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The terrifying explosion had just ended when a series of booms were continuously heard. The blood sea flipped and forcefully resisted the attack of the rainbow beam of light. However, those who were sharp could tell that the blood sea was shrinking. It was becoming smaller under the attack of the high-energy compression array soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A grin appeared on Xu Tianran’s face. Even an Ultimate Douluo stood no chance against high-energy compression array soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, he was relying mostly on the compression array soul tools. The soul engineers’ main job was to protect him and the imperial palace. This plan to kill was considered a first test. Once it was a success, they would invest much more money into the research of high-energy compression array soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was completely unaware that the Sun Moon Empire had already pumped much more money into their research of high-energy compression array soul tools than any other research. Kong Deming was leading the research, while seven Class 9 soul engineers formed the core members of the research team. The amount of resources and money that were drained couldn’t be properly measured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the strength of soul tool technology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui’s figure suddenly appeared in mid-air. She was still blood-red. Kong Deming instantly shifted in front of her, blocking her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They clashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming was flung out, his entire body shining with golden light, while Ye Xishui returned to the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless streaks of lights were aimed at her. The linked attacks were about to be unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The linked attacks of the other three beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions were still fine. The most terrifying one was the one that came from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion. It was a pitch-black soul ray, as thick as a water vat. Wherever it passed, deep cracks would be left in the air that couldn’t be mended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Ye Xishui’s expression changed slightly when she sensed the power of this soul ray. It was not weaker than the attack fired by a compression array soul tool.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion is actually so strong? No wonder Xu Tianran dares to lay his hands on me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about it was one thing. Dealing with it was another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red lights flashed, and three blood souls broke free from their restraints. They each blocked one linked attack from each of the three beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions. Those three blood souls cried out tragically, but the three linked attacks were resisted. And Ye Xishui directly resisted the attack from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was hit! Xu Tianran was delighted. He was fully aware of how powerful the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion’s linked attack was. It couldn’t be resisted by a human. Even an Ultimate Douluo couldn’t do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Kong Deming was to appraise it, he would even claim that a Class 10 soul engineer wouldn’t be able to block such an attack. If even an Ultimate Douluo was helpless, perhaps only a god could possibly resist it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was Ye Xishui dead?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bloody light dissipated, scattered and vanished in the air” No traces were left. Ye Xishui didn’t even scream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But, was she really dead?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful! She’s not dead!” Kong Deming suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this, a blood soul that was originally restrained by a Class 9 soul engineer suddenly blew apart and turned into blood rain. Ye Xishui seemed to be reborn from this blood rain. She pressed her palm against the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Class 9 soul engineer started to shine with countless streaks of light. They were activated protective barriers. However, a blood-red palm print still appeared at the next moment. His entire chest collapsed. He spat out fresh blood and flew back. In the air, a blood soul separated from Ye Xishui’s body and devoured the avenging spirit and soul that appeared after he died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui’s body instantly shone brightly with blood-red light. A strong wave of blood energy was sucked into her body. That Class 9 soul engineer turned into ash, scattering in the air. A terrifying pressure immediately rose, and intense bloody lights shone in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Class 9 soul engineer had died just like that. Furthermore, his strength also further boosted Ye Xishui’s powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the terrifying ability that an evil Ultimate Douluo possessed. Even such an impressive linked attack couldn’t kill her. She had even exploited the opportunity to kill a Class 9 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Kong Deming noticed that there were only eleven blood souls now. Evidently, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion’s attack wasn’t completely useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying attack was unleashed next. A strong beam of light descended. A rainbow glow formed in the sky once again. It was the second attack of the compression array soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s face contorted a little. Just like how Ye Xishui didn’t know he was this strong, he also didn’t expect an Ultimate Douluo to be so terrifying at full strength. When Ye Xishui was trapped in a life-and-death situation, she still managed to so easily kill a Class 9 soul engineer under him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui groaned, and her body instantly turned blood-red. When that rainbow glow landed, her entire body turned into a bloody fog and disappeared once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, another blood soul blew apart. Just like before, she smacked her palm against a Class 9 soul engineer’s chest. It was as if she had smacked a piece of tofu. That Class 9 soul engineer was killed just like that. His blood energy and soul were devoured. Although there was one less blood soul because of this, Ye Xishui’s aura became stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of special spell is this? Why is it so terrifying? Even though she has fewer and fewer blood souls, it’s as if she’s accumulating her power!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was terrifying, as no one could see where her limit was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Force the blood souls away. Force them in. Attack!” Kong Deming commanded loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one knew Ye Xishui’s weak spot. They could only give it a go. From the start, he didn’t think that they could easily kill an Ultimate Douluo. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have made such heavy preparations. Right now, they could only try to prolong the fight. It was only this way that they could tire her out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui snorted coldly, and her body suddenly turned into countless blood projections, which swept out in all directions instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion, which was about to unleash their linked attack, lost their target instantly. It was almost impossible to lock onto her now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their many layers of linked defensive barriers were still very effective. They managed to block the invasion of the bloody lights. The Class 9 soul engineers within the barriers also took this opportunity to retreat to the edges of the barriers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the bloody lights dissipated and Ye Xishui reappeared, the barriers shrank in. This was a unified move performed by the remaining Class 9 soul engineers under Kong Deming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As immense pressure squeezed in, a frightening power rose. The Class 9 soul engineers instantly shifted. They moved to the outer perimeter just as the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion retracted their linked defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The original plan was to kill Ye Xishui in one move. Now that they couldn’t do that anymore, they could only slowly drain her using their overall power. This was the backup plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this backup plan, the most important thing to do was to help everyone retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two Class 9 soul engineers were already dead. This was something the Sun Moon Empire couldn’t accept. Veins were already visible on Xu Tianran’s forehead. If not for fear that the high-energy compression array soul tools would overheat, he would have attacked relentlessly by now.</span></p>
