 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 15.2: Three Months</strong></p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao, I didn’t think that the quality of your roasted fish would be so high. How about this. After I treat you to dinner, you can treat me to some roasted fish. How does that sound?” Wang Dong spoke with an excited expression as he recalled the delicious fragrance of the roasted fish he’d just eaten.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but laugh. “You couldn’t possibly want to eat roasted fish every night, could you? Even if it’s as tasty as you say it is, you’ll still get tired of it if you eat it too much.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong replied, “No worries, I don’t care. Let’s talk about that when I’ve managed to satisfy my cravings. It’s settled; I want to eat four roasted fish tomorrow night! Two fishes just weren’t enough to satisfy me! Besides, did you see how many people were in line today? I think that you should sell a few more fish, it doesn’t waste too much time anyway. If you don’t, we’ll finish eating them before you’ve even started selling them!”</p>
 <p>By this time, the two had already packed up and returned to their dormitory. Before returning to their rooms, they decided to head to the canteen to get some dinner.</p>
 <p>“Wang Dong, since my eldest senior brother gave me another Mysterious Water Pill, do you think that I should eat it or the Soul Advancement Pill first?” Huo Yuhao took out the two pills and asked Wang Dong. Wang Dong was clearly more knowledgeable than him in the field of medicinal pills. After receiving the two pills, Huo Yuhao was truly feeling somewhat impatient. If he added the medicinal properties of the two pills to his own cultivation, he wouldn’t be behind the other students in their class anymore.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong thought for a while, before replying, “I’d recommend that you not be so eager to take these two pills; at least, for the time being.”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Huo Yuhao asked with a puzzled expression.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong replied, “Think about it. You just used a Mysterious Water Pill yesterday. A lot of your body’s impurities have already been flushed out. The medicinal efficacy of the Mysterious Water Pill will stay in your body for a period of time, but will be dissolved as you continue to meditate. If you take any other medicine right now, even though it’ll still have some partial effects, you’ll waste some of its medicinal power. The Mysterious Water Pill and the Soul Advancement Pill can both be described with the words ‘Heavenly Treasure’. Since you have such precious pills, you should naturally make full use of them. I suggest that you cultivate for around ten days or so; wait until your body has managed to fully absorb the effects of the first Mysterious Water Pill before you use the second one. You’ll be able to improve your physique by a step, while increasing your soulforce at the same time. Once you’ve finished absorbing the medicinal effects of the Mysterious Water Pills, both your physique and passageways will have had a rather large improvement. If you then use the Soul Advancement Pill—since your body will be free of obstructions—you’ll naturally be able to obtain the greatest amount of benefits possible.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt that Wang Dong’s analysis was extremely reasonable. “Thanks, I’m lucky that you told me about all of this now. If you hadn’t, I wouldn’t have known how to use them effectively. What about you? Are you going to eat your’s today?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong nodded his head and said, “I’m already at rank twenty one; my physique and passageways are in extremely good condition. It’s naturally perfect for me to absorb the Soul Advancement Pill as soon as possible. When I eat it, I’ll be able to dissolve its medicinal power in a single night. Hehe, I’ll be at rank twenty two tomorrow, or possibly even rank twenty three! Didn’t senior Xiao Ya say that she’d let me enter the Tang Sect if I rank first in the freshmen's assessment? After eating this Soul Advancement Pill, I’m even more certain that I’ll be able to achieve first place. Alright, I’m going to start now. You should go and cultivate by yourself.”</p>
 <p>After he’d finished speaking, he took out the walnut-sized Soul Advancement Pill and popped it into his mouth. He bit into it softly, causing an extremely strong fragrance to immediately gush out of the pill. Wang Dong inhaled softly, then immediately began to suck a green liquid out from the pill. He didn’t even waste the pill’s outer shell; he popped it into his mouth and chewed it a few times before swallowing it.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the dorm became suffused with a natural fragrance that resembled a cluster of ten thousand flowers. Huo Yuhao’s mind felt refreshed, while all thirty-six thousand of his pores seemed to open up accordingly, causing a hard-to-describe stimulation to spread through his entire body. He didn’t dare to waste any time, hurriedly sitting on the ground in a cross-legged position to take advantage of the fact that his soulforce had been adjusted to an optimum state for cultivation.</p>
 <p>After the baptism of the Mysterious Water Pill, cultivation was simply a form of pleasure for Huo Yuhao. He quickly entered a meditative state, then began to circulate the Mysterious Heaven Technique without any obstructions. It permeated throughout his body while simultaneously increasing his soulforce slowly, albeit at a very stable rate.</p>
 <p>A faint jade light gradually started to emerge from Wang Dong’s body, followed by the strong refreshing aura that was circulating throughout the room. Some of it was absorbed by Huo Yuhao, but even more of it was inhaled by Wang Dong as he practiced his breathing exercises. Under the stimulation of the Soul Advancement Pill, his soulforce had begun to increase at a startling rate.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After the twists and turns that had occurred to him two days ago, Huo Yuhao’s school life started to calm down. Not only that, but he’d gradually begun to gain some fame. Practically all of the students and teachers who’d tried his roasted fish had unceasingly praised it.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao increased the number of fish he sold from twenty to thirty, but he was still far from satisfying the desires of the students and teachers. However, he wasn’t willing to make any more, as he still needed most of his time for cultivation.</p>
 <p>For the sake of a single roasted fish, many students would rush out of the school once class ended. Moreover, because of the high demand for his roasted fish, he had no choice but to impose a limit of one fish per person. However, although the demand for his roasted fish was as high as it was, Huo Yuhao never increased his price, causing him to receive unanimous positive reviews from the students. Furthermore, he even made several new friends.</p>
 <p>The number one beauty of the outer courtyard, Jiang Nannan, still ended up eating one of his roasted fish in the end, though she queued up by herself in order to buy it. However, the more interesting thing was that, even though Xu Sanshi wasn’t able to please Jiang Nannan with the roasted fish, he also liked its taste. Hence, he became one of Huo Yuhao’s most faithful customers.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the first three months of school had passed. Under Zhou Yi’s teaching, which was strict to the point of being perverted, Class 1 could be said to have completely transformed. However, the upper echelon of the academy was slightly astonished by the fact that there were actually between sixty and seventy students left from the three month baptism of Class 1, which Zhou Yi had been in charge of. This was leagues apart from the school’s one-third estimate.</p>
 <p>If one were to ask who’d changed the most in all of Class 1 during these three months, the answer would undoubtedly be Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>When he entered the academy, his soulforce had merely been rank eleven. In addition to that, he’d just obtained his soul ring. His strength had been absolutely dead last when ranked in the academy, without any suspense at all.</p>
 <p>However, after these three months, Huo Yuhao had completely changed. Furthermore, not one person had challenged him for his position as class monitor since he’d taken up the role.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t because Huo Yuhao had used his strength to astonish everyone, or that no one could beat him. Instead, it was because his vigor had sparked the admiration of the students in Class 1. This was the main reason that two-thirds of the class was able to persevere in Class 1, even under Zhou Yi’s strict teaching.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was truly too hard working. Practically all of the teachers who taught Class 1 knew of his existence. No matter when the class was, nor what lesson was going on, there would always be a pair of eyes focused on the teacher for the duration of the entire lesson; the owner entirely focused on listening to the teacher’s explanation.</p>
