Eat this first,” Huo Yuhao said as he passed the antidote he had prepared to Nan Shuishui. Nan Qiuqiu hurriedly took it for her mother and placed it in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then was Nan Shuishui able to react. Without even asking Huo Yuhao how he did it, she said in a low voice, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Leaving this place was the best thing that could happen to them. However, she did not expect it to be easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu hunched forward slightly to carry her mother. With one leap, she jumped out of the basement. The antidote needed time to take effect. The Soul Eradicating Powder was powerful, and it was impossible for Nan Shuishui to regain her powers in such a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao followed them out of the cellar. The secret behind why he was able to break the silver chains was naturally his Life Guardian Blade. Life Gold was able to devour the life energy of every solid object. It had even been able to gradually destroy the large door of the underground storage room in Radiant City. While the chain was strong, there was nothing it could do when faced with its greatest opponent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they rescued Nan Shuishui, Huo Yuhao felt an immense sense of relief. Now was not the best time to leave the city, as it was surely completely controlled by soldiers from the Sun Moon Empire. There was also a Beast Lord-ranked soul engineer legion around, too. Aerial surveillance soul tools no doubt covered the skies above Sunrise City once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After so many battles, both Huo Yuhao’s soul power and spiritual power were greatly depleted. The best course of action now was to hide. Then, when the chance presented itself, they could sneak out of the city. With Nan Shuishui, a Soul Douluo around, they had a good chance of breaking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where do we go now?” Nan Qiuqiu asked Huo Yuhao in a low voice. Since he was using his Imitation, they had no fear of being detected by aerial surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “We’ll go back to the hotel first. Feng Ling is still there. While it’s close to the southern part of the city, we have yet to be exposed. We’ll go back to rest first. After aunty has regained her strength, we’ll find another way to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I’ll listen to you.” Huo Yuhao had fulfilled his promise and helped her save her mother. Any unhappiness Nan Qiuqiu had had with Huo Yuhao before this was completely wiped clean. All that remained was respect and shame. She suddenly realized that he was able to provide her with a strong sense of security. She gradually understood how Ye Guyi’s curiosity eventually left her infatuated with Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s really exceptional, and he’s mature beyond his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui, lying on her daughter’s back, said nothing. The antidote started to kick in, and she started to gather her soul power once more. Right now, Sunrise City was danger-ridden. Nothing was more important than regaining her soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Every single street was being monitored very closely. The soldiers used sound-amplifying soul tools to issue orders, instructing all civilians not to leave their homes. They then used various types of surveillance soul tools to search each and every building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, one could see blue dots of light flashing by frequently. This indicated the presence of the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stood in front. He unleashed his Imitation, and was able to walk right by the waves of soldiers as he quickly walked in the direction of the hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he walked, he whispered to Nan Qiuqiu, “Don’t rush to return later. We should observe our surroundings. If the hotel is being searched, they will have found Feng Ling. I don’t know what they will make of him. I just hope that they have not yet searched that place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu nodded and said, “That guy is so dumb. What if he is discovered?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao frowned and said, “Let’s see the situation first. If we can save him, we should save him. He’s a poor sod.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu’s mouth twitched as she said, “I heard Third Senior Brother say that he’s a gangster. He probably did many bad things before. This is his comeuppance…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned to look at her and said, “Stop being so harsh. He’s already in such a sorry state.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu stuck out her tongue and said, “Fine, fine, I’ll listen to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled slightly and quickened his pace. After they saved Nan Shuishui, Nan Qiuqiu acted much more mature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they navigated their way through many alleys and backstreets, avoiding many patrolling soldiers in the process, they finally saw their hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no soldiers patrolling the front of the hotel. The alleys all seemed very quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao suddenly felt his forehead turning hot. His Eye of Destiny seemed to have shivered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eh?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mind shook, and he deployed his Spiritual Detection like a fisherman casting his net, enveloping everything within a 500-meter radius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To Huo Yuhao, his Spiritual Detection was more useful than his eyes. It had helped him turn the tides of countless battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his Eye of Destiny trembled, it seemed to be warning him. However, after he used his Spiritual Detection, he discovered nothing. Everything seemed normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Nan Qiuqiu saw him stop, she nudged him and asked, “What’s wrong? Is everything alright?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “Let’s go. We’ll return to the hotel to see if Feng Ling is still there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said that, he and Nan Qiuqiu flipped over a wall to enter the hotel. For safety, he continued to us his Imitation to conceal himself as he slipped into the hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quickly, he walked to the room where Feng Ling had been. With his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao could sense that Feng Ling was still in his room, alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slowly pushed the door open, and just as expected, Feng Ling lay on the bed like before. He was curled up, and seemed to be mumbling something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu sighed in relief as she said, “It appears that they have yet to search this place. Our luck isn’t bad. Yuhao, why don’t we hide him? Let’s bring him out of the hotel first. What if the soldiers find him here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao appeared to not have heard Nan Qiuqiu’s words. He stood there and he looked straight ahead. He touched his forehead with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Between his brows, his Eye of Destiny was shaking rapidly. This was the first time he had encountered something like this. The pressure he felt made him deeply uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, let’s go,” Huo Yuhao said as he suddenly pulled Nan Qiuqiu. He did not even let her put Nan Shuishui down as he ran out of the room with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he ran out the door, a huge rumble could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This terrifying shockwave was accompanied by a terrifying rain of carnage. Despite Huo Yuhao’s quick reflexes, the huge energy still hit him from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart ran cold. He knew that he was being ambushed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more dangerous the situation, the calmer Huo Yuhao was. He grabbed Nan Qiuqiu with his right hand as he said in a low voice, “Flying-type soul tool.” At the same time, he maximized his spiritual power. He unleashed his Spiritual Interference and Imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu was still carrying Nan Shuishui. While she wanted to deploy her flying-type soul tool, her hands could only fumble at it clumsily. At this moment, Huo Yuhao had already released his flying-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he did not care about whether his actions were ‘appropriate’ anymore. He grabbed her by the waist as his flying-type soul tool propelled him upward. He punched the ceiling with his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom! Boom!” &nbsp;Two explosions rang out. Two holes appeared in the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, one could see that a huge swathe of light had covered the sky outside. The very air trembled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how dumb Nan Qiuqiu was, she now understood the severity of the situation. She did not struggle, but instead used her soul power to try and make her mother and herself lighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s embrace was warm and brimmed with masculinity. The light outside flashed. A layer of golden light started to shine from Huo Yuhao’s body as he used his Invincible Barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his Spiritual Interference Domain, Imitation, and Invincible Barrier, Huo Yuhao was completely protected and concealed. His Butterfly Wings spewed out light as he flew out of one of the two holes as fast as he could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was clear that this was his only chance. They were definitely surrounded. As to why, he had an inkling. It definitely had something to do with Feng Ling, who had been blown apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go back,” a raspy old voice said in mid-air. With that, Huo Yuhao felt like a moth who had flown into a huge net as something forcibly blocked his ascent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could not go back. No way!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was clear that if his next attack was blocked, there would be no chance of escape!</span></p>

It was the Fist of Remembrance, a fist which contained a surging feeling of remembrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A layer of white light appeared after being struck by this punch. A shadow materialized outside the screen of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw this person, the look of longing in Huo Yuhao’s eyes faded. Nan Shuishui, who was on Nan Qiuqiu’s back, recoiled forcefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the person who was now looking down on them from outside the barrier was none other than the Third Elder from the Holy Ghost Church. He was also Nan Shuishui’s former lover, who had imprisoned her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only that, but blue figures also appeared outside the light barrier, surrounding Huo Yuhao and the three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then the Fourth Elder appeared, and a group of people clad in black appeared behind the Third Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Trapped!</span></p>

Those were last-resort moves. Once he used them all, he could no longer control his emotions. If that happened, how could he leave with Nan Qiuqiu and Nan Shuishui?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stopped using his Imitation, revealing the three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul engineers from the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion all wielded a soul tool each. They aimed their soul tools at Huo Yuhao and his companions. With just one order, they would open fire at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the ground, a bunch of carefully-positioned soul tools started to become visible. Powerful soul power fluctuations were everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a truly well-planned trap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder looked at Nan Shuishui before he turned his gaze to Huo Yuhao. He clapped his hands lightly and said, “You’re skillful indeed, and full of tricks and schemes. With just a few of you, you actually dared to mount a rescue mission, which succeeded. I can’t help but admire you. At your age, I was still a clueless youth. If I had half of your powers, no one would have been able to steal my lover from me.” When he said that last bit, he could not help but look at Nan Shuishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui wore a heavy expression on her face. She sighed and said, “They’re still kids. Let them go. I’ll return with you. I’ll do whatever you want me to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ll do whatever I ask you to? What can you do for me? Hahahaha...” the Third Elder laughed shrilly. “Had this been twenty-five years ago, how happy I would have been to hear you say that! However, it’s too late now. This should be your daughter, right? Look, she resembles you so much! Do you think you have a chance of leaving me anymore? I can’t do anything to you, but I won’t let you leave me. Don’t worry, I won’t kill you or your daughter. If I kill her, you’ll be sad. I’ll let her accompany you. As for this bastard here, I can’t decide his fate. Wu Yu, do you have anything you want to say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They are the butchers, and I’m the meat.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;thought Huo Yuhao. He could not help but despair. Despite his many calculations, he had still slipped up. He knew that he had been exposed because of Feng Ling, who had died from the explosion. He did not hate Feng Ling, because he was controlled by the evil soul masters. No matter how resolute he was, however, Huo Yuhao could not help but lose hope in this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was facing two evil Titled Douluo, with one of them being a Class 9 soul engineer. Furthermore, there was a Beast Lord-ranked soul engineer legion with hundreds of men nearby, as well as the soul tools which had long been placed in position underneath him. There was no escape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yu, who was clad in a huge cloak, floated up next to the Third Elder and asked Huo Yuhao sharply, “You killed my sister?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your sister?” Huo Yuhao looked at her suspiciously.</span></p>

When Huo Yuhao saw the pale, familiar face with its blood-red eyes, he felt his heart tremble. His questions were finally answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had the same vengeance-filled faces and blood-red eyes. Here was another one who possessed the Spirit of Vengeance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are twin sisters, right?” Huo Yuhao asked bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right. Did you kill my sister? Why? Why? You’re so weak, how could you have killed my sister?” Wu Yu shrieked hysterically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “Your sister died peacefully. That’s right, I killed her. However, to her, death was the best release. Both of you possess a Spirit of Vengeance, which is immensely strong. However, your lives are both cursed. Is this feeling good? Your sister died because she sensed my love for my lover. My emotions destroyed her Spirit of Vengeance, and hence, she died. Actually, to her, death was a form of purification and elevation.”</span></p>
