It didn’t leave its cave because it was too weak. At the same time, it was also trying to protect its two kids!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s heart softened when he sensed this. That was because he immediately recalled how his mother had protected him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, the three evil soul masters’ target wasn’t just the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. They were targeting its two kids too! With their abilities, no one knew how these two infant Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears were going to be exploited if they were captured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">We have to stop them!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same thought arose in Cai Mei’er, Zhang Lexuan, and Huo Yuhao’s minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Zhong Litian said, “Watch me. I’m going to make a move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er nodded and turned around at the same time before gesturing to the group from Shrek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her gesture seemed very simple, but every inner courtyard disciple knew what she meant... all-out attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undoubtedly, their target wasn’t the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Litian’s back was facing everyone. He didn’t seem to realize anything, or perhaps he was too self-confident. He lifted his staff slowly, and greyish scales started to engulf his body once again. His soul rings also drifted into everyone’s view for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was left with a deep impression as they sensed the capabilities of this evil soul master from a close distance. A thick bloody aura swept over them, and everyone felt as if they were surrounded by corpses. The awful smell left them nauseous, and it was even getting difficult to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A piercing scream suddenly resonated. This scream was similar to that of the Darkgolden Terroclaw Bear’s screams earlier. The only difference was that this scream was louder, and sounded more furious. It also seemed to contain a sense of unbearable pain. A huge bloody light projection surfaced from Zhong Litian’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. Its terrifying figure was greater than seven meters in height. When it appeared, its aura shook the surrounding trees and plants. However, it wasn’t a solid entity. Its figure was half-transparent, and its frightening aura revealed an indescribable pain. Its spirit was even trembling, distorting, and trying to struggle. However, it couldn’t break free. It could only vent its torment by screaming pathetically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the red Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s spirit started to roar, Huo Yuhao could sense that the body of the bear that had just given birth turned rigid. In the next moment, a hysterical and forlorn roar was released from this female bear. She couldn’t be bothered about her kids in the cave anymore. As her huge palm pressed onto the ground, she exited the cave and started to burst forward rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Too despicable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao understood everything soon after. The spirit that Zhong Litian revealed must have had some close connection to the female bear in the cave. It might even have been her partner, and the father of the two infant bears!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, why did he do that? The male bear was likely to be stronger considering the strength of its spirit. Since the three of them could kill the male bear, why couldn’t they deal with the female bear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a thought flashed across Huo Yuhao’s mind. He was reminded of what Wang Yan had mentioned before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were very few Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears. That was why they couldn’t use the strength of their species to rule the world of soul beasts even though they were individually very strong. However, why were there so few of them? Logically speaking, they should be better able to survive considering their immensely strong abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only one reason – their reproductive capabilities. They were bestowed with great strength, but were devoid of reproductive capabilities. Generally speaking, it was very difficult for a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear to find a partner. That was because they would roam the world of soul beasts alone after they matured. They would also be invincible among all soul beasts of the same level. This characteristic was also a reason why it was difficult for them to carry on their lineage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when a male and female Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear met, they had to be interested in each other before they could mate. Wang Yan joked that Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears had different aesthetic standards compared to humans. It was very unlikely for two bears of opposing genders to fall for each other. If it was one-sided, violence might be a means to earn the rights to copulation. However, a female bear might still be able to resist a male bear even if she couldn’t beat him. Both parties would be hurt as a result. Even if a male bear got his way, he might not be able to carry on his lineage. That was because the male and female beasts might not be sexually compatible, and thus the male bear’s genes would be unable to be passed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s estrus cycle was only once every ten years… Each female bear could only bear one to two kids. Under such a situation, it was very difficult for them to prosper. Once every ten years! It wasn’t even a certainty. Some male bears might not even have their own kids for their entire life. This was the sad truth that Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears had to face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sadder thing was that they belonged in the same world as humans. Legend had it that a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s cub could be tamed by humans. If they could be successfully tamed, the owner would possess terrifying fighting strength. Humans had also been trying their best to find their own cubs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just humans either. Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear cubs would treat all females as their mother due to their strong survival abilities and unyielding desire to survive. No matter who they were captured by, they treated them as their kin as long as they were nurtured properly. That was why some highly intelligent creatures would try to lay their hands on Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears were also very proud creatures. When they discovered that they couldn’t overcome their opponent using their own abilities, they would carry out an unthinkable and cruel action… killing their own cubs! They would rather let their kids cubs than let the enemy benefit. This made it even more difficult for the lineage of Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears to be passed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Wang Yan had recounted this, his emotions had flowed. However, Huo Yuhao finally understood the three Zhong Li brothers’ intention when he recalled all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could certainly overcome the weakened female bear, but their targets were the two cubs. At this point, they were drawing the mother bear out using the male bear before Zhong Lidi and Zhong Liren went and kidnapped the two cubs. This would help them complete this task successfully, while those from Shrek Academy were just cannon fodder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, the three brothers had planned this out from the start. The female bear was in a maniacal state right now. As she approached, she would most certainly turn violent when she saw humans. Zhong Litian could also exploit this opportunity to escape. Zhong Litian could tell that there was at least a Soul Douluo among them. After they depleted some of the mother bear’s energy, she wouldn’t be able to escape once the three brothers attacked her. It was a perfect plan! While it was a coincidence that the three brothers met them, they wanted to exploit this coincidence to achieve their goals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao figured all this out in an instant. He also activated his Spiritual Detection at the first instant and shared his thoughts with everyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Attack now.” Cai Mei’er reacted decisively, and didn’t hesitate any further. She lifted her right hand, and a gust of strong wind burst from her hand. It was aimed towards Zhong Litian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhong Litian turned into a waft of green smoke at this moment. He disappeared into the brutal winds, while the bloody male bear turned back. As he roared furiously, he clawed towards them with a tormented look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was his spiritual power. Although his spiritual power had been enhanced by the evil soul masters, it wasn’t as strong as it was when he was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the female bear had crawled out of her cave and was rushing forward with big steps. Her husband’s voice was too familiar. His tormented screams and her yearning for him overcame her will to protect her kids. The three brothers exploited her feelings. Even though they were despicable, their evil thoughts were very unpredictable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Cai Mei’er hadn’t expected such a disadvantageous situation. The strength of these two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears was already very great. However, they were still strong enough to deal with these two bears. After all, Cai Mei’er was a Titled Douluo. The missing three brothers were the problem. How long would they take to capture the two cubs? Would mercy be shown when they returned? By then, everyone from Shrek would have been weakened by these two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears. Today’s fight was very perilous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What do we do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This same thought appeared in everyone’s minds. The first person to react was Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
