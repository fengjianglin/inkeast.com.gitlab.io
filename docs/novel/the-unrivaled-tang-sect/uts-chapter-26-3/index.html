 <p><strong>Book 4: The Golden Road</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 26.3</strong><strong>: National Treasure, Cauldron's Trembling Shake&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Because he wasn’t able to use his force-neutralising soul skill due to Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock, he was sent flying.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Xiao Xiao’s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron clearly didn’t have enough power to threaten him. After his enormous body landed on the ground, he instantly bounced back up into the air.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had a stunned look on his face. When he’d used his Spiritual Shock on Xie Huanyue, he’d clearly been able to feel it slow down upon touching his fleshy skin. Furthermore, his spiritual power had also been filtered before it entered Xie Huanyue’s brain. In the end, he’d only been dazed for an instant, which was about as effective as when he’d used it on Ma Xiaotao. <em>Just what kind of martial soul is that!? How can it be this troublesome?!</em></p>
 <p>The pressure surrounding Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao suddenly increased, which Wang Dong was naturally able to sense via Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. A cold light flickered through his eyes as his wings suddenly flashed, forcefully shoving the Luo brothers backwards. Immediately afterwards, his second soul ring lit up.</p>
 <p>The dazzling Light of the Butterfly Goddess once again appeared on the battlefield. Even though it didn’t have a lock-on effect, Wang Dong definitely wouldn’t miss his target, due to the foresight that Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection gave him.</p>
 <p>The Luo brothers naturally wouldn’t just stand there and wait to be defeated, but didn’t have a support skill like Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. As such, their reaction speed was much slower than Wang Dong’s. By the time they’d readied their second soul skill, Wang Dong had already released his.</p>
 <p>The Luo brothers sent out several tens of blade lights from their Mantis Blades in an attempt to stop Wang Dong’s Light of the Butterfly Goddess, but it was all for naught. They were completely inferior to Wang Dong in all aspects, regardless of whether it was their soul rank, the quality of their martial souls, or even the age of their soul rings. A golden light flickered outwards as Wang Dong’s Light of the Butterfly Goddess released its full power, forcefully blasting them away. However, the instant that their soul skills were broken, the proctor in charge of the match rushed into the arena like a ghost, retrieved them from the golden light, then left like a bolt of lightning. Evidently, he’d determined that the Luo brothers would’ve suffered heavy injuries from Wang Dong’s attack. Thus, he’d interfered in the match. However, his interference signified that they’d be unable to continue any further.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s accurate judgement, high attack power, and prompt decision making skills were all acknowledged by the teachers watching their match. However, in the instant that Wang Dong had triumphed over his opponents, Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao were in the middle of taking on Xie Huanyue’s all-out attack.</p>
 <p>In reality, the total strength of Xie Huanyue’s team was weaker than that of Ning Tian’s team; there was an insurmountable distance between the Luo brothers and Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun’er due to the massive gap in quality between their martial souls. However, the teachers had privately evaluated all of the Soul Elders within the freshmen classes, and Xie Huanyue’s had ended up ranked higher than Ning Tian. It could be seen how tyrannical he was from this.</p>
 <p>After falling from the sky again, Xie Huanyue’s second soul ring lit up. Huo Yuhao repeated his old tactic and sent another Spiritual Shock towards him. At the same time, Xiao Xiao made a move with her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. Their current objective was to drag the fight out between the three of them for as long as they could, so that they could wait for Wang Dong to return. When he did, they’d use the combined strength of all three of them to take on Xie Huanyue.</p>
 <p>However, although Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was able to detect where his opponents would move, he wasn’t able to find out the specific soul skill they were planning to use.</p>
 <p>Xia Huanyue's second soul ring suddenly lit up while he was still in midair, and he waved his originally stocky right arm. Just as Huo Yuhao activated his Spiritual Shock, Xie Huanyue's arm grew longer, and suddenly smacked all three of Xiao Xiao's Threelives Soulcrush Cauldrons that were flying towards him away with surprising accuracy.</p>
 <p>Even though Xiao Xiao immediately activated her Cauldron Shock skill, Xie Huanyue’s arm simply smashed through it. His monstrous strength had actually sent all three of her cauldrons flying. Immediately afterwards, his ball-like body descended from the sky. He extended the hand that he’d used to sweep the cauldrons away once again, and sent it towards Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>He was affected by the Spiritual Shock for too short a time, and his control over his soul skills had reached the pinnacle; this was true foresight. After predicting the instant that Huo Yuhao would activated his Spiritual Shock, he’d used his own soul skill to escape danger by a hair’s breadth. He’d placed himself in a winning position in but an instant.</p>
 <p>Even though Xiao Xiao possessed two martial souls, her close-combat skills were extremely lacking. She’d always considered herself to be a control system Soul Master, not an assault or agility system Soul Master. As such, she wasn’t too experienced in combat. When Xie Huanyue’s enormous body fell towards her, she was left somewhat blank.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao suddenly rushed towards her from behind and grabbed her waist. With a flash, his body swayed like a demon, allowing the two of them to evade Xie Huanyue’s decisive blow. Afterwards, he immediately rolled on the ground with Xiao Xiao in tow, allowing them to escape the weight of Xie Huanyue’s body.</p>
 <p>“Pu—” Even though Xie Huanyue’s enormous body had landed, the sound of a heavy collision didn’t ring out. This time around, he didn’t bounce back into the air; he rolled on the ground, following Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>This occurred just as Wang Dong defeated the Luo brothers by releasing his god-like powers, in turn causing Xie Huanyue to feel pressured. If he wasn’t able to defeat Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao before Wang Dong returned... he didn’t have any confidence that he’d be able to beat them in a 1v3.</p>
 <p>The third soul ring on his fat body finally lit up, which caused his body to instantly be illuminated purple. This caused Xie Huanyue to look like an enormous purple ball. Following a low growl, a strong purple halo erupted from his body, allowing him to immediately catch up to Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>In that crucial moment, Huo Yuhao displayed the true quality of a man; he instantly stood up from his rolling position and exerted force through his arms, thrusting Xiao Xiao into the air—Xie Huanyue wouldn’t be able to attack her while she was up there.</p>
 <p>“Yuhao—”</p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao—”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao simultaneously cried out, but the tyranical purple halo around Xie Huanyue’s body had already collided with Huo Yuhao’s. Huo Yuhao’s entire body shook, and a purple halo rose from his feet. He stood there unmoving, while his Spiritual Detection Sharing instantly disappeared.</p>
 <p>A figure flashed as the proctor pulled Huo Yuhao out of the arena just before Xie Huanyue’s enormous body could crush him. This prevented him from becoming a meat patty beneath the meatball...</p>
 <p>Xie Huanyue silently cursed his bad luck. However, he was still completely confident in himself. <em>Defeating a Soul Master who only has a ten year soul ring isn’t useful at all. That twin-souled Soul Grandmaster managed to escape. However, it seems like I still have a chance to win this battle!</em> The Luo brothers were just his subordinates; he was the true source of combat power on his team. He was confident that he could use his three rings’ strength to face two Soul Grandmasters, and felt that his chance of victory was still above 70%.</p>
