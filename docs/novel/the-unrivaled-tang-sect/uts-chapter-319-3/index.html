In everyone’s opinion, he should have struck Huo Yuhao first. However, Wang Yanfeng’s body stopped in the air when Huo Yuhao unleashed his palm. He snapped his double palms back before striking out against Huo Yuhao’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!...&nbsp;</span></p>

The protective barriers around the stage started to ripple.</span></p>

But Wang Yanfeng had already been struck backward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took three steps back before he managed to steady himself, each step slamming loudly onto the metal plates of the arena stage. His upper body trembled slightly, and his face started to flush.</span></p>

If not for the fact that he couldn’t move his legs, his advantage might have been even greater.</span></p>

There weren’t any flowery tricks. It was a battle of their abilities.</span></p>

Right now, she burst out like a bolt of lightning. She flashed out, and appeared above Wang Yanfeng’s head. She flipped around in the air and struck her palm toward his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Huo Yuhao’s golden eyes suddenly turned purplish-gold. Two streaks of purplish-gold light shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng only saw a patch of purplish-gold light in front of him. Following this, his very soul seemed to have been struck, and everything turned white.</span></p>

He had earned his Soul Emperor cultivation through his own efforts. Furthermore, his spiritual power was greater than most ordinary soul masters, since the Body Sect was very skilled in the research of fighting techniques.</span></p>

However, the barrier turned icy-blue instantly, and the temperature around it also fell significantly. While the Snow Lady’s palm seemed very soft and gentle, it was actually even stronger than Huo Yuhao’s palm strike earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Body Sect uses soul tools too? Didn’t teacher mention that they were very rigid in this aspect? It seems like they are also keeping up!</span></p>

However, the barrier helped Wang Yanfeng avert this crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Yuhao was startled by his opponent’s Invincible Barrier, he didn’t stop his attack. Even with the Invincible Barrier, Wang Yanfeng was still in a trance after being hit by the Spiritual Shock. He was like a practice target as he stood in place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The barrier could protect him from absolute harm. However, his soul power would be greatly depleted if the Invincible Barrier were struck repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao raised his right hand, and a dark-golden projection slashed down like a huge heavenly ax. When the five streaks of light appeared, all the spectators felt a chill down their spines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!...&nbsp;</span></p>

Huo Yuhao’s claws pushed Wang Yanfeng’s barrier three feet into the ground. It was his Darkgolden Terrorclaw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady wasn’t idle either. A deep blue light flashed, and coordinated with Huo Yuhao’s attack perfectly. When the dark-golden blades disappeared, an icy-blue light blade of light struck the barrier ferociously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!...</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What did this mean? It meant that the defense of the barrier was about to be overcome! This also meant that Huo Yuhao and the Snow Lady’s repeated attacks bore an offensive power that had reached a terrifying level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady’s attacks were all Ultimate Ice and Snow. Along with the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s destructiveness and Wang Yanfeng’s inability to directly control his barrier due to his shock, such a situation had occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Yanfeng also recovered from the shock to his soul after this attack.</span></p>

Horrified, he quickly retreated. At the same time, his third soul ring lit up. His hands formed fists in front of him, and he punched out towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Wang Yanfeng’s body soul’s third soul skill, Mountainquake Strike!</span></p>

He struck his palm towards the ground and leaned back. A row of jets appeared on his shoulders. When his wheelchair was propelled into the air by the rebound from his palm strike, the jets were also fired. Instantly, he shot several dozen meters into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng’s attack was a measure to stop Huo Yuhao from attacking him anymore. With his current state, he wasn’t able to lock onto his opponent, so Huo Yuhao managed to easily dodge his Mountainquake Strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao was still given a scare by the strength of the Mountainquake Strike!</span></p>

It stopped for a moment in the air before blowing apart, converting into a greenish-black sphere more than five meters in diameter. The force of its explosion was immense.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He must have completed the Second Awakening of his martial soul!</span></p>

Who would have expected Huo Yuhao to fly so high up in the air even though he was in a wheelchair? Furthermore, he appeared very agile. His right hand was so powerful. How strong would he be if his whole body could move?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady had already returned behind Huo Yuhao’s back. She pushed his wheelchair through the air, and a deep blue light shot forward. In this manner, she managed to slide his wheelchair down through the air, landing on the other side of the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng also took this chance to catch his breath. When he saw Huo Yuhao on the other side of the stage, he felt helpless, and almost spat out blood in frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the main effect of Spiritual Shock had already disappeared, he still had a splitting headache right now. As he looked at Huo Yuhao, he felt fear rising inside. He hadn’t expected this opponent would be so difficult to deal with...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he sensed his own condition, he was on the verge of tears. His soul power had dropped by forty percent after he was hit by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock and the subsequent attacks. He only had sixty percent of his soul power left! His soul power was very dense, considering that he was from the Body Sect. Ordinary soul masters couldn’t compare to him at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Invincible Barrier had first appeared, it had indeed caused a lot of problems for soul masters. Soul engineers who were financially sound loved to use their Invincible Barrier to protect themselves when they fought, just before using their strongest soul tool against their soul master opponent. It was a move that left many soul masters feeling helpless and depressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, soul masters slowly found a way to deal with this as time passed, even though they couldn’t catch up to soul engineers in terms of technology. For example, they could launch an assault against the Invincible Barrier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the assault couldn’t harm their opponent, their soul power would fall significantly as the barrier came under attack. The stronger the assault, the greater the depletion. Of course, this was under the condition that the soul master wasn’t forced back by his opponent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used this fact to launch a few attacks, causing Wang Yanfeng’s soul power to fall by almost half. This would undoubtedly be very useful for the rest of the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Yanfeng wasn’t a simple character either. He turned around to face Huo Yuhao, but didn’t chase after him. He remained where he was and took a deep breath, initiating the circulation of his soul power. As he recovered from his headache, he tried to adjust his condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elites of top-ranked sects weren’t easy to deal with. Even under unfavorable circumstances, Wang Yanfeng didn’t panic at all. Rather, he analyzed the situation. Huo Yuhao’s flaw was too obvious. He needed his wheelchair to move. This meant that he couldn’t fight like Wang Qiu’er, using a high speed and tempo to overwhelm his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng was exploiting this opportunity to catch his breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he turned grim following this. That was because he saw Huo Yuhao brandishing a Milk Bottle, replenishing his own soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng had his own Milk Bottle, but there was one thing that Huo Yuhao had judged accurately. The Body Sect had a very strong distaste for soul tools. While it had become less acute in recent years, they only used soul tools that had practical uses to them. For example, Milk Bottles, flying-type soul tools, and protective-type soul tools, such as the Invincible Barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Yanfeng wouldn’t use his Milk Bottle in a fight! That would be giving his opponent the best chance to attack him! Doing so would mean there was a period of time when he would be interrupted. That period of interruption could be fatal against a strong opponent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng couldn’t take it anymore. He was infuriated by how Huo Yuhao seemed so contemptuous of him!</span></p>
