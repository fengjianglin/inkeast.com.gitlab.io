In the next moment, a wave of suction force appeared and dragged his body into the room.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s gaze turned lifeless as he walked into the room. The room was around 10 square meters large. Countless rhizomes hung from the ceiling and covered the entire four walls, as well as the floor. He wouldn’t be so shocked if they were just stems. He was shocked because these rhizomes were entirely yellowish-golden. The strong aura of life came from these rhizomes.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the center of this room, there was a circular mat that subtly shone with a golden radiance. The strong aura of light spread out from above it.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The concentration of the light element was so great that it almost assumed liquid form.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong only felt that his heart had been cleansed. He even had the same feeling he had experienced when he had first bathed in the golden light before he came to the Sea God’s Pavilion. He understood that the golden light he was being bathed in belonged to the power of the golden tree! But he didn’t know who guided it.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t just a stroke of luck, but fortune. Wang Dong was also very intelligent. He walked forward rapidly and sat cross-legged on the mat.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strong wave of light aura suddenly soared up from underneath him. His entire body instantly turned a smooth gold. His soul power circulated, and he didn’t even need to do anything before he entered meditation. He wasn’t absorbing the light element now, but the light element was surging into his body.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"> </span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His head became unprecedentedly clear. The light element flowed naturally, and his soul power circulated at high speed. His spirit was flushed with vigor, and all types of thoughts now seemed very clear in his mind. Different types of sentiments also arose. In just a matter of breaths, he entered the deep meditative state that he once admired Huo Yuhao for.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was different from an ordinary meditative state. His mind was working at great speed now, and he began to master the various abilities and experiences that he had as he understood them.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wang Dong.” A gentle voice rang in Wang Dong’s heart just as he was experiencing the brilliance of this deep meditative state. The sudden appearance of this voice caused his senses to be jolted.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Mu?” Wang Dong thought to himself.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Continue to meditate without messing up your thoughts. Listen to me, you just need more time to comprehend things. Your twin martial souls are the Radiant Butterfly Goddess and the Clear Sky Hammer. They’re two outstanding martial souls. The former is more of an element-type, while the latter is more of a strength-type. Both martial souls are suitable to be your main martial soul. It seems like you chose the former. You should have learned in the external courtyard that different martial souls will lead to different results when mastered in different environments. It’s more beneficial to a soul master if he cultivates in an environment most suited to his martial soul.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you are in the Sea God’s Pavilion Underground World. There are 108 rooms here, and they cover almost all the environments suited for all types of martial souls. Every inner courtyard disciple has a chance to undergo deep meditation here. Although the few of you aren’t inner courtyard disciples yet, I’ve granted permission for the few of you to undergo deep meditation here beforehand on account of your contributions to the academy, sufficient experience in the tournament and your gifts of twin martial souls. Your efforts will reap greater rewards here, and this experience will be be very valuable to your future cultivation. But it’s not just about your cultivation here. More importantly, you have to find your path here.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was jolted once again as he heard Elder Mu’s words. He seemed to understand some things.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Mu said, “Every soul master has a path he needs to take. Assault, agility, control, auxiliary – these are only the shallowest things. Achieving more requires one to find his path accurately and precisely. No one can tell you how to walk this path. You can only discover it for yourself. For individuals with twin martial souls like yourself, it’s even more important to discover your own path. Never hesitate, or doubt the path you chose. Try your best to finish walking that path. You’ll succeed no matter what the path is if you can do this.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Mu’s guidance stopped here, and his voice also disappeared completely. In the other 2 rooms, Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao also heard the same things.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was in a special room. There were no rhizomes in this room. There was only a huge bell. Firstly, Xiao Xiao felt a heaviness that almost suffocated her. When she made an effort to sit down on the mat, she only heard a loud boom. Everything around her disappeared, and the only thought in her head was that she was trapped in a bell.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in the most special room. When he entered, it was pitch-black. The entire room was silent.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He subconsciously wanted to unleash his martial soul when he entered the room. With his Spirit Eyes and Purple Demon Eyes, he could see everything clearly even if there wasn’t any light.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he suddenly felt a great distortion in the space where he was standing at this moment. It was as if the entire area around him had twisted tremendously, and his mind seemed to enter a trance.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He staggered forward two steps, and countless yellow spots lit up around him. It was as if many pairs of eyes were staring at him. A quiet chamber that was also 10 square meters in size also lit up.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was this?</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao looked at what was on the walls around him, he was shocked. He wanted to escape immediately. But he soon found out to his horror that he couldn’t locate the door. Even though he unleashed his Spirit Eyes and used his Spiritual Detection to search for the door, he still couldn’t find it.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The same type of bone was hung on the four walls and the ceiling. This bone didn’t belong to a human, but was instead a triangular skull that was. There was a huge gap for the eyes, and the bottom of the skull was sharp. The yellow lights were shining from the eye sockets, which appeared to be balls of flames.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah.” Huo Yuhao groaned. His body shook, and he almost fell to the ground. He only felt like a huge cage formed by immense spiritual power was trapping him within, and it was even caving in towards him.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did not just feel tormented. He was even fearful. His Spiritual Sea also started to writhe tremendously, as if it was about to be torn apart by the frightening spiritual power outside.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Skydream Iceworm, Ice Empress and Electrolux didn’t react at this point. He was the only one bearing all this.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was Huo Yuhao before the tournament, he wouldn’t have been able to do anything except panic. His Spiritual Sea would even be on the brink of collapse. But torment and pain allowed one to grow. Furthermore, he was even nourished by the Life Gold before. </span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After panicking momentarily, he calmed himself down. He resisted the strong spiritual power and sat down on the mat in the room. He gathered his mind and focused so that he could calm down. He also controlled his own spiritual power and skin to act as defensive barriers. He laid layers and layers of spiritual barriers around and on himself to resist the violation of the external spiritual power.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Spiritual Sea had become extremely resilient after he had trained it for so long. He quickly calmed down and stabilized his condition. The external spiritual power also became less intense at the same time.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Mu’s voice resonated at this moment.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao, tell me: what is spiritual power?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was different from both Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao in that he was already used to spiritual interaction. He immediately used his Spiritual Sea to reveal his answer.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spiritual power is will.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Mu said, “That’s right, spiritual power is will. And the key to training one’s spiritual power is through resistance and pressure. Your spiritual power is much stronger than I had imagined. There’s no other way to describe it other than the fact that you have an unusual gift. Since you have twin martial souls and the Ultimate Ice as one of them, can you tell me why you didn’t choose the Ultimate Ice to be your main martial soul, but instead chose your Spirit Eyes?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “That’s because the Ice Jade Scorpion is too powerful. Its powers can only be fully unleashed when the soul rings on it are stronger. That’s why I hope to use the Spirit Eyes to accumulate sufficient strength, and ensure that the soul rings on the Ice Jade Scorpion are at least ten thousand years and above.”</span></p>
