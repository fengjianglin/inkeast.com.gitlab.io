 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After all, my Bone Dragon King is not a real dragon. It cannot use the toughness of a dragon’s body to negate the detrimental effects brought by its usage of different elements. Hence, it always requires time to make some adjustments to its body before releasing any elemental ability. Even though it has consumed so many spirits from the soul beasts I have fed it, it still needs this annoying warm-up phase. It can only perform at its greatest potential afterward. My Bone Dragon King might have only inherited the fire-type and wind-type elements from the Silver Dragon King, but its mastery of the two elements is almost perfect. Hence, what you will be facing up next is the frightening combination of fire and wind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing his sentence, the light around Zhongli Wu’s body suddenly intensified as the Bone Dragon King beneath him regained its black color The sky above everyone suddenly turned both green and red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, fiery meteors started to appear in the sky. However, they were all blue this time round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gusts of green wind started to appear once more. It was well understood by everyone present that the wind would help that enhance the power of the fire! At the next instant, the blue fiery meteors were like cannon shells which sped straight towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The frightening aura released by the meteor shower created a burning smell in the air. A scary suffocating atmosphere enveloped the entire area fifty kilometers from their battleground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan, who had managed to maintain his composure all this while, suddenly revealed a startled expression. The aura Zhongli Wu was radiating right now was actually on par with his!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even an Ultimate Douluo like him would have to be extremely focused and careful when handling the attack Zhongli Wu had just released. In fact, he might even have to unleash his martial soul true body. Zhongli Wu’s power had exceeded Elder Xuan’s estimation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was obviously not an Ultimate Douluo yet. However, he was at least a Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo. The most frightening thing was how he was able to elevate his power to that of an Ultimate Douluo with his peculiar beast spirit. No wonder he was one of the greatest evil soul masters in this continent. If he were to successfully become an Ultimate Douluo in the future, his abilities would definitely be a lot stronger than those of the Death God Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How was Huo Yuhao going to handle an attack which even an Ultimate Douluo had to fear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi had already stood up after seeing Zhongli Wu’s attack. She was clenching her fists as she gazed intently at the sky. Of course, she would not stand up in joy because Zhongli Wu had gained the upper hand. Instead, she only stood up because she was worried about the man who was about to be caught between fire and wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Can he really survive a blow like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint light flickered as Huo Yuhao revealed a cold expression on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s finally here! This is what Zhongli Wu is truly capable of. In that case, it’s also time for him to see what I’m capable of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint streak of icy blue light was released from Huo Yuhao’s body as it shot straight up into the sky. The fiery atmosphere in the sky was instantly weakened. An insane soul power fluctuation swept towards the fire and wind which were swarming towards Huo Yuhao as Zhongli Wu’s attack paused for a short while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blue pillar of light more than ten meters in diameter shot straight into the sky and illuminated the sky above the fiery clouds. The blue moon that was behind Huo Yuhao became even more radiant. This also resulted in his Icy War God’s Armor radiating a more intense blue light. His frightening Ultimate Ice was actually concentrating on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was not the only person who had not gone all-out in the previous moments. Huo Yuhao had also not used his full power to fend off the attacks launched at him by Zhongli Wu. Now, their battle had only just begun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A short dagger suddenly appeared in Huo Yuhao’s hand. After noticing the appearance of the dagger, Zhongli Wu’s pupils contracted slightly. This was obviously one of the items Huo Yuhao had chosen to bet with. He had referred to it as a godly weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, Zhongli Wu was not particularly interested in this dagger. After all, a powerful weapon which was full of Ultimate Ice power was not of much use for him. However, no one would ever worry about having too many precious items. It would still be a good thing for him if he were actually able to get his hands on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhongli Wu was genuinely interested to see how Huo Yuhao would use this dagger to defend himself against his wind-infused fiery meteor shower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gave him the answer he wanted very soon. Wielding the short dagger with his right hand, Huo Yuhao slashed it forward with a gentle and moderately fast movement. A streak of blue dagger light was immediately emitted as light was projected forward close to ten meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By then, the blue meteors were approaching Huo Yuhao. However, they immediately vanished upon coming into contact with the flash of light released by the dagger. They did not even leave a single trace of smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao started to increase the speed of his slashing motion. He flitted across the sky like a gust of wind with nimble footsteps as the blue pillar of light followed wherever he went. The pillar was essentially functioning like a vacuum chamber, which ensured that the violent air current in the sky would not restrict his movements. He was as quick as lightning. With every slash he made, a meteor would vanish. The people around him were starting to notice how Huo Yuhao was actually moving so fast that the meteors were unable to catch up with him. Even though Zhongli Wu had used a lot more soul power to release such an overwhelming attack, its effects could not be compared with Huo Yuhao’s, as only a small portion of his meteors would be able to come into contact with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was starting to find a rhythm to this as he continually used the dagger in his hand to handle the meteors that were coming his way. No matter how the meteors tried to smash him, surround him, or encircle him, they just could not hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one were to say that Zhongli Wu had held the upper hand throughout the course of the battle so far, then it would be apt to say that Huo Yuhao had managed to gain absolute control within the advantage that Zhongli Wu had seemingly created.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sigh of the Frozen Goddess, Morning Dew Dagger! Huo Yuhao had finally found the perfect stage to showcase the true power of the dagger. Its powerful blade light allowed it to slice through any flame which lay before it. With the help of his Icy War God’s Armor and the Morning Dew Dagger, Huo Yuhao was able to survive an onslaught which would even threaten the life of an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has he been withholding his power all this time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s jaw dropped as he stared at Huo Yuhao, who was flitting across the sky. He finally understood why Huo Yuhao dared to challenge Zhongli Wu, even after defeating four Transcendent Douluo. Huo Yuhao was a lot more powerful than what he had thought!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Transcendent Douluo? A Transcendent Douluo with an Ultimate strength martial soul?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was probably not just that. Even though Huo Yuhao’s equipment played an important role, they would never have been able to exhibit their power without his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao felt as though the Morning Dew Dagger had become an extension of his body. Every simple action he made was able to harness the dagger’s brilliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wherever the flash of light radiated by the dagger landed, the ice-type element in the air would immediately congregate. There was always a layer of icy mist surrounding the blade of the dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Morning Dew Dagger. The Morning Dew Dagger which was encrusted with the gem of the Frozen Goddess. This was a real godly weapon! Huo Yuhao knew that no one—including Zhongli Wu and Ju Zi—had believed him when he had revealed how the Morning Dew Dagger was a godly weapon. This was because everyone in the world of soul masters believed that the strongest weapon ought to be a soul tool. In their eyes, a godly weapon was a Class 9 soul tool. However, it was apparent that the Morning Dew Dagger was not just any soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a culmination of power and energy that did not exist in their world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile formed on Huo Yuhao’s face. He had never felt the need to try to convince others to believe him. He knew he just had to show it to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind-infused fiery meteor shower lasted for a couple of minutes. When the last meteor was finally destroyed by the Morning Dew Dagger, the sky returned to its normal state. Even the Bone Dragon King returned to its original black color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu stared at Huo Yuhao, who was wielding the dagger in a composed manner, as he nodded gently. “Now I finally believe that dagger is a godly weapon. There’s no way you could have blocked my attack without it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao did not try to deny it as he nodded gently. “If you hadn’t lived for a hundred years more than me, you would not have been qualified to stand before me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing how Zhongli Wu was trying to poke at the fact that he had relied on a godly weapon, Huo Yuhao could not help but make fun of the pointless extra hundred years Zhongli Wu had lived. Even after cultivating for an additional hundred years, they were still somewhat on par.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu released a cold grunt as he raised the staff in his hand once again. The Bone Dragon King beneath him repeated the same action of tilting its head upwards. Its gigantic wings started to flap in a vigorous manner as Zhongli Wu’s body started to grow bigger at an incredibly fast rate. The image which had been suspended behind his back all this while was gradually fusing with his body. His seventh soul ring, which was red, started to radiate an intense light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time that Huo Yuhao was going to see Zhongli Wu unleash a soul skill. Was he about to use his martial soul true body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aren’t all of his soul skills of the strengthening kind? Then, what use does his martial soul true body have? Would it allow him to fuse with the Bone Dragon King?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao was not sure what Zhongli Wu was up to, he was not overly concerned. After all, this battle was meant to be the biggest test for his abilities. The stronger the enemy, the better it was for him, as he would only learn more and become stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s worries were non-existent in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. He had never thought that he would actually be killed by Zhongli Wu. This was the confidence that belonged to a soul master who possessed a pair of Yin Yang Complement soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After becoming ten meters tall, Zhongli Wu’s body stopped growing. Right now, his entire body was enshrouded by darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the hundred meter or thousand meter-tall martial soul true body of a Titled Douluo, his ten meter-tall martial soul true body did not seem very impressive. However, Huo Yuhao was visibly startled—even though no one could see his facial expression under his visor—after Zhongli Wu’s martial soul true body was complete.</span></p>

His staff had evolved into a sickle after he had grown to his ten meter size. The blade of the sickle was about ten meters long. Hence, it looked strangely disproportionate for a ten meter-tall Zhongli Wu to wield a ten meter-long sickle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after his transformation, an indescribable pressure started to exert itself on Huo Yuhao from all directions. The overwhelming, formless pressure made Huo Yuhao feel as though his spirit was about to be squeezed out from his body.</span></p>
