 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden light erupted from Huo Yuhao’s eyes. Tang Wutong could vividly feel through Huo Yuhao’s shared Spiritual Detection that his spiritual power had locked onto a piece of floating ice on the ocean’s surface directly beneath them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao clenched his left fist in the next moment as that piece of floating ice exploded into a million pieces with a loud boom, and tremendous explosive forces carried air waves and seawater into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were already around three hundred meters from the ocean’s surface with their incredibly high speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That air resistance pushed upwards as Tang Wutong’s wings caught the wind and slowed them down. That air resistance dispelled their speedy plummet before they fell towards the ocean’s surface once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Falling from three hundred meters was not a big deal for formidable individuals as powerful as they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong frowned as her eyes widened into a glare at the herd of Sea Devilwalruses. An intense aura appeared around her as she raised her right hand, and her Golden Dragon Spear appeared in her grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no wonder that she was angry. They were just flying forward, minding their own business, and had no intention to provoke those walruses at all. Yet, these Sea Devilwalruses had suddenly attacked them, and that attack could have been fatal. If they didn’t have a suitable response, falling from such an altitude would undoubtedly be fatal, because there were so many icebergs beneath them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The twelve Sea Devilwalruses who were blowing the golden conch shells were slightly taken aback as they watched the two of them descend peacefully. The leader howled into the sky, and several hundred walruses split into two teams to outflank Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cold light flickered in Tang Wutong’s eyes as murderousness permeated the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong no longer attacked and killed soul beasts ever since they had fused with their spirits. However, they couldn’t just sit back and wait to die if soul beasts provoked and attacked them instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait, Wutong.” Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong glanced at him, and her murderous aura immediately dissipated. Even though she was a little arrogant and stubborn at times, and even though she was competitive when she fought against Huo Yuhao, he was always the one making decisions when they were outside. She had to give her man sufficient respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at the largest Sea Devilwalrus who was in the lead, and he passed a message with his spiritual power. “Why are you ambushing us? We harbor no ill intentions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All humans deserve to die!” That Sea Devilwalrus only had ten thousand years of cultivation, and it was clear that it didn’t have the ability to speak. However, it didn’t have any problem conversing through its consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shared its response with Tang Wutong through Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned and replied, “Not all humans deserve to die. We have no ill intentions in our journey into the Ice Sea. We only wish to look for the Mermaids. You have attacked us so rashly. Aren’t you afraid of bringing disaster to your tribe?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The largest walrus howled furiously. It waved the golden conch in its front limb strongly as that deep humming sound could be heard once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of you have to die! You dare to come here to find the Mermaids. All of you must die for coming into the Ice Sea!” The walrus’ speech was a little incoherent, but Huo Yuhao could clearly sense the intense hostility coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t here to be enemies with the aquatic soul beasts. On the contrary, he was hoping that he could establish a relationship with the aquatic soul beasts like the one he had with the Great Star Dou Forest. If that was possible, then humans would have many more choices for Spirits. More soul masters would then choose Spirits, and they wouldn’t have to kill soul beasts for soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he suppressed the anger in his heart as he lowered his voice and said, “Don’t make this mistake. I don’t wish to kill or harm your tribesmen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sea Devilwalruses had formed a circle around them in this moment, and they were moving toward Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong swiftly. Several walruses flickered with blue light as they blasted ice bullets at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These ice bullets were icy-blue, and there were very evident and intense soul power undulations as they zipped across the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those were Ice Explosion Shells! That was one of the Sea Devilwarlrus’ signature soul skills, and also considered their innate talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head gently when he realized that persuading them was futile. He increased his Spiritual Detection’s range as he encompassed all the walruses within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something that astonished all the walruses happened immediately afterwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Explosion Shells that were flying toward Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong froze at the same time, and every single one detonated in the sky as they exploded into countless ice particles in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tiny particles of ice whooshed through the air, and they actually condensed into snowflakes as they started to dance as a blizzard erupted from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This blizzard came all too suddenly and too vigorously. The twelve Sea Devilwalruses hadn’t even reacted as the blizzard swept their tribesmen into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several hundred walruses danced and spun around in the sky, and they all screamed and hollered in shock and panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The twelve leading walruses were stunned. They could almost see their tribesmen being mutilated and eviscerated in the blizzard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their enemy was so powerful. This was something they hadn’t expected at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong turned her head and glanced at Huo Yuhao. She could see that his eighth soul ring was glowing. Huo Yuhao was using the Ice Bear’s Blizzard. He wasn’t using his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. He chose to use Blizzard instead because Blizzard was more explosive. However, its temperature wasn’t as low as his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The walruses which had surrounded and attacked them were all instantly swept away. Furthermore, the blizzard was starting to move towards the twelve leading walruses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those twelve walruses were completely taken aback. This was a frightening attack that was entirely like a cosmological phenomenon, and they couldn’t even begin to think of resisting it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The walruses began to howl furiously after their momentary shock, and they blasted bullets of ice at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong again and again. However, these bullets detonated by themselves not long after they were fired, and they couldn’t come close to Huo Yuhao or Tang Wutong at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blizzard had arrived, and every single one of those twelve walruses lost all hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in the next moment, they realized to their surprise that the blizzard didn’t attack them at all when it arrived. The walruses hadn’t even reacted when the blizzard began to settle down, and Sea Devilwalruses drifted down from the sky on snowflakes one after another as they landed stably next to them. Every single walrus was still in fear and panic, but they weren’t hurt at all as they landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t a single missing walrus when they reappeared next to their leaders as the blizzard completely disappeared, like they hadn’t charged out to surround and attack Huo Yuhao or Tang Wutong at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The walrus leaders’ expressions changed completely. They all had at least ten thousand years of cultivation, and they already possessed a certain level of intelligence. They could naturally tell how difficult what Huo Yuhao had just done was. Controlling a soul skill to such an extent was something that they couldn’t even begin to imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though using a blizzard to sweep all the walruses into the air was also difficult, it could be done with sufficient strength. The blizzard could even kill every single one of those walruses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, controlling the entire herd to fall from the sky and land back on the ground without being hurt at all wasn’t easy. Huo Yuhao had to be precise, down to every single walrus! A capacity for control like that far exceeded their imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This human is so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The leading walruses put down the golden conch shells in their hands at the same time, and no longer harbored any thoughts to resist Huo Yuhao. Their opponent could have annihilated their entire tribe if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong along. They didn’t go any closer to the herd, and instead, Huo Yuhao passed a message with his consciousness to the largest walrus. “Now do you understand that we harbor no ill intentions? If we were hostile, we could completely annihilate your herd.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The walrus leader roared. “The Mermaids have issued a prohibition. All humans who enter the Ice Sea are enemies, and they have to be annihilated. Even if you let us go, there will be other aquatic soul beasts who will deal with you.” This was the reply from the leader of the walruses, but he had already put down the golden conch in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at the golden conch curiously and asked, “What is that? Why did it make us fall from the sky?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sacred Conch, seals the sky!” The Sea Devilwalrus didn’t hide anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong exchanged a glance, and they could see the seriousness in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the greatest reasons why they were confident of venturing into the Ice Sea was because they could fly. Most aquatic soul beasts couldn’t fly, and even if they could, these soul beasts couldn’t compete with Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong in terms of flight speed. That meant they could retreat whenever they wanted to. Sea Devilwalruses were evidently not considered extremely formidable among aquatic soul beasts, but they were equipped with those Sacred Conch Shells, which could lock down the sky. This meant that aquatic soul beasts had to have grasped and developed many similar methods and measures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They couldn’t fight in the sky, but they could force humans or soul beasts flying through the air to drop down. It was no wonder there weren’t any flying-type soul beasts in the air above this vast ocean space. Perhaps they had all gone extinct in the fight against the aquatic soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Farewell.” Huo Yuhao knew that there wasn’t much reason to discuss anything with these walruses. However, their previous conflict wasn’t entirely meaningless. First, they had discovered that the aquatic soul beasts had some measures to lock down the sky. Secondly, they found out about the Mermaids’ resentment towards humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They flew into the sky once more, but were now flying at a conspicuously lower altitude. After all, they would be at a great disadvantage if they fell after those measures that locked down the sky were used. They would be at a greater disadvantage the higher they flew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They maintained an altitude of five hundred meters above the ocean’s surface. They wouldn’t be hurt in any way if they fell from that height. Of course, the closer they were to the ocean’s surface, the more trouble they could run into.</span></p>
