 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His soul core was stable enough. It was only fiercely resisting as it was provoked. However, it didn’t waver at all. This was a blessing among all the misfortunes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Ya was already doing her best to aid Huo Yuhao. Her voice was already hoarse from singing, but she still continued. Because of her help, Huo Yuhao was completely focused on his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t imagine what it would be like if he tried this method of cultivation before he fused with Li Ya. However, he was certain that he wouldn’t have been able to last until this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bright light flashed from his body. The Ultimate Ice soul power released by the Ice Empress was strong and prosperous. Every time, she managed to block out most of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t just the strength of Ultimate Ice anymore. There was also the strength of the Ice Empress’ spiritual origin. It was only through supplementing her spiritual power that she could successfully resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul power around the Snow Empress’ ice crystals was continuously poured out. At this moment, she seemed to neglect the fact that Huo Yuhao could possibly suffer from immense pain. She was completely doing her own thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King was also almost at his limit. He was protecting Huo Yuhao’s passageways, bones and internal organs. However, the two forces that revolved in different directions were still intensely attacking Huo Yuhao’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power could still hang on, but his body was on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his body had been enhanced by the Life Gold, and he possessed extraordinarily immense life energy, the violent forces in his body were eventually too much for a human body to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His passageways were about to tear, and his internal organs were also on the brink of failure as they were squeezed and distorted. However, Huo Yuhao couldn’t do anything else except hold on. Blood was already starting to come out of his mouth. This was a sign of his capillaries rupturing. If this continued, his body would be torn apart by the forces it was attempting to contain, and his spiritual soul core would blow apart as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress’ ice crystals shone a little, just as she was about to make a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao’s dantian lit up. Following this, a layer of golden light quickly surged out from his dantian and rapidly spread throughout his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was spiritual power that was unleashed from his spiritual core or the Ultimate Ice power around his chest, they couldn’t prevent this golden force from appearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because this golden force was completely fused into Huo Yuhao’s blood. In just a few breaths, his passageways had turned completely golden. Even his blood and internal organs turned golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From outside, Huo Yuhao was just like a golden statue, shining brightly with golden light. Furthermore, there was a dense layer of scales on his skin. These scales were also pure gold. They gradually expanded until they covered his entire body. Only his face maintained a human appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were dragon scales! Yes, that’s right, they were dragon scales. The scales of a Holy Radiant Dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The excruciating pain in his body was alleviated slightly. Huo Yuhao was also very astonished. He didn’t know where this had come from. The golden invasion caused his passageways, bones and internal organs to become bigger and bigger. In addition, it was even directly fusing with his body and becoming a part of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a very familiar aura of light. However, it neither came from Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon nor the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. Instead…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Radiant Holy Dragon. Yes! This is clearly the strength of a Radiant Holy Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, it’s not like a Radiant Holy Dragon that eldest senior can turn into. Its strength is much purer and denser than eldest senior. Don’t tell me this is teacher’s strength? Is that even possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek Academy, Sea God’s Island, Sea God’s Pavilion. The Golden Tree!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentle, golden light shone from the Golden Tree. Everyone could sense the gentle undulations that came from the golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the elders walked out from Sea God’s Island. They came in front of the Golden Tree, including Xian Lin’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A ball of golden light rose from the Golden Tree, and drifted above the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s…” Elder Song focused her gaze. Although she couldn’t see what was inside the ball of golden light, she could sense the familiar aura that came from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ball of golden light stopped in the air, and seemed to greet all the elders. Following this, it turned into a beam of flowing light, and flew towards the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan silently stood guard outside Huo Yuhao’s laboratory. When Huo Yuhao’s golden strength was invoked, Elder Xuan immediately sensed it from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a strong power of light. However, since when did Yuhao possess such strong power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally couldn’t give him an answer. Elder Xuan only revealed an unsure look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a benevolent aura swept by. Golden light shone, and a projection appeared out of thin air in front of Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Mu?” Elder Xuan jumped up almost instantly, and was shocked as he looked at the projection in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu smiled at Elder Xuan and nodded at him. After this, he drifted in front of him and gently patted his shoulder. A thought was also transmitted into Elder Xuan’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shrek will depend on you in the future. Little Xuan, take care.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Elder Xuan could say anything, the golden projection that Elder Mu had turned into flew past him and through the metal door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s body shook tremendously. Following this, an ominous feeling arose. He couldn’t help but scream, “Elder Mu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He quickly turned around. As he looked at the huge steel door behind him, he couldn’t control his emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden projection that Elder Mu had turned into silently appeared in the laboratory, in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He revealed a peaceful look on his face as he looked at Huo Yuhao struggling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kid, you’ve chosen a very tough path to embark on. However, what you’ve done is correct, whether it’s for Shrek or the three empires. It’s almost impossible for a human to cultivate using the Yin Yang Complement. I shall give you a hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden light flashed, and Elder Mu re-transformed into a ball of golden light, and charged directly into Huo Yuhao’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentleness and warmth spread throughout Huo Yuhao’s body. He was in torment and pain earlier, but it was very soothing right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief and almost fainted as he instantaneously relaxed. However, that warm and genial strength immediately engulfed his spiritual power and kept him in his current state. His spiritual power immediately calmed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher, it’s really you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao saw Elder Mu in his spiritual sea, he immediately became very emotional. His spiritual power took form and turned into a projection of him. This projection kowtowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu smiled as he looked at his closed-door disciple. He smiled and let Huo Yuhao kowtow. After this, he drifted forward and arrived in front of him. He caressed his head gently. “Kid, come here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stood up and looked at Elder Mu. His spiritual entity couldn’t cry, but feelings of happiness spread from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The feeling of seeing a loved one when one was in extreme pain was indescribable. Huo Yuhao felt protected with Elder Mu around!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher…” Huo Yuhao sobbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu smiled and said, “Don’t be like a kid anymore. Yuhao, you’ve grown up. You’ve done great. You’ve done much better than I expected. As your teacher, I’m proud of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although I’ve not been by your side all these years, I’ve heard of most of the things that have happened to you from Little Xuan. I also personally observed you myself. You’ve done really well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher.” Huo Yuhao called once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu said, “This time, you chose the Yin Yang Complement to cultivate. Although it’s reckless, it isn’t wrong to some extent. Shrek needs someone who is powerful enough to change situations. Such a person hasn’t appeared for years. Ten thousand years ago, our ancestor Tang San used his abilities to change situations, building Shrek’s foundation. Ten thousand years later, I believe you have that potential too.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu nodded and said, “Xiaoyao should be the one who helped you consume it. You should have seen him once before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you talking about the Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao?” Huo Yuhao was astonished as he looked at Elder Mu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu replied, “Yes! I was the one who asked him to give you the dragon pill when the time was right.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu shook his head and answered, “Xiaoyao isn’t an evil soul master. He’s a poor soul. He’s trapped by love. I had no choice but to get out of it then, but he’s been trapped. Because of some wrongdoings he committed in the past, he chose to atone for them. That’s why things are like this. However, he’s still a soul master from the three empires. Before I died, I met him, passed the dragon pill to him, and implored him to give it to you when the time was right. At the same time, I also asked him to protect you if you were in danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Protect me?” Huo Yuhao could still clearly remember the pain from being stabbed so many times!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Mu smiled and nodded. He said, “If he wanted to kill you, you would have already died. If not for the fact that he is secretly protecting you, I’m afraid that the Holy Ghost Church wouldn’t be dealing with you this way. You’ll understand in the future. As for the dragon pill…”</span></p>
