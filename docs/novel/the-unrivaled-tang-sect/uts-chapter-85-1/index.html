 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 85.1: Twin Mistresses of Fire and Ice, Thousandstrike Lance</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had spent more than a year cultivating with his blood, sweat and tears. In addition to Skydream Iceworm’s guidance, he was getting more and more proficient in controlling his spiritual power. Even though he still didn’t have a spiritual sea that was sufficiently large enough, it was comparatively elaborate enough under his subtle control over his spiritual power.</p>
 <p>As a result of that, it appeared as though his entrance into the spiritual sea in Wang Dong’s body was exceptionally gentle when he did so from his temple.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong felt a burst of warmth from his temple. Following which, he seemed to be in a slightly dazed state, as though everything wasn’t real anymore. Immediately after that, he strongly felt as though someone was openly spying on him.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power entered Wang Dong’s spiritual sea without a hitch. The first thing he saw was a faint golden field, nothing too different compared to his spiritual sea. The only difference was that Wang Dong’s spiritual power was much weaker than his own.</p>
 <p><em>I succeeded!</em> Huo Yuhao was elated. For a connection between spiritual seas to work, both parties had to be extremely in sync. If one were to forcefully enter another’s spiritual sea, it was very likely to cause damage to either parties’ soul sea. At the very least, the connection happening at this moment proved the absolute trust Wang Dong had in him.</p>
 <p>The spiritual sea could be said to be the most mysterious place in the human body. Even till today, no one had really been able to grasp the mysteries of the spiritual sea. As a result of that, Huo Yuhao was exceptionally careful as started delving into the depths of Wang Dong’s spiritual sea.</p>
 <p>But at this very moment, an indescribably terrifying aura suddenly surged out of Wang Dong’s spiritual sea.</p>
 <p>That incomparably imposing aura was like a mountain. When faced with such terrifying might, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was as small as a drop in the ocean.</p>
 <p>“Run!” The Skydream Iceworm’s startled voice suddenly rang out in Huo Yuhao’s spiritual world. A massive suction force came from behind. Right before that terrifyingly formidable power came in contact with him, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power had already been completely stripped back to his original body.</p>
 <p>Even though that was the case, Huo Yuhao still felt that the sight before his eyes had turned into a golden world. After that, his whole body flew backwards in a completely uncontrollable manner, viciously striking the wall. It was as though he’d been branded there for a good couple of seconds. Only after that did he slowly slide down while his own spiritual sea started vibrating violently.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm barely kept Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea intact as it released its sealed, powerful spiritual power. Even so, Huo Yuhao was unable to regain his senses for a long time. His face was completely pale as he sat listlessly on the ground.</p>
 <p>His mind drew a blank. After a good ten or so seconds passed, Huo Yuhao gradually regained consciousness, and the scene before his eyes was plain once more.</p>
 <p>He clearly saw Wang Dong standing there with his eyes still closed as his body slowly absorbed a light golden light. He was emitting a feeling of divinity.</p>
 <p><em>W-what’s going on?</em> Huo Yuhao was in a state of shock when he felt a wet puddle on his back. It was no surprise he was afraid. Just a moment ago, he had clearly felt as though his spiritual world was about to be completely destroyed if the Skydream Iceworm hadn’t pulled his spiritual power back into his spiritual sea!</p>
 <p>That power was really too terrifying, to the point where the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress were a little sluggish. They were rendered temporarily unable to answer Huo Yuhao’s question. Just what exactly was hidden in Wang Dong’s spiritual sea that had stunned the two powerhouses in his mind?</p>
 <p>“Elder Electrolux, what exactly is that power? How can it be so powerful?” Huo Yuhao asked, feeling horrified.</p>
 <p>“Since the process was too brief, I can’t determine what it is for sure either. I could only faintly feel that there’s something sealed within his body. This seal is extremely powerful, so unimaginably powerful. Even when I was at my strongest in my previous life, I’m afraid I couldn’t even compare to this seal. This seal seems to be sealing something on Wang Dong’s body, or putting it another way, something in his consciousness. But at the same time, it’s also protecting his spiritual sea so that it doesn’t corrode. In any case, you shouldn’t try it again. Just a step later, and your body and soul would’ve been obliterated. Thankfully, the big worm’s sensitive to spiritual power, and was able to save you in time,” Electrolux spoke with a heavy tone.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to try again. His lapels were completely drenched from the back. He never would’ve thought that the outcome would be like this. This was just as Elder Electrolux said. He had almost gone to the dogs!</p>
 <p>“Elder Electrolux, would this situation cause harm to Wang Dong?” Huo Yuhao asked urgently.</p>
 <p>“No, it shouldn’t. This situation is actually very rare, but it’s not like something like this hasn’t appeared amongst humans before. There are a very few situations in the human world that will cause humans to have godlike traits, just like this one. To put it simply, a deity exists in your friend’s body,” Electrolux said.</p>
 <p>“Gods were nothing but illusions in the world I came from. Once one broke through that realm, they had to give up their corporeal body and everything they had. A deity expands itself all across the world and controls everything, yet controls nothing at the same time. This is main reason why people from my world weren’t willing to become gods. When gods appeared, their souls would spread across the world. If a new life graced the world when that happened, the newborn’s vitality might very well cause a shred of the deity’s soul to enter their body. This is very beneficial to humans because, it would endow that child with talents. Moreover, this deity wouldn’t affect the newborn’s body, and would gradually disappear as the human aged. To put it in other terms, it’s called luck.”</p>
 <p>“Those who possess deities in them are lucky individuals. Don’t you guys have that saying where lucky people don’t have any worries in life?”</p>
 <p>After hearing Electrolux’s explanation, Huo Yuhao gently exhaled. Everything was fine as long as Wang Dong was okay. Naturally, he wouldn’t try and pry into his spiritual sea anymore in the future. His experience from a moment ago was really too scary.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress didn’t give him any other explanation. After all was said and done, they were soul beasts, and their understanding of the human world wasn’t as profound as that of Electrolux. Moreover, the deity that was like a seal really didn’t harbor any ill intent towards Wang Dong. It only silently protected Wang Dong’s soul. As a result of that, their conclusive opinion was the same as Elder Electrolux’s, and they felt that everything would be fine as long as Huo Yuhao didn’t purposely go and stir up trouble for himself.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong seemed to have woken up at this moment. He slowly opened his eyes, and was taken aback when he saw Huo Yuhao collapsed on the ground. “Yuhao, what happened to you?” He quickly strode forward and lent Huo Yuhao an arm.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao smiled bitterly and said, “It’s nothing. I just pried into your spiritual sea just now, and it consumed too much of my spiritual power. That’s all. Your status is very normal, and there’s nothing wrong with you. I reckon it’s a psychological burden from when you cultivated your martial soul as a child. Don’t mind it too much. You don’t have to use soul tools if you don’t like them. You have me, after all. Come, let’s cultivate for awhile. I consumed quite a lot of my spiritual power just now, so you need to help me out. Are we going to stay here, or are we going over to your side?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong saw his pale face and quickly said, “Why torture yourself? We’ll stay here.” As he spoke, he helped Huo Yuhao to the bed. The two of them pressed their palms against the other’s, and the gentle fluctuations of soul power converged into Haodong Power, starting to circulate within their bodies. Only then did Huo Yuhao feel somewhat stronger than before.</p>
 <p>A thousand miles away...</p>
 <p>A massive castle built atop the peak of a mountain. The grey castle was filled with an archaic aura, making it seem as though it had reached the pinnacle of existence.</p>
 <p>In the castle, two middle-aged men were drinking wine in a spacious hall.</p>
 <p>They were extremely tall. They still exuded a majestic aura even as they sat there.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man sitting at the head of the table had long green hair draped over his impressively wide shoulders. His eyes were actually green too! As he closed and opened his eyes, there was an ineffably special sense of realism to his simple and unadorned eyes. It was as though they were faintly revealing the tyrannical aura that his body couldn’t suppress.</p>
 <p>White skintight garments enveloped his tall figure. He held a huge wine cup in his hands, letting fine amber wine enter his system.</p>
 <p>A middle-aged brawny man whose body wasn’t inferior to his sat in the seat next to the head of the table. This person had fine, short hair that resembled steel needles. He had a majestic appearance, with a chiseled, resolute face. His eyes were light brown, and shone faintly with a golden glow.</p>
 <p>These two people were only sitting there, but the feeling they exuded was an extremely majestic one. That strong aura definitely couldn’t be fully concealed even if they were to suppress it.</p>
 <p>These two men had originally been drinking wine when their bodies shook at the same time out of the blue. Soon, a look of terror appeared in their eyes. With a swoosh, they immediately stood up.</p>
 <p>At this moment, four bolts of lightning seemed to have suddenly filled the hall. Two of them were the color of jade, while the other two were light brown. The palace-like hall creaked, failing to withstand the sudden terrifying aura that had exploded out in the room.</p>
