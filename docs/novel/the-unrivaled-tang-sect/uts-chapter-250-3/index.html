<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">If someone could see the conditions of Huo Yuhao’s and Wang Qiu’er’s soul power, they would discover that both were dropping.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Qiu’er’s dropped because she was resisting the power of the domain, and Huo Yuhao’s dropped because he was releasing his power.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">In comparison, Huo Yuhao’s soul power depletion was less. After all, he was the one releasing his power. Furthermore, in an extremely cold environment, his soul power would recover faster than Wang Qiu’er’s. With the assistance of the Snow Lady, while his cultivation could not compare to Wang Qiu’er’s, his domain was more taxing on her than him.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">However, Huo Yuhao was still a five-ringed soul king, and Wang Qiu’er was a six-ringed soul emperor. If they both had Ultimate Strength martial souls, both of them would have similar soul power. However, if they continued to deplete their soul power like this, while Huo Yuhao’s depletion was slower, there was still a big difference between his soul power and Wang Qiu’er’s. No one knew who would be the first to run out of soul power.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao released his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice not just to deplete his opponent’s strength. It was also because he knew he could not go against Wang Qiu’er head-on. They had been through thick and thin together, and he didn’t even want to fight her from the start. The other reason was that he was searching for an opportunity as well. In the domain, Wang Qiu’er would be severely affected. This was equivalent to sealing her Golden Dragon’s Perception, while Huo Yuhao could sense her changes at any time.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao just needed Wang Qiu’er to slip up by a bit, and he would have a chance at defeating her. Hence, he waited.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Even if he did not do that, and he lost to Wang Qiu’er, she would be unable to fight another round because the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice would have depleted her soul power. As a control-type soul master, Huo Yuhao’s technique in this regard was considered exceptional.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Qiu’er appeared to have fallen into Huo Yuhao’s trap. She stood there, unmoving. Her entire body was like a statue, and her Golden Dragon Spear touched the surface of the ground silently without a single movement.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Under this condition, Wang Qiu’er appeared to be full of weaknesses. However, the more she appeared as such, the more Huo Yuhao dared not touch her.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Qiu’er was in no rush, much less Huo Yuhao. When he released his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, he also felt the change in his domain. He was not too familiar with it yet, and hence he could not use all its strength here. This was an excellent chance for him to sense its changes.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">They stood there, frozen. The spectators on both sides felt uncomfortable. The longer the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice lasted, the more the temperature dropped. After a while, the temperature in the entire arena dropped to -20 degrees Celsius. Icicles started to form on the structures of the soul-dueling arena. The other students were forced to use their soul power to resist the cold.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Xu Sanshi asked, “Is Yuhao fighting or dating!? Why is he not doing anything?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Bei Bei looked at him sideways and said, “Don’t talk nonsense.” As he said that, he motioned toward Wang Dong’er.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Xu Sanshi smirked, “Nothing, nothing, if Yuhao dares to dump you, Dong’er, I’ll… I’ll beat him until all his teeth drop to the ground.” He originally wanted to make a joke, but after Jiang Nannan, who was next to him, touched his waist, Xu Sanshi changed tactics immediately.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Dong’er snorted in laughter and said, “Well done, fourth sister. Look after him well so that he’ll stop spouting nonsense outside every day. Third brother is a Casanova, so you really should keep an eye on him.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Jiang Nannan snorted, “If he dares, let him run. If he runs, then he doesn’t need to come back anymore. I don’t care.”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Xu Sanshi immediately turned to her and smiled, saying, “Run? Where can I run to? No matter how fast I run, I can’t run away from my Nannan’s palm! If you tug me gently, I’ll come back to your side and accept whatever punishment you want to dish out, right?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Jiang Nannan said angrily, “Stop trying to use your glib tongue here, don’t stir shit between Yuhao and Dong’er, is that clear?”</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">“Yes!” Xu Sanshi agreed immediately.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Dong’er was not anxious, as she could understand what Huo Yuhao was thinking. He wanted to wear her down. However, she was still uncomfortable with the fact that Huo Yuhao was not fighting Wang Qiu’er directly. What kind of place did she have in his heart?</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Time-wise, Huo Yuhao had released his domain for quite some time. If he continued in this way, he may not be able to sustain it for long.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Dong’er understood Huo Yuhao best. Just when she made this prediction, Huo Yuhao, who was hidden in the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, started to move.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Like a snowflake, Huo Yuhao gradually approached Wang Qiu’er. In this domain, he was the master. Naturally, all signs of him would be covered by the domain.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao reached out with his palms. At this moment, they took on different colors. His left hand was icy-blue, and his right hand was icy-white. Lightly, they came down on Wang Qiu’er’s back.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">His soul power could not sustain the domain for long. Defeat and victory lay in this move. If he won, that would be ideal. If he lost, he would have depleted her soul power, and that was still good.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">When he saw Wang Qiu’er before him, Huo Yuhao paused momentarily. However, he was about to place his left hand on her back. He could see that his left hand had been completely covered by crystalline diamonds, which gave off a dark, mysterious blue light.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">However, at this moment, Wang Qiu’er moved.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">That was right. In the domain, Wang Qiu’er could not sense Huo Yuhao’s presence at all. This was the power of the domain. However, as someone with the Golden Dragon martial soul, how weak could her intuition be? In the face of threats, even if she could not sense anything, she could at least sense danger!</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear, which was in her right hand, pierced outward and shielded her entire back with light. As the spear released its light, a huge dragon roared, and an ear-shattering dragon roar rang out, causing the snowflakes around them to disappear.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">However, this was still within Huo Yuhao’s Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. His Spiritual Detection had always been centered on Wang Qiu’er. When she pulled out her spear, Huo Yuhao’s body had already moved.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">With his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, Huo Yuhao’s body flashed past. His entire body was like a snowflake as he dodged Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear. His left hand continued on its trajectory toward her, but he now aimed for her waist.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Instantly, Huo Yuhao’s speed was maximized. As Wang Qiu’er had wielded her Golden Dragon Spear with all her soul power, her reaction was slow by half a beat.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">With the coverage of his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao’s timing was impeccable.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">It hit! Huo Yuhao’s left hand tapped on Wang Qiu’er’s waist. An extreme chill was shot into her body, and the strength of the Ice Empress’ Pincer assaulted her. A powerful energy pushed Wang Qiu’er away the moment his hand made contact with her body. Not only that, but Ice Explosion also entered her body along with the Ultimate Ice. This caused the blood near Wang Qiu’er’s waist to freeze over.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Wang Qiu’er was powerful indeed. For normal people, the waist was a weak point. It was where humans got their strength from. Once the waist was hurt, one could soon be rendered immobile.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">However, Wang Qiu’er continued to stand there without moving. As Huo Yuhao’s palm made contact with her waist, he was actually unable to push her away. When his right hand touched her waist, he suddenly felt that it was as hard as steel. The Ice Explosion and Ultimate Ice had been delivered into her body, but his palm was already bouncing back. In that short time, Wang Qiu’er’s body spun around.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">The Golden Dragon Spear was gone! Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear had disappeared from her right hand. Her dazzling spear light had disappeared too.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Oh no! I’ve been tricked! Huo Yuhao instantly deduced that something was wrong.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">However, at this moment, his wealth of experience in battling came into play too. Had it been anyone else, they would have tried to create distance the moment they realized they had been tricked. However, Huo Yuhao understood that it was no longer possible for him to do so. He had personally witnessed Wang Qiu’er’s speed and strength in close-combat. Even with the cover of his domain, he could not run away. If he lost his momentum, he might not even be able to parry her next blow. One must realize that much of his soul power had been depleted.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Hence, Huo Yuhao did not run. His right hand came out as fast as a bolt of lightning as he tried to slap Wang Qiu’er’s shoulder. He had to hit where it would hurt the most. At the same time, he covered himself with the Ice Empress’ Armor. An intense emerald light flashed as he quickly released the Ice Empress’ Wrath immediately afterward.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">In terms of reaction speed, Huo Yuhao could be said to have done all this perfectly. He could also feel that his earlier palm strike had not been completely useless. The Ice Explosion had already been inserted. However, he hesitated, and did not let it explode at the first possible instant, as he did not know if she could handle the power of the Ice Explosion. If it really blew up in her waist, the damage would be extraordinary.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">Huo Yuhao did so much, but Wang Qiu’er just did a very simple action. From the moment she acted, her entire action was one smooth movement. She stabbed out with the Golden Dragon Spear in her right hand, and then she let go of immediately. The moment Huo Yuhao tapped her waist, her body froze momentarily. Then, she prepared to punch out.</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in">While resisting the domain, Wang Qiu’er released her first soul skill, Golden Dragon Body, to ensure Huo Yuhao took the bait. When she was hit, she did not reinforce her body. Only by doing this could she truly confuse Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</p>
