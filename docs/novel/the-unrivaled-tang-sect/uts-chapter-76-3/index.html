 <p><strong>Book 11: The Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 76.3: I come from Shrek, and from the Tang Sect!</strong></p>
 <p>Bei Bei looked carefully at the unconscious Huo Yuhao who was now lying on the sofa as he said, “Our junior brother is really talented. Back then, our moods had already changed. As we bathed in Shrek Academy’s glory, all our anxiety left us and we were only left with excitement. I told him that in the first battle under his command our objective wasn’t just to win but to win by a landslide. In order to accomplish that, our junior brother made a series of arrangements and brought about an outcome that was beyond our expectations. Even Yuhao must not have expected that our opponents would be that pitiful. The main reason for their loss was fear. Senior sister Ma was right, our Shrek Academy’s strongest weapon is our reputation.”</p>
 <p>“According to Yuhao’s original plan, all of us had had a role to play. He was supposed to start by using his Imitation Skill to scare our opponents and follow that up by hitting them with the fusion skill. Once their martial souls were sealed, the rest of us were supposed to rush in and immediately conclude the battle with our strongest soul skills. But who would have thought that those students from the Tian Ling Advanced Soul Academy were such cowards? When Yuhao used his Imitation Skill to simulate six hundred thousand year soul rings, they were so scared that they even forgot to dodge. Upon being being hit by Yuhao and Wang Dong’s fusion skill, they unexpectedly jumped down from the platform, which directly gave us the victory. I think they weren’t able to use even 10% of their real power and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that they didn’t fight at all. The first match of the tournament was such an easy victory.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan was mildly confused, were things really as simple as Bei Bei’s explanation? He was incredibly experienced regarding soul masters. At the time, he had also witnessed Yuhao release all those soul skills one after another and perform the martial soul fusion skill with Wang Dong. However, even if they were scared to death, those students from the Tian Ling Advanced Soul Academy should have been able to react when attacked!</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence was one of the most mysterious fusion skills Wang Yan had ever seen. Its power was incredible, but its disadvantages were also clearly evident. It could only be used to attack in a straight line. Therefore, unless the opponent was unable to move, there was no way it could hit seven people like that!</p>
 <p>“It’s not that simple.” Dai Yueheng suddenly said. His words attracted everyone’s attention.</p>
 <p>He continued, “Didn’t you notice? Yuhao and Wang Dong’s fusion skill has gotten stronger than before. However, neither has their cultivation increased nor have they broken through any bottlenecks. This means that they pushed themselves to the extreme and used some special means to maximise the power of their fusion skill. This is how they were able to defeat the opponents in one move. Facing such a move, the enemy must have thought that they would suffer serious injuries. This thought scared them so much that they directly jumped down from the platform.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei nodded and said, “Classmate Dai’s words are reasonable. Given their current strength, the might of their fusion skill should be pretty high.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan stood up, his face slightly flushed as he smiled. His gaze passed across Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, Xiao Xiao and He Caitou as he spoke, “They preserved Shrek Academy’s honor, it doesn’t matter how they did it. In fact, I dare claim that this is the most satisfying victory that has ever been obtained by Shrek Academy since their first participation in the Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. You let everyone experience Shrek Academy’s power, and silenced all those who were questioning you. I sincerely thank all of you on behalf of the academy.”</p>
 <p>With that, Wang Dong bowed toward Bei Bei’s five and Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong that were sleeping on the sofa.</p>
 <p>This victory was incredibly important for Shrek Academy! With this win, they hadn’t been eliminated in the first round and had secured a place in the following elimination round. Now only time would tell how they would continue to fare, but Ma Xiaotao and the other two were bound to recover in middle of the elimination phase. Additionally, with the strength they had exhibited today, no matter which academy they would fight next, their opponents would surely be scared.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “Teacher Wang, don’t worry. As we wait for reinforcements from the academy and the recovery of our teammates, we’ll try our very best to win every match.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan nodded. “First go put Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong on the bed and let them have a good rest. They did very well today. I’ll elaborate a strategy based on today’s results. As long as you capitalize on this opportunity, you should have it easy in the next match.”</p>
 <p>Everyone thought little of it, but Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong ended up sleeping together in the same bed once again...</p>
 <p>After recovering from the shock of the first match, the Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament advanced in full swing. However, Huo Yuhao’s performance in the first match was still deeply engraved in the minds of the audience and the other competitors, along with his overbearing last sentence. The names ‘Shrek Academy’ and ‘Tang Sect’ had become hot topics in Star Luo City overnight.</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong woke up, it was already evening.</p>
 <p>To be more accurate, Wang Dong woke up first, and Huo Yuhao was startled awake as a consequence.</p>
 <p>When he woke up, Wang Dong discovered that another person was sleeping with him, and his first reaction was to kick that person!</p>
 <p>Then, Yuhao’s tragedy began. How could he not wake up once he fell to the ground on his butt?</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” Huo Yuhao exclaimed angrily as he climbed back onto the bed.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing it was Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong replied somewhat embarrassedly, “I didn’t know it was you! And why are you in my room anyway?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was startled. He looked around as he hugged the quilt close to him and responded with even more indignation, “Nonsense! This is clearly my room. Not only did you sleep in my bed, but you also dared to kick me down. Do you not have a conscience?!”</p>
 <p>“Ugh… I have no idea how I ended up here!” After a brief moment of awkwardness, Wang Dong opened his eyes wide and exclaimed, “What are you yelling for? It’s not like you’re going to die from falling of a bed, and you even want to be in the right after sleeping with me!”</p>
 <p>“It’s not like I want to be right; I am right. And so what if we slept together? It’s not like this is the first time.”</p>
 <p>“You…”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong discovered that he couldn’t win this argument against Huo Yuhao. He quickly turned his body and pressed Yuhao beneath him while separated by the quilt. He relied on his superior soul power to hold his shoulders down and sit on his body.</p>
 <p>“Do you surrender or not?” Wang Dong asked wickedly.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao laughed. “Of course not. What are you going to do about it?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was startled when he realised that he really couldn’t do much to Huo Yuhao. While he was in a daze, Huo Yuhao quickly took advantage of the opportunity. His shoulders were held down, but he could still move his forearms! His small arm drilled out of the quilt and gently poked Wang Dong’s waist.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong retreated as if he had received an electric shock and started laughing. How could Yuhao let go of this opportunity? He pulled his arm free and turned around, pressing Wang Dong down.</p>
 <p>Even though the quilt was still separating them, Huo Yuhao could still feel Wang Dong’s soft body. He smiled wickedly as he spoke, “Your body is very soft and even works wonders as a pillow. Do you surrender or not?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong copied Huo Yuhao’s previous appearance and replied, “Of course not. What are you going to do about it?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s gaze started to wander from his face to the rest of his body, and a crafty look flashed through his eyes. Wang Dong become a little nervous as he asked, “W-What are you going to do?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao smiled. “If I’m not mistaken, someone is very ticklish.” As he said that, his hands that were holding Wang Dong down went lower, poking at his waist.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…”</p>
 <p>Immediately, Wang Dong started to laugh, and his body arched like a dried shrimp.</p>
 <p>“I surrender, I surrender. Let me go. I won’t argue with you again. I’m dying. Hahaha…”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao suddenly stopped and looked at Wang Dong in a daze.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong gasped for breath as he pushed Yuhao away from him, “J-Just wait and see! A gentleman can wait ten years to take revenge!”</p>
 <p>However, it seemed like Huo Yuhao hadn't heard his threat. He suddenly raised his hand and said, “Wang Dong, how come your voice changed just now?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao discovered that when he was tickling Wang Dong, his voice had suddenly changed and become very pleasant to hear, reminiscent of the sweet sound of a silver bell. This was completely different from his usual voice. Huo Yuhao had known him for more than a year and during that year they were always together. Hence, he would immediately notice even the smallest irregularities,</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was startled, a hint of fear that was very difficult to notice flashed through his eyes. He quickly said, “Nonsense. How is that even possible? You probably misheard. Moreover, I couldn’t even breathe properly due to you; it’s only normal that my voice became strange. You don’t really think I’m someone else, right?”</p>
 <p>Yuhao nodded seriously and replied, “That’s also true. It would be difficult to imitate a stinky brat like you.”</p>
 <p>“Bullshit. I’m showering every day. My skin smells really good! You’re the stinky one!”</p>
 <p>When he saw that Wang Dong was beginning to get angry, Huo Yuhao hurriedly changed the topic, “Fine, let’s stop arguing. We still have a match to win tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was momentarily at a loss. He recalled the scene where the entire nation was watching them. In particular, the Huo Yuhao that had proudly fought in front of hundreds of thousands of people... was this really the same person that was bullying him right now…? How would the rest of the competition go?</p>
