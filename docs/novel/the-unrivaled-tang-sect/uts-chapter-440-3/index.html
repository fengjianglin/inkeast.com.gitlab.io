 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Huo Yuhao wanted to find a day where the visibility was high to carry out his surveillance. His reason was very simple; he was able to conceal himself in the air with his Imitation, and couldn’t be detected by the naked eye. When the weather was good, his enemies would be able to see everything in the sky when they lifted their heads. It was easier for them to be careless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They planned the mission for an entire morning. It was lunchtime before they agreed that they were done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

The sky was completely clear, and there weren’t any clouds. The clear sky was like a huge sapphire. The blinding sunlight filled the world with the aura of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weather was very good.</span></p>

He turned around and walked towards his tent. After he returned, he regrouped his thoughts there for a moment before leaving for lunch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

She managed to get a look at his side profile as he peered into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When sunlight fell on his slightly pale face, the slight smile on his face left Tang Wutong a little weirded out.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why is there this sense of desperation that I can feel from his smile? Don’t tell me that he’s suicidal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Tang Wutong didn’t see it wrong. His mental state was a little weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since he had discovered that Tang Wutong’s soul power couldn’t fuse with his, he had felt very mournful.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Douluo Continent is so huge. If Dong’er has already forgotten me, how will I be able to find her? Tang Wutong’s not Dong’er. So where is she? Don’t tell me that Dong’er’s already…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to these confusing and complicated thoughts, he felt a little empty. He had been through too many things over the past year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since he had gone to the Setting Sun Forest to find the Yearning Heartbroken Grass for Wang Dong’er, he had never completely spent time with her. After that, Wang Qiu’er sacrificed herself, and Wang Dong’er fell into a coma. He entered a mental state of near-desolation after that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the fact that he was extremely mentally resilient, he would have broken down already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had numbed himself by keeping himself busy. From the beast wave to the establishment of the Spirit Pagoda to his recognition of Dai Luoli, he tried to stop himself from thinking about Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er. He had gotten through each day because of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Tang Wutong’s appearance changed everything. Her appearance had rekindled his hope. However, this hope was extinguished one last time, and he was greatly devastated once again. The impact on him was hard to imagine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His exterior calm was actually a reflection of his deep inner depression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the scariest when one lost all hope. It was highly likely that Huo Yuhao’s current mental state was the reason why he was adamant on surveying the Death God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the meeting today, there was one point that he had never mentioned. The Death God was the strongest soul tool that the Sun Moon Empire had. At the same time, it was controlled by the strongest soul engineer in the Sun Moon Empire, the Death God Douluo! No one knew how great the Death God Douluo’s abilities were. Few people knew what he looked like. Under such a situation, Huo Yuhao was at great risk trying to carry out this reconnaissance mission. However, he didn’t really care anymore. He even thought that it might be a form of relief if he died on this mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli knew his true identity. If he died, Dai Luoli would surely tell the White Tiger Duke his true identity. When that happened, would Dai Hao be heartbroken? If he was, it would be sort of a revenge for Dai Hao. He had sent his own son to the battlefield of no return. It was actually frustrating to think about that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Wang Dong’er, even if she was still alive, she had already forgotten him. Perhaps his death would be good for her. Her family didn’t tell her anything about him, even though she had regained consciousness. This must mean that they were unhappy with him. Perhaps his death would signal a new beginning for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When someone was resigned to fate, many of their thoughts would deviate from the norm. Huo Yuhao was exactly like that right now. Regarding the mission, he was already prepared for the worst.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lunch was very peaceful. No one could tell the difference. Huo Yuhao was even chatting and laughing with his fellow comrades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After lunch, Xu Sanshi asked Huo Yuhao, “Yuhao, are you going to go tonight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “It’s better to go early. At least the matter will be settled sooner.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi furrowed his brow and said, “What do you mean by settled? That sounds bad. Yuhao, you must be careful. We’ll coordinate with you from the sky and ground today. Don’t engage in any fights, no matter what you find. Come back immediately after scanning the area once.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged his words readily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong kept on glancing at him from the side. For some reason, she felt very tense no matter what Huo Yuhao said. She had never experienced such a feeling before. This feeling became even more acute when she looked at his expression when he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surely there isn’t something wrong with him, right? Why am I so concerned about his safety? Just because we’re in the same boat?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong didn’t understand why he was in such a state either. However, she had a premonition that tonight’s mission wouldn’t proceed that smoothly. Perhaps he might really meet with danger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me liaise with him in the sky tonight,” Tang Wutong suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh?” Huo Yuhao was a little stunned as he lifted his head to look at Tang Wutong. All he saw was the slightly troubled look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was the most adept at flying among those from the Academy here. Not only was her martial soul adept at flying, but she was even a Soul Sage. Ye Guyi was the next best. Ye Guyi’s holy martial soul could unleash angelic wings and fly freely in the air. However, the light from her martial soul was too strong, and would be too obvious in the night sky. Thus, she could only use flying-type soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi nodded and said, ‘That’s a great idea. Let’s all take action tonight then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought for a moment before saying, “Alright, let me make a plan then. We cannot be reckless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong and Ye Guyi were responsible for liaising with Huo Yuhao from the air, while Xu Sanshi and the rest would work with him from the ground. After all, Xu Sanshi’s Mysterious Underworld Displacement made it much easier for him to liaise with Huo Yuhao. After the enhancements he received from the Golden Tortoise, his Mysterious Underworld Displacement could work at a much greater distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao immediately returned to his own tent to meditate after he finished planning, restoring himself to his peak condition. The others did the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

When he awoke, the sky had already turned dark.</span></p>
