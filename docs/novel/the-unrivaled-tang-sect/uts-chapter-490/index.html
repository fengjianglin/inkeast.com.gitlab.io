 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an invisible air current around Huo Yuhao’s arms guiding these pieces of metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon,” Bei Bei muttered softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven pieces of metal slowly gathered. Under Huo Yuhao’s control, they were congregating towards the silver ball drifting in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This works?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Xuan Ziwen was watching with a learning attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of the three groups of core formations, this was the group that was the most difficult to form. The difficulty lay in the fact that the core formations had to be joined together as the soul master poured his soul power into them. There wasn’t any room for error at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Xuan Ziwen could do it, he would still need some tools to complete it. But right now, Huo Yuhao was only using his own abilities. Wasn’t he afraid that his soul power was insufficient?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core spun quickly, and provided a large amount of soul and spiritual power to him. The seven core formations in the air were under his strict observation. He adjusted their positions and slowly but steadily brought them together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they were only an inch from the silver ball, Huo Yuhao stopped them, then poured his soul power into all of them at the same time. Immediately, these seven core formations brightened and emitted a gentle silver light. Huo Yuhao carefully controlled them as they combined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his Spiritual Detection in action, he didn’t need to worry about any errors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clang!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An apple-sized group of core formations was formed. Blinding silver light was rapidly sucking away Huo Yuhao’s soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among these eight core formations were energy-storing core formations. This Class 8 decomposition cannon had to maintain the circulation of soul power within it as a means of stabilizing its spatial power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was completely in a daze right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did Huo Yuhao make this process seem so simple?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a long breath as he saw the silver metal ball drifting in front of him. “I’ve finally completed the critical step.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following up on this, he joined the other two groups of core formations. Since he had already assembled the most difficult set, the other two groups were naturally not a problem for him. The next step would be the installation process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark sky slowly turned deep blue. Dawn was about to arrive. Huo Yuhao held the one and-a-half-meter Class 8 decomposition cannon that was shining with dim silver light as he stopped in front of Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He has actually completed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen automatically took the cannon in his hands. He didn’t need to test it, he had personally watched Huo Yuhao create it. Even though he didn’t use a conventional method, he didn’t make any mistakes throughout the entire process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pulled a chair over and sat down. “I’ve finally finished it within the time limit. Teacher Xuan, can I go this time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen used one hand to hold the cannon as he grabbed Huo Yuhao with his other hand, asking, “Yuhao, did you learn how to create soul tools from someone else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly, “No! Didn’t you see how raw I was?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s lips moved, “Raw? You call this raw? You managed to make a Class 8 soul tool after seeing the blueprint for only three days. It’s even a complex decomposition cannon. You dare to call this raw?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little embarrassed. “Teacher Xuan, have you forgotten? I was able to make a soul tool above my class a long time ago! When I was a Class 5 soul engineer, I could already make a Class 6 soul tool. That’s why it’s really nothing much. My spiritual power is above average. I have a natural advantage when creating the core formations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was a little speechless now. A genius indeed couldn’t be measured using common logic!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kid has become a Class 8 soul engineer just like that? Isn’t this too ridiculous?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, you can’t go. I want you to remain and learn the basic knowledge of a Class 8 soul engineer under me. I have the confidence that you’ll become a Class 9 soul engineer as long as you can become a Titled Douluo in the future. Furthermore, what we really lack now is a talented soul engineer. No matter what, you can’t leave this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Seeing how persistent Xuan Ziwen was, Huo Yuhao was completely annoyed now. “Teacher Xuan, you can’t go back on your word! Didn’t we agree? If I make this decomposition cannon, you’ll let me go. Don’t worry, I’ll be back within a month.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was adamant. “No. Do you know how precious one month is? If the war continues, do you know when the enemy will come? Furthermore, I’m not going back on my word. You haven’t finished this decomposition cannon. Don’t tell me that you can make this soul tool unleash its full strength, even though an eight-ringed Soul Douluo would find it difficult?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression turned weird as he looked at Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei patted his shoulder and said, “Yuhao, why don’t you stay behind? I’ve already arranged things on the other side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “No, eldest senior. It would be fine if it were something else. But we’re going to save Teacher Xiao Ya this time. I have to go. Teacher Xuan, though I don’t wish to contradict you, I have to tell you that I can easily use this decomposition cannon if that means that I can participate in the mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rascal, are you out of your mind? It’s already not easy for you to create a Class 8 soul tool. You still want to go above your class and try to use it? Creating it and using it are two different concepts.” Xuan Ziwen rambled on furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “Teacher Xuan, my soul power is already at Rank 80. In addition, I have twin martial souls. I have a natural advantage in terms of the total amount of soul power I have. Additionally, the purity of my soul power and the recovery ability of my spiritual soul core means that I can even try a Class 9 soul tool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Rank 80?” Xuan Ziwen wasn’t the only one who exclaimed this time. Bei Bei, He Caitou, and Ji Juechen all shouted out at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao scratched his head and said, “When I got those Ice Divine Crystals, I inadvertently discovered some Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence. Only I can absorb it. That is why I made great progress. Oh, yes, eldest senior, I went to the Icefire Yin Yang Well and brought back some good stuff. I’ll share it with everyone later. The plant-type soul beasts in the well gave them to me. It’s the essence that they produced themselves. I believe it can help everyone’s cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei looked at Huo Yuhao before turning to Xuan Ziwen. He probed, “Teacher Xuan, surely Yuhao wasn’t slacking, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s breathing had become a little unbalanced. “Slack your head!” After he finished speaking, he turned his head and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao thought he was angry, Xuan Ziwen’s voice sounded back from outside. “One month, just one month. One month later, you’d better get back. Do you understand me? You won’t be able to leave then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I understand!” Huo Yuhao was delighted. He knew that he had finally convinced Teacher Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen didn’t persist in asking Huo Yuhao to test the cannon, he believed Huo Yuhao wasn’t lying.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rank 80? He’s already Rank 80 at his age? He must have set a record in Shrek Academy’s history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen appeared to be furious as he left. However, he was actually quite delighted. Huo Yuhao’s foundation was there. He had full confidence that he could nurture Huo Yuhao into a true Class 8 soul engineer in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This matter is finally settled.” Huo Yuhao only wanted to sleep right now. He had drained a lot of his energy over the past three days and nights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little junior, are you fine? If not, we can leave a day later,” Bei Bei asked concernedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and answered, “There’s no need for that, eldest senior. We can’t make Dean Yan and Elder Song wait for us. I’m fine. I’ll grab a bite later. I’ll take this time to meditate for two hours and eat just before we leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was in a good mood, too. With Huo Yuhao around, he was more confident in their mission this time. This was especially true after he realized that Huo Yuhao’s soul power had reached Rank 80. It meant that the Tang Sect finally had a Soul Douluo, apart from Teacher Xuan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little junior, keep the stuff that you brought back from the Icefire Yin Yang Well with you. There’s bound to be casualties because of the war. We’ll give them to whoever needs them. It’s a waste to directly use it to increase our cultivations. Furthermore, we are cultivating quite well right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sounds good.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged his words and immediately started to meditate. There was nothing better than meditating to restore his energy right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">----------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Daybreak...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky had already turned bright, and Bei Bei led those from the Tang Sect outside Shrek Academy as they silently followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was still a little listless even though he had already grabbed a bite to eat. However, some of his energy had been restored after resting for two hours. He could only rest after getting to the front lines, but Shrek Academy wasn’t too far from the fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long afterward, Dean Yan Shaozhe and Elder Song walked out from the Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Song, Dean Yan.” Bei Bei rushed up to receive them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song smiled and asked, “Are you guys ready?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re all ready,” Bei Bei answered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song was the most senior, and also the strongest. It was obvious that she was leading the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was leading the people from the Tang Sect. With Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, Huo Yuhao, Xiao Xiao, Ji Juechen, Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi with him, they indeed had a strong lineup for this mission. Only a few leading figures from the Soul Tool Hall remained in the Tang Sect. Xuan Ziwen, He Caitou, Gao Dalou, Na Na and Jing Ziyan were all holding the fort at headquarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, let’s move out.” Elder Song waved her hand. She was already rising into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe nodded at everyone else before he flew after her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since the last beast wave and he was emotionally hurt, he had been keeping a low profile. Now that he was following Elder Song to the front line, and considering that Elder Song was Xian Lin’er’s mother, he became even more reserved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone from the Tang Sect followed behind the two Transcendent Douluo and proceeded towards the front line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City was within the Heavenly Soul Empire’s territory, located to the southeast of the empire. Even though more than two-thirds of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s territory had been occupied, the area west of Shrek City was still under the Heavenly Soul Empire’s control. Apart from that, the empire still controlled most of the southeast parts of its borders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The south of the empire was linked to the Star Luo Empire. To prevent the Sun Moon Empire from attacking them from the south, the Star Luo Empire did their best to support the Heavenly Soul Empire. This helped the remaining troops of the Heavenly Soul Empire regain some stability.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">East of the Heavenly Soul Empire was the Dou Ling Empire. Close to half of the Dou Ling Empire’s troops were in the Heavenly Soul Empire, trying to resist the Sun Moon Empire. The three empires of the original Douluo Continent could be said to be banding together to fight a common enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The team from Shrek needed to cross the plains of the Heavenly Soul Empire and reach the north, before proceeding to the northwest. In less than five hundred kilometers, they would reach the front line. The Sun Moon Empire’s army was that close to Shrek City.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone as strong as Elder Song could fly for two hours at her fastest speed and reach the front line. With the Tang Sect team with her, they would need around four hours. From afar, the Sun Moon Empire’s military base could be seen on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time that everyone from the Tang Sect had seen a battlefield of such a scale. Compared to the border with the Star Luo Empire, the battlefield here was much larger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire had set up their base of operations in a city known as Heavenly Spirit City. As they had too many soldiers, they had no choice but to extend their formations outside the city. Most of the army was quite spread out, keeping them all from being targeted by a single powerful soul tool.Since the start of the war, the Heavenly Soul Empire had on many occasions suffered at the hands of stationary soul cannons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were close to five hundred thousand soldiers from the three empires here. The Heavenly Soul Empire had the most soldiers here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A number greater than a hundred thousand was already very impressive, not to mention five hundred thousand. From the sky, it appeared like there were an infinite number of soldiers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, the Sun Moon Empire had around three hundred thousand soldiers, twenty-five kilometers from the borders of the Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The weather was very good today, so the entire battlefield was visible. This was especially true for Huo Yuhao, who used his Spirit Eyes. He could even see the aerial surveillance soul tools over the Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a vast battlefield!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Star Luo Empire had many soldiers, most of the empire was covered in mountainous regions, and the scale of its army was also not as great as that of the Heavenly Soul and Sun Moon Empires. It wasn’t very obvious that they had so many soldiers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rest for a moment.” Elder Song asked everyone to stop. They weren’t too far from Heavenly Spirit City. In a war, misunderstandings arose easily. To prevent this, it wasn’t wise for them to advance recklessly.</span></p>
