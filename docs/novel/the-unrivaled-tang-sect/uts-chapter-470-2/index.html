 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his attacks were all too closely-linked, he couldn’t care about using any auxiliary-type soul skills. Even so, his Star Anise Omnithrust still covered an area that spanned more than two hundred meters in diameter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an icy place near the Extreme North, the coldest region in the entire world. Here, all ice-type abilities were greatly enhanced. Huo Yuhao’s martial soul was Ultimate Ice. It was obvious that his abilities would be greatly strengthened here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huge ice spikes as long as three meters and as thick as water buckets shot out in all directions. These terrifying spikes tore some of the tents apart. The soul engineers were sent flying into the sky even though they were protected by protective soul barriers. Some of the soul engineers who were slightly weaker were even stabbed through by the spikes. Huo Yuhao was suddenly free of any soul engineers around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s left hand was about to grab hold of the lady’s neck, but a layer of golden light suddenly appeared on the lady’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Invincible Barrier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao really wanted to curse. The reason why he continued using his spiritual-type attack on the enemy was because he hoped to make her lose her awareness, so that she wouldn’t be able to use her Invincible Barrier or any types of abilities similar to that of an Invincible Barrier. An Invincible Barrier could last for more than ten seconds! How would he stand a chance then?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao still had to continue on, even though the Invincible Barrier had been unleashed. He didn’t continue attacking the lady, which would be a waste of his soul power. His eyes flashed, and he switched to his Spirit Eyes. A white halo quickly spread out from his body. Huo Yuhao unleashed his Mass Enfeeblement under the effect of his soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Mass Enfeeblement spread in all directions, and large patches of red light started to appear in bursts. This was a fire-type attack, which the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion was most adept at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted his eyes. He clenched his left hand into a fist, and loud booms started to detonate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The booms echoed, and the explosions were centered around Huo Yuhao and the lady. They were spreading out wildly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fiery-red lights were immediately devoured. At this instant, it seemed as if a terrifying and brutal snowstorm with terrifying explosive force was raging. Ice flakes were dancing in the sky, and the intense explosive force was so strong that even a Titled Douluo would have to stay away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned deep-blue, and a figure silently surfaced behind him. It was the Snow Empress, who had already recovered her origin and regained her memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress didn’t open her mouth. She drifted silently behind Huo Yuhao. She reached out her hand and pointed to the sky with one hand, and to the ground with her other hand. The intense explosions weren’t even able to get close to Huo Yuhao and the Snow Empress. The ice flakes in the sky instantly turned into a snowstorm under the Snow Empress’ control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao switched back to his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. His seven soul rings started to shine brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the support of the Snow Empress, the strongest version of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was unleashed. At the same time, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass surfaced from Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. Blue halos quickly spread out. This was the strengthening effect of his Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The terrifying Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice instantly raged, and everything within a region spanning several thousands of meters was trapped within it. Almost the entire military base was caught in this region. Although the soul engineers were strong, they could only maintain their linked defensive soul formation. It was impossible to see what was going on inside the domain. Everyone’s senses, the soul tools that were locked onto Huo Yuhao, and all surveillance soul tools lost their effect in the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the lady seemed to have regained her awareness. She suddenly turned around and looked at Huo Yuhao, who was still imitating the old lady’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw Huo Yuhao’s seven soul rings, she was completely shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What soul ring colors are these? Out of his seven soul rings, four don’t even belong to the normal scheme of colors, and the other three are hundred-thousand-year soul rings. Is he really a soul master?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was in a daze as she looked at Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao was about to unleash his full strength at her under the cover of his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, but he also went into a daze after seeing her. He was completely amazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju, Ju Zi…” Something seemed to be stuck in Huo Yuhao’s throat. His voice changed slightly at this instant. He didn’t expect that this cunning marshal was actually Ju Zi, whom he had not seen in a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In her military outfit, Ju Zi appeared very suave. Her crystal-clear skin was still as smooth and clear as ever. Her beautiful big eyes were locked onto Huo Yuhao in disbelief. Both of them were just staring at each other just like that. Their expressions were about the same: they were both in complete disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who, who are you?” Ju Zi was astonished when she heard the other party calling her name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A light projection flashed, and Huo Yuhao removed his Imitation. He looked at Ju Zi and laughed bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi subconsciously lifted her hand to cover her lips. Huo Yuhao hadn’t expected the enemy to be her, and she also hadn’t expected that the person who had caused such heavy losses to the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion and brought her such a headache today was actually Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You, you, why is it you? How could it be you?” Ju Zi’s voice was filled with shock and astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and replied, “It’s me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Snow Empress’ cold voice sounded, “Quickly, take action. This domain is unable to handle the pressure much longer. They’ll soon make their way here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body shook, and there was a complicated look on his face as he looked at Ju Zi, her Invincible Barrier started to dim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi also looked at Huo Yuhao with a complicated expression. She sighed, “Damn it!” She didn’t activate her second Invincible Barrier. She turned around and hugged Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao subconsciously grabbed onto her waist. At this instant, he felt extremely emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did have some feelings for Ju Zi. Back then, his relationship with Wang Dong’er wasn’t established yet. In his eyes, Wang Dong’er was still Wang Dong, and a guy. Ju Zi was probably the first woman that he had developed some feelings for. It was just that their identities, backgrounds and a series of changes had happened, such as Wang Dong’er’s appearance, causing them to slowly drift apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their next few meetings were also very rushed. Huo Yuhao could still clearly remember that Ju Zi took the risk to send him a letter during the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament in Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, even though it was Ju Zi who was in his embrace, he felt his heart throbbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju Zi, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi suppressed her inner emotions and said, “I am the marshal of this army. If you hold me as your hostage, they won’t dare to do anything to you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally knew that this wasn’t the time for them to catch up on old times. As he placed one hand over her waist, he gently pressed his other hand on her neck. He looked into the sky and shouted, “Stop! Your marshal is in my hands!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Huo Yuhao had gotten his wish, the Snow Empress glared at him with a weird look on her face. After this, she turned into a beam of flowing light and re-entered his body, and the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice slowly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion immediately ceased fire as Huo Yuhao shouted. Following the disappearance of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, red figures started to slowly surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked very cold and indifferent as he stood there. Right now, he had yet to revert to his original appearance. He continued to use his Imitation to mimic the look of that old lady. He stood behind Ju Zi, and one of his hands was on her waist, while the other was in a stranglehold around her neck. A killing aura spread. Given his spiritual power, it was easy for him to imitate a strong killing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice disappeared, Huo Yuhao finally saw that the sky had been completely covered by a red barrier. Every member of the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion had a diamond-shaped soul tool on their chests that shone brightly with red light. Evidently, those were their linked defensive soul tools. It was a linked defense unleashed by several hundred advanced-tier soul engineers. He couldn’t possibly breach such a defense. His earlier strategy was correct, which was to take the marshal hostage. It was the only way out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that Ju Zi was the marshal. However, no matter what, this act had to continue. Ju Zi also seemed very willing to play along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone watched Huo Yuhao intently. A fiery-red figure rapidly made it to the front and watched him coldly. Wasn’t she the Class 9 soul engineer that Huo Yuhao had imitated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them stared at each other. The scene was very weird. Huo Yuhao was completely surrounded by the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. All types of advanced-tier cannons were aimed at him. he started to get numb and itchy as a multitude of soul tools locked onto him. Once an order was given, Huo Yuhao would be instantly torn to pieces when so many powerful soul tools fired at him.</span></p>
