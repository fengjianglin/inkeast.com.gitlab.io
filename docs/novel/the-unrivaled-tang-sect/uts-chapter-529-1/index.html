 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with Ju Zi’s current strength, which wasn’t more than a Soul Sage, she could temporarily possess a Titled Douluo’s defensive capability and mobility for a short period of time using this set of armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Ju Zi was just sitting there holding a few sets of tiny clothes in her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She touched her cheek to the fabric and gently rubbed the clothes against her cheeks as transparent teardrops splattered down. Her eyes were full of despondence and helplessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though she was an empress, she could clearly feel in this moment that there was nobody in the world who could help her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yunhan, Yunhan, are you alright? Have those people hurt you?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My son, my son, where are you!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how tough a woman could be, she would still become incredibly weak and fragile when her child was involved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was unwilling to compromise for her, and there was no arguing the matter. Even though Ju Zi had an extremely exalted status within the Sun Moon Empire’s army, she still couldn’t go against Xu Tianran, who was the true ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wouldn’t get her son back if Xu Tianran wasn’t willing to compromise, and she knew that Xu Tianran would make the same decision even if he had been the father of her child, though he might hesitate for a little longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran, Xu Tianran! What an evil king. If my son dies, then one day, I will destroy you!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi bit down on her lower lip as her body quivered incessantly. Her tears had already moistened the tiny clothes in her hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The war was about to start, and she was waiting for the army to gather. She hated Xu Tianran, and she hated those who had kidnapped her child even more. She wanted to go crazy, and she wanted to tell those who had kidnapped her son through war that she would annihilate everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, a woman who had lost her child was absolutely one of the most frightening living beings on earth. There was no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are you, Yunhan? Do you know how much I miss you? Yunhan, my son, I will save you even if there’s but the slightest chance. I will save you even if I can no longer be Empress, and I can no longer have my revenge. You are my life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tears flowed from her cheeks like a waterfall, and Ju Zi could no longer control herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you really going to give up on your revenge?” A gentle voice travelled into Ju Zi’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi trembled as she jumped up from her bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was her bedroom, the Empress’ bedroom! There were many powerful individuals standing guard outside. Nobody could enter her bedroom without being discovered unless it was Xu Tianran himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this voice is just so crisp and bright, and it’s familiar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s originally blurry and teary eyes immediately became sharp, and she placed her child’s clothes to one side. She pressed something to her chest, and a rose helmet immediately rose from both sides of her shoulders and completely covered her within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be nervous, it’s me. Ask your guards outside to leave and open the door, I want to see you.” That gentle voice rang out once more, and it was even more familiar this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s eyes suddenly narrowed. She could tell who was here, and an incredulous look appeared in her teary eyes. She was like a statue as she remained fixated to the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She only reacted after several full seconds had gone by. She covered her mouth so she could force herself not to scream out loud, and patted her chest with her other hand continuously so she could calm herself down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had no idea why he would appear inside the Sun Moon Empire’s royal palace at a time like this. But his appearance was like a lifeline to her, in all her helplessness, grief, and agonizing. She felt like someone who had been drowning who had just grabbed onto a floating piece of wood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She forced down her emotions after a few moments as she walked to the gate and opened it before she lowered her voice and said, “Leave, all of you. I want to be alone for a while. If I even hear anyone’s breathing, I will hang you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her four servant girls, who were already quiet and shivering with fear, hurriedly took their leave. They were very aware that the Empress’ mood hadn’t been good for the past few days, and nobody dared to infuriate the Goddess of War at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi pushed the gate open and stood at its entrance. She still wore a grievous expression on her face with traces of tears down her cheeks. She didn’t know how long she had to keep the door open for him to come in, but she couldn’t possibly ask all her secret guardians to leave. That would be too obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, you can close the door.” That familiar voice rang out once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi shut the door and walked back into her bedroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two silhouettes that flowed like water appeared out of thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s him, it really is him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tears that she had just held back flowed out uncontrollably once more when she saw who had come to see her. But she didn’t leap over in the end, because there was a figure next to him who she was familiar with, and full of jealousy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s really you, Yuhao. Why have you come?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mama?” A small arm that was like a tiny white lotus reached out from within Huo Yuhao’s arms following her greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s voice froze. She stared at Huo Yuhao in disbelief, and then into his arms, and she became like a gust of wind as she dashed over and took the child from Huo Yuhao’s hands and into her own tight embrace. Ju Zi began to bawl uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth curved into a faint smile as he watched mother and son, reunited. His smile was filled with satisfaction, and no matter what he had given and the decisions he had made for this, he believed that everything was worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had lost his mother when he was just a child, and he knew how painful it was for a child to lose his or her mother. He watched as little Yunhan and Ju Zi were reunited with each other. He watched as this mother held her son so tightly in her arms. Huo Yuhao’s heart was content, and he could almost see himself in his mother’s embrace when he was a little child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tears continued flowing down Ju Zi’s cheeks as she hugged little Yunhan. The past two days were almost like two centuries for her, and not in her wildest dreams did she expect him to send her child back to her. But in this moment, her precious son who she loved so much was the only person in her heart, and in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t worried at all, and he was just standing there quietly with Tang Wutong next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong went up to his ear and whispered, “I’ll go outside. You should speak to her.” She released Huo Yuhao’s hand as she spoke and stepped out by herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had grown up and matured since she had regained her memory, and she knew when to let go of her man. It was like flying a kite; no matter how far the kite flew, what was there to be afraid of as long as the string was still in her hands?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi cried with little Yunhan in her arms for a long time. The little fellow was very well-behaved, and continuously wiped his mother’s tears as he stared at his mother with large, confused eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something that he said finally stopped Ju Zi’s tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daddy, did you bully mommy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was stunned, and her tears stopped just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said a little awkwardly, “I don’t know why he keeps calling me that. Perhaps fate has brought me together with this little fellow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi muttered blankly, “Fate, fate. It truly is fate!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao coughed and said, “I’ve sent your child back to you. I think you can guess what happened, and I have to leave as soon as possible. But you have to fabricate a story about how the child has returned so that you won’t bring trouble upon yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned and walked out as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he knew he shouldn’t be doing that, watching Ju Zi crying agonizingly with her child in her arms reminded him of the child’s father, the Sun Moon Empire’s Emperor, Xu Tianran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know Wang Dong was Wang Dong’er when he first met Ju Zi. She could be said to be the first girl to have entered his heart, but Ju Zi couldn’t let go of the resentment and hatred in her heart, so they lost their chance to get together. Ju Zi chose Xu Tianran, but just as Huo Yuhao had left a deep imprint in her heart, Ju Zi had also left her mark on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait,” Ju Zi stopped Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao paused in his tracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi stared at him, and her lips trembled as she asked, “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh and said, “This child shouldn’t be harmed by the war. I lost my mother, and I know how painful it is. In the beginning, I didn’t know that this mission’s target was actually your son. I would have stopped them from the start if I did. I have returned your child, so you must take care of him in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi bit down on her rosy lips as she stared at him with a complicated look in her eyes. “What are you asking for in return?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled as he shook his head and said, “If I make any requests of you, then what difference is there between those who kidnapped your son and me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s eyes became a little dazed. “But did you not see the thousands and thousands of soldiers gathered outside Radiant City?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes suddenly became sharp. “Perhaps we can only be enemies in this lifetime. But even if we are to be enemies, I can only meet you face to face on the battlefield. I will not use your child to threaten you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi lowered her head. “You’ll be in quite some trouble for bringing the child back, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and answered, “I will deal with it. You don’t have to worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi took a deep breath and raised her head bravely as she stared into his eyes. “If I had agreed to leave with you back then instead of staying behind to chase after Xu Tianran, you would have chosen me and not her, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Her” was naturally referring to Tang Wutong, who was outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned his head and looked out. He had no intention of hiding anything from Tang Wutong, so he didn’t want to cut his voice off from the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know. I didn’t know she was a girl back then. Perhaps…” Huo Yuhao had just said those words when Ju Zi dashed over with little Yunhan in her arms and fell into his arms. She hugged her child with one hand and wrapped the other tightly around him, and her tears began to flow uncontrollably once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned, but he didn’t have the heart to push her away in the end.</span></p>
