 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong sighed slightly and said, “I might have thought the same thing if it was before I met Elder Long and Ye Xishui. However, I beg to differ now. Ultimate Douluo have their own killer moves. They have their own understanding of this world. Perhaps our cultivations might have reached that tier, but we cannot considered Ultimate Douluo before we develop our own understanding. That’s why we must continue to work harder. We’ll definitely be able to reach that tier. When that happens, the world will be very different.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed as he said, “Well said. I’ll always be with you no matter what. We’ll charge towards that tier and that world.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, his cultivation was already similar to that of an Ultimate Douluo! How could he not be excited? It was what he had been pursuing all this while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re almost there. Let me check.” Huo Yuhao controlled their speed as he held Tang Wutong’s hand. He slowed down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had indeed been to this place before. The dense forest in front of him turned from dark-green to pitch-black. In the entire continent, only this forest had such a special characteristic. It was because this was the Evildemon Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, the Holy Ghost Church’s headquarters was in this forest. If not for the information provided by Long Xiaoyao, no one would have guessed this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Sun Moon Empire, the Evildemon Forest was like the Great Star Dou Forest in the Douluo Continent. The strongest soul beasts that lived in the Sun Moon Empire were in this forest. This included Evileye Tyrant King, ranked second among the Ten Great Savage Beasts</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had obtained the seventh soul ring of his Spirit Eyes here. He had killed a hundred thousand year Evileye Tyrant, before he was discovered by the Evileye Tyrant King and barely escaped death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was different from how he was in the past right now. This time, he might not be afraid of those Evileye Tyrants anymore. However, what he didn’t understand was why the Holy Ghost Church had located their headquarters here. It was no issue for those powerful evil soul masters. But what about the weaker evil soul masters? When they faced powerful soul beasts, their lives would be in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, it was good enough if he could find evil soul masters here. Without the protection of the Death God Douluo, no one here could stop them anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he landed, Huo Yuhao had already unleashed his Spiritual Detection. It was like a huge web that engulfed the entire forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao had only told him about the Evildemon Forest. He didn’t specify exactly where the Holy Ghost Church was in the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao surveyed the forest, he was very cautious. After all, there was a savage beast living here who was only inferior to Di Tian in the world of soul beasts. It was best not to offend the Evileye Tyrant King. It would help him avoid any unwanted trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had once swore that he wouldn’t kill another soul beast unless he was attacked. This was why he wasn’t going to provoke the Evileye Tyrant King, even though he wasn’t afraid of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual undulations continued to spread. Very soon, Huo Yuhao found his target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew his limits very well during this surveillance process. Since the Holy Ghost Church’s headquarters was in this forest, they would need resources. Furthermore, Radiant City was the core of the Sun Moon Empire. This was why their headquarters had to be closer to Radiant City if it was in this forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The forest was fraught with dangers. To avoid any danger, it was best for the headquarters to be away from the core region. As a result, he was mainly surveying the perimeter of the forest facing Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And indeed, he quickly found a lot people who were hard at work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were too obvious. They were moving too many resources out, piling them up in a plot of empty land. After this, these resources were put into spatial storage-type soul tools by specialized people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown how many such storage-type soul tools they had. After the plot of empty land was fully filled, the resources were quickly put away. After that, they started to move resources once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s first guess was that the headquarters was underground. This was because all the resources were being moved out from underground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He moved his Spiritual Detection downward. Given his current spiritual power, seeing underground was not an issue. As he ventured deeper down, he was suddenly astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of project is this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below the forest, there was a construction that was similar to a palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This underground building was more than a thousand acres wide. It was made from granite, and was furnished with all kinds of decorations, making it appear very elegant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were around a thousand people in this building right now, and most of them were busy. Among them, many were relatively weak, only having between three and six rings. However, there were still one to two hundred people with rather strong cultivations. They were commanding the weaker ones, who were moving the resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t even need to check to know that he had found the correct place. Apart from the Holy Ghost Church, who else would be so wealthy? From the resources that were being moved out, it was clear that there were rare metals, mountains of gold soul coins, and valuable treasures. Their worth was immeasurable. Although their wealth couldn’t compare to the Sun Moon Empire, they were still as rich as Shrek Academy!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These evil soul masters must have stolen and robbed all these items. Alright, this is great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he couldn’t verify this was the correct place just from these material items, Huo Yuhao’s suspicions were confirmed when he found Zhong Liwu and Feng Ling among the crowd of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan was also there. There were also many other familiar faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu was watching grimly as his people worked. He asked Nangong Wan, “Is there any news from the Supreme Elder?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not yet. She hasn’t brought back news even though she left in the morning.” Nangong Wan answered respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu furrowed his brow and said, “The last batch of resources have all been moved. Our people are also back too. Once we transport this batch, we can temporarily seal the exit. We’ll come back when we have the chance. This is the foundation of our church. We’ll definitely be back one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan nodded and replied, “We’ll definitely be back. Sect leader, when will we leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu replied without any hesitation, “We’ll immediately leave after we put everything away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan was stunned. “Aren’t we waiting for the Supreme Elder and Elder Long?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu shook his head and replied, “No. She told us not to wait for her. I wonder what she’s thinking. Since the Sun Moon Empire has already fallen out with us, why is she not instructing us to take revenge on them? Given her powers, how can they possibly stop her? I’m not afraid for her safety. We’ll leave immediately after we finish packing. Our people are our foundation. We just need to escape and accumulate our power before we’ll rise again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Nangong Wan respectfully acknowledged. Here, Zhong Liwu was the one in charge. Nangong Wan could only listen to instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Feng Ling and Zhong Liwu lifted their heads at the same time and looked into the sky. Their expressions changed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan and the other elders were slightly slower in reacting, but they also lifted their heads after a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Titled Douluo, their senses were very acute. The huge pressure that had suddenly appeared in the sky certainly caught their attention. How was it possible for them not to sense it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were frantic when they sensed the terrifying pressure. The origin of this pressure was also unknown. At many times, the unknown was the most terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At Zhong Liwu’s command, a barrier of light immediately rose, engulfing all the evil soul masters within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire wasn’t the only one with linked defensive barriers. The Holy Ghost Church had been their national church for a long time. They also had their own ways of preserving themselves. In addition, this was their headquarters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky slowly turned dark. Huge clouds started to gather. The weather seemed to turn chillier too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go up and take a look.” Feng Ling said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu pulled Feng Ling back and shook his head at her. “They are not from the Sun Moon Empire. Soul engineers can’t put this kind of pressure on us. There are very few people in the continent who can unleash such terrifying pressure. Send a distress signal.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next instant, a bright golden flame rose into the sky. After it burst in the sky, another beam of golden light shot further up into the sky. It burst too, and turned into a golden umbrella, which hung in the sky, only fading slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beam of white light descended from the sky. It wasn’t considered very strong. However, the expressions of the evil soul masters changed a little when it appeared. This was because the pressure that was being blocked by the linked defensive barrier got stronger. It was even much stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chi!” Before the linked defensive barrier could even stop the white light, it had already been penetrated. The white light struck down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu was the first to retreat. He fled far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference between the Holy Ghost Church and Shrek Academy was that everyone in the Holy Ghost Church only thought of their own safety whenever there was danger. They didn’t think of anyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A boom sounded at this moment. It was as if the ground had been torn open. A terrifying explosion caused the sky to change colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Tang Sect’s special Class 9 stationary shell, Tai Ah!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Huo Yuhao had once used this stationary shell to pierce a protective barrier in the Sun Moon Imperial Palace. How could a protective barrier by the Holy Ghost Church possibly stop it now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the barrier was penetrated, it didn’t collapse immediately. The huge explosion that ensued happened within the region of the protective barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a Titled Douluo had to fear a Class 9 stationary shell! It was the most expensive weapon in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an important reason why a soul engineer could be stronger than a soul master.</span></p>
