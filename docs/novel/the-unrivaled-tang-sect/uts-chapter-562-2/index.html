 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At their level, any simple movement was an extremely powerful attack. They simplified everything, and soul skills weren’t that important anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was still standing there, motionless. A black beam of light blasted from his chest, and Elder Xuan felt the air in front of him begin to twist and contort vigorously as he pushed out with his palm. A terrifying suction force appeared in the next moment and completely absorbed his palm’s force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Elder Xuan was startled. “Spatial power?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian said plainly, “I have been at this level for several hundred thousand years longer than you have. You are still a far cry from me in terms of your understanding in this respect. Even though soul beasts cannot become Gods because we are limited by the God Realm, no human in the Douluo Continent could ever be my match.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan grunted coldly as he placed his palms in a circle in front of his chest. The Godly Taotie Bull behind his back roared fearsomely as a dense and material sphere of dirty yellow light appeared between his palms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sphere appeared very peculiar. Its insides seemed material, but there were separate pieces floating on its surface. Every piece radiated with strange light, and some even seemed like there was water flowing between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” It was Di Tian’s turn to be surprised. “You’re recreating the Continent?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take this,” Elder Xuan said plainly, “Heaven and Earth Resonance.” He pushed his hands forward slowly, and his movement was very gradual as the yellow sphere slowly rose and flew towards Di Tian at an incredibly slow speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right at this moment, a mystical event occurred. The ground beneath them, including Shrek City, the vast plains outside the city, and even the Sun Moon Empire’s camp, began to radiate starry yellow light as they flew into the sky. The great earth and everything that the naked eye could see seemed to awaken in that moment, and those dots of yellow light emanated dense earth-type energy as they surged hysterically towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s army was already aware when those two formidable individuals rose high into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi arrived outside as her Class 9 soul engineers escorted her. The Holy Ghost Church’s powerful individuals also appeared outside with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the enormous Godly Taotie Bull that was a thousand meters long appeared behind Elder Xuan, the first person to react in shock was the Holy Ghost Church’s supreme leader, Zhongli Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ultimate Douluo? Xuan Zi of Shrek Academy’s Sea God’s Pavilion has become an Ultimate Douluo?” Zhongli Wu’s eyes were full of shock and incredulity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil soul masters did have an advantage over normal soul masters, but that advantage would cease to exist at a Transcendent Douluo’s level. Zhongli Wu was more than aware of what an Ultimate Douluo’s appearance meant for them. The Holy Ghost Church’s two Ultimate Douluo were not with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Typical soul tools couldn’t hurt Ultimate Douluo. Zhongli Wu felt for the first time that Ju Zi’s refusal to attack seemed reasonable, because Shrek Academy’s foundations were truly thick and solid. It hadn’t been long since Elder Mu’s death, and yet another Ultimate Douluo had already appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But who was his opponent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was just a black shadow, and he didn’t show his aura. Everyone from the Sun Moon Empire was speculating who could oppose an Ultimate Douluo. Who could that be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi frowned, as she didn’t know what was happening either. An Ultimate Douluo had appeared in Shrek Academy, and that was big news. Furthermore, he had an opponent, and it appeared like both parties were about to fight it out. That was strange. If both Ultimate Douluo belonged to Shrek Academy, then her plan would probably run into trouble. Ultimate Douluo were symbols of eternity and invincibility, so Ju Zi’s camp would probably be in trouble if an Ultimate Douluo was bent on causing destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, as those tiny, compact yellow spots began rising from the earth, Zhongli Wu’s expression changed drastically as he looked on. Zhongli Wu was a Transcendent Douluo, and he understood what this meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuan Zi hasn’t just become an Ultimate Douluo. He has also grasped his martial soul’s true power. This is a cosmic phenomenon that happens when a soul master feeds his martial soul back to heaven and earth. He’s using such a formidable attack from the get-go. Who exactly is his opponent?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky suddenly darkened at this moment. Elder Xuan’s yellow radiance had lit up the sky, but now the horizon was starting to turn dark and gloomy. A bright dragon roar could be heard as an enormous dragon head appeared from behind the black shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This large dragon head was also more than a thousand meters tall like Elder Xuan’s Godly Taotie Bull, but the dragon head was much more material and condensed, like an actual dragon had descended upon the world. But even a real dragon wouldn’t have such a massive size!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shadows flickered as the dragon descended upon the world, and terrifying auras rippled outward. Purplish-black rays of light dripped from the sky like raindrops, and these rays naturally broke apart after falling to a certain height into circles of dark purple light. They blocked the yellow light dots which were rising from the ground, and didn’t allow a single dot to rise into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can Dragon Uncle be here? This is the Black Dragon. Can it be Uncle’s Darkness Holy Dragon? But…” Zhongli Wu was both surprised and confused, but he quickly realized that this wasn’t right, because he could see a pair of golden eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, that’s not Dragon Uncle. That, that is… that’s the Beast God, Di Tian, the Golden Eyes Black Dragon King, the most powerful individual in the world, the Great Star Dou Forest’s dictator. It’s the Beast God, Di Tian!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire fell silent when that was spoken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they knew that the Great Star Dou Forest’s soul beasts would never get involved in a war between humans, the Beast God’s reputation was just too famous. He was already known as the most powerful individual in the world today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back at the Ming Dou Mountain Range, the Death God Douluo didn’t have any advantage at all against Huo Yuhao when he drew upon the Beast God’s strength through his reverse scale. It wasn’t hard to see exactly how formidable the Beast God was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in this moment, that black shadow in the sky was evidently not a projection of the Beast God; the Beast God was actually here. It was no wonder that Elder Xuan, who was an Ultimate Douluo, would give his full strength from the very beginning, and he had to use his strongest abilities to fight him. Who would dare to hold back against the Beast God?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying auras resonated through the heavens, and the Sun Moon Empire could feel shivers running down their spines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a hysterical voice shouting in Zhongli Wu’s heart. The Beast God was acting out against Shrek City, so what did that mean? That meant their opportunity had arrived! If the Beast God could break the city, then their plan of not staging an offensive was no longer important. Shrek City would undoubtedly crumble when that happened, and nobody could resist that temptation under such circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no matter how intense that voice was in his head, Zhongli Wu couldn’t say a single word as he stood there, because the overbearing pressure from the sky was filling him with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was pressure from the most powerful individual in the world, pressure from the Beast God!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful individuals were powerful individuals after all. When the Sun Moon Empire heard that the black shadow in the sky was the Beast God, Di Tian, their first reaction was to retreat subconsciously instead of taking this opportunity to attack Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s clear and cold voice rang out in this moment. “Pass my order: all soul tool fronts, prepare. Charge all long-range linked offensive soul tools and prepare to fire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her voice was soft, but she announced her orders through a loudspeaker so that every soul engineer around could hear her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those soul engineers who were startled and frightened seemed to quiver before they came to. Even Zhongli Wu felt a little shameful, because not even he could match up to a little girl at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he quickly explained this away to himself, because the unknowing wasn’t guilty. She definitely didn’t know how powerful the Beast God was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heavens and the earth transformed into a beautiful and spectacular sight. Purplish-black and yellow colors that were filled with dots of energy intertwined and fought against each other, while Elder Xuan’s sphere came closer and closer to Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian stared at Elder Xuan coldly. “Do you really wish to fight to the death, Xuan Zi? You should know that Shrek Academy can’t possibly defend themselves against those enemy forces outside without you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian wouldn’t participate in a war between humans, but that didn’t mean he didn’t know what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said plainly, “I’m not the one who wishes to fight to my last breath. You are provoking us, and I am Shrek Academy’s guardian. How can I sit by and watch? You don’t have to be rejoicing at our predicament. How is Shrek Academy’s destruction any good for the Great Star Dou Forest? The Sun Moon Empire is very powerful. Let me ask you, if the Sun Moon Empire truly conquers the entire Continent some day, will they ignore and overlook the Great Star Dou Forest’s soul beasts? When that happens, the great forest will simply be the Sun Moon Empire’s backyard. They will take whatever soul rings they wish. When that happens, not even you will be able to do anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve got some balls!” Di Tian exclaimed furiously as he punched out with his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Eyes Black Dragon King’s shadow roared fearsomely as he punched out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan didn’t show any weakness at all. His eyes turned crystal yellow, and the Godly Taotie Bull behind his back charged forward and clashed with the Black Dragon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan had triggered the Godly Taotie Bull’s Taotie bloodline with Elder Mu’s help when he last battled the Beast God. He managed to swallow Di Tian with his Taotie, so that he couldn’t participate in the beast wave, and that bought Shrek Academy sufficient time. But now, Elder Xuan had become an Ultimate Douluo. It was a pity that he couldn’t use his own strength to trigger his Taotie’s true power.</span></p>
