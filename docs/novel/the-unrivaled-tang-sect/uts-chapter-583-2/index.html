 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was floating in mid-air as he waited for Liao Mengkai's arrival.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person did not unleash his martial soul!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something Huo Yuhao had accurately determined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, even soul engineers would first unleash their martial souls in battle to either strengthen or support their attacks. At the end of the day, any kind of boost would be better than nothing. Huo Yuhao had only seen one other person who relied purely on his soul power and soul tool. That person was none other than Ji Juechen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was able to tell that this person was treading on a different path from Ji Juechen. If he was planning to attack in a similar way as Ji Juechen, he would not have his human-shaped soul tool. His blades would have sufficed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light from his matte black blades intersected each other in the air as they formed a cross that sped towards Huo Yuhao. The sharpness of his blades gave off the impression that the cross would be unstoppable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao raised the Morning Dew Dagger in his hand as the blade of the dagger instantly released an icy blue glow. The glow stabbed right into the center of the cross.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The matte black light from the blades paused before turning white. Following which, they disintegrated into the air like the morning mist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liao Mengkai's heart sank after watching this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was one thing to spectate Huo Yuhao's battle with the five evil soul masters, and another thing to be up against him in person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liao Mengkai could not seem to sense any pressure from Huo Yuhao's body. It was almost as though he did not have any aura at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this only served to put more pressure on Liao Mengkai. After all, he had seen how Huo Yuhao had taken down five Transcendent Douluo consecutively with his own eyes! The thought of going up against someone like Huo Yuhao crushed his morale as his battle intent weakened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the first probing collision ended, Liao Mengkai appeared before Huo Yuhao at the very next moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had positioned one of his blades to the front and the other to his back as he slashed both of them towards Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul engineers rarely used their martial soul true body, as it would affect the effects of their soul tools. However, it was even more rare to see people like him, who did not even unleash his own martial soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharp light from his blades was easily parried by Huo Yuhao's Morning Dew Dagger. At the same time, Huo Yuhao lifted his land hand as a streak of dark blue sword light came towards Liao Mengkai.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unparalleled Chill, Empress' Sword!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liao Mengkai was the only person who could sense the chill that was traveling down his spine. Huo Yuhao had long been able to concentrate his Ultimate Ice after understanding the intricacies of the element of ice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liao Mengkai's figure flickered as his entire body became a little illusory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Poof!" A soft sound could be heard as the Unparalleled Chill turned the black figure into an ice sculpture before the sculpture started to fall from the sky. However, another black figure had appeared on the other side of Huo Yuhao as it surged towards him with its brightly illuminated blade.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao moved his body and teleported away instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the black figure also vanished at that very instant. In addition, Huo Yuhao found himself unable to locate the person's position even with his Spiritual Detection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Huh?"&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could this be…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was visibly startled by what he had just witnessed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Until now, Liao Mengkai had not even unleashed his martial soul. Hence, his teleportation ability must have been granted to him by a soul tool.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could the human-shaped soul tool he is wearing now possess the ability to teleport? No, it can't be this simple. From the look of things, it’s almost as if he completely vanished. It's not the same as teleportation. This means that his human-shaped soul tool must possess some sort of ability which is very similar to spatial power. That would be insane!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao was trying to understand Liao Mengkai's power, a figure had suddenly appeared behind him. The figure was wielding a black blade which was giving off a menacing black glow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Huo Yuhao had been enveloping the entire battlefield with his Spiritual Detection, he was able to react instantly. The Icy War God’s Armor immediately emitted a layer of dark blue light. When that matte black blade glow came near the Icy War God’s Armor, it was almost as if it had sunk into a marsh. It instantly stopped as an extremely cold aura immediately attacked the black figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The effects of Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice were always present. Even though he had become a lot more conservative with it, and had not released his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice again, he was still able to unleash the power of Ultimate Ice on his opponent by just activating his intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without hesitating at all, the black light flickered, and Liao Mengkai vanished again. In that short instant, Huo Yuhao’s Morning Dew Dagger was about to stab into Liao Mengkai, but he vanished in the nick of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was exactly how assassins liked to fight. After failing to land their blows, they would immediately retreat to prepare for their next blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao was able to instantly understand what Liao Mengkai wanted to do. It appeared that Liao Mengkai had the same plan as Zhongli Wu. Both of them wanted to expend his power. They wanted to use their various methods to burn his spiritual power and soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a good move!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a cold smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It might be very demanding for me to deal with Zhongli Wu. But do you really think it will be demanding for me to deal with you? A soul engineer who has not even reached Rank 95? You might have a human-shaped soul tool, but I have one too. On top of that, there are some things I have which you do not possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gradually raised the Morning Dew Dagger in his hand until it rose above his head. The dark blue glow on the Icy War God’s Armor suddenly weakened before it intensified and illuminated the area around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After sensing this extremely intense cold, Liao Mengkai, who had just reappeared next to Huo Yuhao, immediately went back into the void without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao slashed his Morning Dew Dagger outwards. At that instant, no one could see exactly what he was doing. His entire body was like a dark blue ball of light, where countless streaks of light were radiating from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, everything within a thousand meters of him was enveloped in a piercing blade light. The icy blue light ripped apart all space easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was obviously an indiscriminate attack. Even when he was up against Zhongli Wu, Huo Yuhao had not unleashed such an attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of technique is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Ji Juechen was not present. If not, the sword fanatic would definitely bug Huo Yuhao to spar with him after this battle. He would not have cared even if he were to lose. After Huo Yuhao had unleashed this technique, the entire sky had changed color, and now revealed a radiant picture. It was as though a gigantic icy blue dragon was flying in the sky. Every single scale on the dragon’s body was immensely clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this something a sword technique is supposed to be able to achieve?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone from Tang Sect was startled by what they had just witnessed. None of them knew when exactly Huo Yuhao had mastered this technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, this technique did not belong to the Douluo Continent! It was passed on to Huo Yuhao by a God!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rain Dragon’s Dance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Huo Yuhao was using this technique on the battlefield. At the instant he unleashed this technique, he felt as though the soul power stored within his Yin Yang Complement soul cores was being gulped down furiously by the Morning Dew Dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black figure was forced out from his hiding spot within the void as Liao Mengkai frantically waved his blades before him to protect himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, he could not help but sustain thirteen cuts on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Class 9 protective soul barrier was shattered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His invincible barrier was also shattered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could also see the streaks of icy blue light that were left on his human-shaped soul tool. The piercing cold instantly penetrated his human-shaped soul tool and went straight into his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though his human-shaped soul tool was also Class 9, its defensive ability could not be compared to the frightening power of the Morning Dew Dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The formation arrays within the Class 9 human-shaped soul tool were instantly destroyed by the blade light. If he had not been wearing an additional suit of Class 9 inner armor, he would have turned into an ice sculpture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was frightening—simply too frightening. What kind of dagger technique could shred space over two thousand meters? Huo Yuhao was somehow able to restrain himself, and only use it now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How many trump cards does he actually possess?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The powerful soul engineers and soul masters from the Sun Moon Empire could not help but tremble as they watched Huo Yuhao unleash that technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they did not know that he was also regretting what he had just done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Rain Dragon’s Dance was able to startle everyone, it demanded too much from him. He realized how much soul power he had lost just because of that technique. Even the powerful regenerative ability of the Yin Yang Complement soul cores was not able to compensate for the soul power he had spent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took almost thirty seconds before the sky started to lose its peculiar appearance after it was carved and torn into the shape of a dragon. Now, the sky had turned into a sea of Ultimate Ice. It was clear how much soul power Huo Yuhao had expended to achieve this feat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” A loud howl escaped from Liao Mengkai’s mouth. Following which, two long matte black blades were released in Huo Yuhao’s direction. They sped towards him like lightning, while Liao Mengkai started to drop towards the ground from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew there was only one reason why a person would toss out his or her weapon in the middle of a battle. This was because the person wanted to create an opportunity to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though a Class 9 soul engineer might not be able to match a top-class soul master when it came to fighting power, their ability to survive was definitely a lot stronger than that of a soul master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were a soul master with an equal or even higher cultivation than Liao Mengkai who was on the receiving end of Huo Yuhao's Rain Dragon's Dance, he or she would have already been shredded to pieces. However, Liao Mengkai was still alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two matte black blades instantly appeared before Huo Yuhao one after another. The blades were staggered by a single meter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A serious look immediately formed on Huo Yuhao's face. In fact, from his first battle until now, he had not revealed an expression this serious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao raised his Morning Dew Dagger to deflect the first black blade. Following which, he did something which no one was unable to understand. He tilted his body slightly as he used his left shoulder to take on the attack of the second blade.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Tskk!" The long blade pierced through his shoulder instantly. Even the powerful defensive ability of the Icy War God's Armor was unable to block the blade.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao' shoulder did not seem to be bleeding. He simply stumbled before he fell from the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong immediately panicked after seeing him fall. She was about to dash over to catch him when she saw him raise his right hand and signal her not to come over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, two loud thuds could be heard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liao Mengkai and Huo Yuhao had crashed into the ground one after another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Liao Mengkai landed, his body fell forward in an unsightly manner before he rolled over into a sitting position. On the other hand, Huo Yuhao landed in an extremely steady manner. However, the blade in his shoulder made him look very frightening.</span></p>
