 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Deep meditation?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Everyone from the Tang Sect was stunned when they heard those words. Several hundred people in deep meditation at the same time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei laughed. He was always so refined and elegant, and he rarely expressed too much happiness or anger, but there was clearly excitement in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t misspeak, and you guys heard that right. Everyone went into deep meditation, and those who came to earliest only did so at daybreak. Some of those who have woken up have told me that their entire bodies feel very smooth and clear, while many of their impurities have been expelled. I conducted a simple checkup on them, and discovered that their soul power hasn’t improved much, but their martial soul’s quality seems to have improved, while their bodies have become stronger. Those who have woken up are the Tang Sect’s weakest disciples, and they are comparatively less talented. That also means that the more talented you are, the longer you will be in deep meditation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone exchanged glances, and incredulity flickered in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was deep meditation? That was a state that every soul master dreamed of achieving, and a single episode of deep meditation could bring realizations and understanding that was more important than cultivating for several years. Deep cultivation was a process which would directly give a deep understanding of one’s martial soul, soul power, and soul skills. It was just like sudden enlightenment, as a sudden enlightenment boosted one’s potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, Huo Yuhao had an extremely long episode of deep meditation back at the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. Even though that episode was long, it didn’t really boost his soul power, but it was that episode that consolidated his foundation as one of the elites of the younger generation. From that, one could see how important deep meditation was for soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an improvement of one’s talents! However, several hundred soul masters going through deep meditation at the same time was an event that had never happened before across the Douluo Continent’s entire history. Something like that was impossible to imagine, but everything was clearly happening because of the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s medicinal aroma.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the pill’s medicinal aroma could produce such immense effects, so how intense would the effects of the pill itself be? Everyone’s eyes began to burn with passion inside the conference hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crystal bottle was brought out and filled to the brim with clear water, while over a dozen smaller cups were taken out at the same time. Bei Bei nodded in Huo Yuhao’s direction and said, “Let’s begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. He took out the jade bottle that contained the Qiankun Fortune Pills as everyone looked on passionately. Once he opened the bottle, a strange aroma wafted out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fragrance wasn’t thick, but it was extremely penetrative. Everyone could smell it as soon as it was released, and a feeling that numbed their skulls surfaced as they felt like all their pores had been opened in the next moment. It was a very comfortable and relaxing sensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pill itself was white and lustrous, and there seemed to be clouds drifting around inside it, as if the pill itself contained life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao covered the jade bottle and placed a single Qiankun Fortune Pill into the crystal bottle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crystal bottle also had a cap. Huo Yuhao immediately covered the bottle with its cap after tossing in the pill so that its medicinal effects wouldn’t dissipate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange scene occurred once the Qiankun Fortune Pill fell into the water. The originally clear and still water began to boil and roil, and everything inside it became foggy and cloudy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white fog gradually turned golden, and then an even stranger thing happened. Scenes that reflected the sun and moon’s glory seemed to flash and flicker within the golden liquid, and the crystal bottle radiated with intense and brilliant light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone exchanged looks, and nobody could hide the bedazzlement in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was the person who had crafted the pill, and he couldn’t help but take a deep breath before he said, “The Qiankun Fortune Pill does live up to its claim of containing the good fortune of heaven and earth. From my perspective, I think we have done this right by accident. With its medicinal effects, we may not be able to handle it if we had taken one pill each. At least, we absolutely cannot ingest one pill in one go. Otherwise, we might run into big trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From when Bei Bei was talking about the Tang Sect’s disciples going through deep meditation together to the strange scenes that they were witnessing from the Qiankun Fortune Pill now, everyone could see its frightening medicinal powers. Nobody expected that a tiny pill like that could possess such forceful and terrifying effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used his spiritual power to observe, and only reopened the bottle after the golden liquid inside the crystal bottle had completely settled down. He poured the liquid equally into all the little cups that had been taken out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, perhaps because the pill had been dissolved into water, its fragrance was more than ten times denser than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hurry and drink it. Don’t let its medicinal effects dissipate,” Huo Yuhao immediately reminded everyone after pouring everything out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone no longer dared to delay as they took their respective cups and finished the fluid in one gulp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fluid was plain and tasteless, and it didn’t seem that much different from drinking clear water. But before anyone could start guessing or sensing the changes to their body, everyone felt a wave of burning heat rising up and coursing over their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people here belonged to the Tang Sect’s inner circle, and they were naturally different from the other disciples. The individual with the lowest cultivation rank was a Soul Emperor, while they were also prepared before ingesting the fluid. They immediately sat down and crossed their legs one by one and began to meditate in an attempt to catalyze the medicinal effects with their soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they realized after sitting down that they didn’t have to catalyze anything at all. The medicinal effects reached every corner of their bodies after releasing itself, and the terrifying medicinal powers barged around through their passageways forcibly. Everyone could see a patch of gold when they looked inside themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya was the only one who didn’t drink. But she could smell the dense medicinal aroma in the air, and even though she was weak, she could still feel that refreshing and comfortable sensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, she could observe most clearly because she was an onlooker. A golden hue appeared over everyone’s bodies after they ingested the fluid. That golden color wasn’t soul power. Instead, it was a kind of air flow that seemed very obscure and faint. The medicinal aroma inside the conference hall didn’t dampen because they had consumed the medicinal fluids, but became denser instead, like everyone’s bodies couldn’t hold back the medicinal fragrance. This time, the aroma was emanating from everyone’s bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such powerful medicinal effects! This was a single Qiankun Fortune Pill split into more than a dozen servings, and even then, it still possessed such intense effects. Tang Ya couldn’t help but draw in a cold breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei had already told her that Huo Yuhao had decided to give one of the pills to her, but now, that decision didn’t seem very realistic. Tang Ya knew that her body was weak, and if she took one pill all by herself, she would probably be so weak that the pill would make her much worse! Fortunately, everyone else went ahead to try the pill’s effects before she had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could feel his soul power roiling in his body. He and Tang Wutong had the highest cultivation rank among everyone here besides Xuan Ziwen, the soul engineer. The truth was, in terms of how pure their soul power was and in terms of total volume, Huo Yuhao probably even surpassed Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the reason why what he felt was the most vivid. The medicinal fluid almost didn’t stop when it entered his body, and it began to spread from his abdomen. Huo Yuhao immediately felt like his soul power began to undulate and spurt like a geyser from the pill’s effects. The soul power inside his passageways, his skeleton, and his organs began to turn a pure gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao could still maintain clarity in his mind in this moment. Even though the formidable medicinal strength was stimulating him to the point where he almost couldn’t move, he still managed to spin around as soon as possible while he pulled Tang Wutong’s hands up and placed their palms together. Haodong power naturally began to circulate between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strangely, the initially intense medicinal effects immediately settled down when they began to channel Haodong power, just like tidal waves from a large surging river suddenly flowing into the boundless ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their expressions immediately became relaxed. The medicinal effects were still strong, but there seemed to be a special force inside their Haodong power that could suppress the medicinal effects instead of allowing them to spread completely and wreak havoc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was experiencing a very special sensation. He felt like the Qiankun Fortune Pill was a catalyzer, a catalyzer for soul power. Tang Wutong and his soul power was improving at a surprising speed under the effects of this catalyzer, resembling the rising of the tide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, their soul power wasn’t the only thing that was changing; even their spirits were being nourished along with their passageways. Their bodies became smooth and clear, while there were already very few impurities within their bodies. In this moment, the Qiankun Fortune Pill made them feel like their entire body was transparent, and that purest and most direct improvement caused a faint smile to appear on both their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The medicine’s effects were absorbed extremely quickly, but because their passageways were also being refined by the pill, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t feel any swelling in their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire process took but fifteen minutes, while the pill’s effects were almost completely absorbed. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong realized to their pleasant surprise that their soul power rank had clearly improved a lot, by a difference of almost two ranks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single Qiankun Fortune Pill was split into more than ten different servings, while their cultivation were already past 80! Furthermore, improving their soul power was secondary, while strengthening their own bodies was absolutely beneficial for becoming a Titled Douluo in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They opened their eyes at the same time, as if by telepathy. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong looked at each other, and they could see the joy in each other’s eyes. Huo Yuhao’s soul power had almost reached Rank 83 after the previous four months of hard work and assiduous cultivation before consuming the medicinal fluid, while Tang Wutong’s situation was similar to his.</span></p>
