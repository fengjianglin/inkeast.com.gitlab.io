 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It turned out that he no longer needed a flying-type soul tool after gaining his second soul core. As for his speed limit, Huo Yuhao gave that an attempt too. He was definitely faster than supersonic speed. Once he reached a certain speed, he felt that he was able to break through space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only now that he realized that the Beast God’s ability to transcend space wasn’t very special. It was achievable once his speed reached a certain extreme, and once he was able to understand the mysteries of space. He couldn’t do so now, but he would find a way to do it in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The formation of his second soul core opened a new door for him. The existence of this door also gave him the opportunity to work towards the peak of this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He soon covered fifty kilometers just as he was silently comprehending everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let all types of soul tools scan his body, but he wasn’t afraid of being discovered. This was because he was like a part of the air right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Beast God couldn’t do this, as he didn’t have Imitation. After forming his second soul core, Huo Yuhao’s Imitation had also reached a peak. It was no longer just simply imitating. It was more like a transformation. He could transform into anything he wanted to, including air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The destruction caused in the day could still be seen. Watching from the sky, it was clear that one entire region was completely empty. Even from the sky, Huo Yuhao could still sense the aura of darkness and Ultimate Ice coming from that section. This plot of land would take a long time to neutralize these forces. Before they were neutralized, no living matter could survive here. Even any living organism above it was affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was unleashed like a huge web. The entire Sun Moon Empire camp was covered. Very soon, Huo Yuhao found who he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He drifted down and landed in the base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was distracted in her seat at this moment. There was an uncertain look in her eyes. One couldn’t blame her for feeling this way. She was still very confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the day, she had watched as Di Tian stuck Huo Yuhao with a sword. That was also a very key reason why she was determined to attack the Beast God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything that had happened afterward was under her control. The only thing she was unsure about was how Huo Yuhao was. He actually clashed against the Beast God. Although he was much stronger than he was before, would the Beast God’s attack have left him with serious injuries?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can I enter?” A clear voice sounded from outside, which caused Ju Zi to lift her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is it?” After she asked, she subconsciously covered her mouth. This was because she realized that the voice didn’t come from outside the tent, but was ringing inside her head</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whoosh whoosh!” A few figures quickly dashed into the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal, what’s going on?” The people who entered were all dressed in fiery-red human-shaped soul tools. They were members of the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the five soul engineer legions in the Hand that Protects the Nation, only Ju Zi’s thirty bodyguards, the team and vice-team leaders of the respective soul engineer legions, and the entire Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion were equipped with human-shaped soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These guards that were standing guard outside Ju Zi’s tent were all elites among the elites in the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi waved her hand and said, “Nothing. I might have heard wrongly earlier. All of you can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” While the guards were a little perplexed, they still retreated after performing a simple check of the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi returned to her seat and sat down. She gently pressed her right hand to her chair handle. Around the tent, a spiritual barrier silently went off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that short period of time earlier, she had already known whose voice that was.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is he here? Is he really here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju Zi.” The voice sounded once again. Ju Zi was stunned. She subconsciously covered her mouth. This was because she was astonished to discover that Huo Yuhao had appeared in front of her without any warning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Ju Zi was in a daze. Before she could even open her mouth, Huo Yuhao had already pulled her over with one hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, countless images surfaced in Ju Zi’s head. She subconsciously wanted to grab the handle on the other side. However, she stopped after her hand moved slightly. Huo Yuhao wasn’t restraining her. Instead, she stopped of her own accord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sorrowful feeling surged in her heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is he finally going to make a move on me? Has he made up his mind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi mocked herself and shut her eyes. She had many tricks up her sleeve to deal with Huo Yuhao. The tent was full of traps. If she used the installations in the tent to stop Huo Yuhao for even a moment, she was confident that someone would come to save her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she didn’t do so. Rather, she didn’t do anything. At this instant, she even felt as if the shackles on her had been removed. Dying under his hands was probably the best relief that she could get.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao placed his hand on Ju Zi’s shoulder. Following this, a pitch-black door appeared behind him. Lights flashed, and both he and Ju Zi vanished into that door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi only felt that her soul had left her body. Everything around her distorted, but there was a weird force protecting her. Nothing in the outside world could touch her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And then, everything returned to normal. Ju Zi’s legs shook, and she found her footing again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything around her brightened up. The air was slightly cold and sinister. When Ju Zi opened her eyes, she discovered that she was on a little mountain with Huo Yuhao. Not far from this mountain was a huge base. There were many soul engineers training there. The lighting here was also dimmer than usual, like it was night time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was shocked as she asked Huo Yuhao, “Where are we?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “This is my place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your place?” Ju Zi was curious. She wasn’t afraid of dying in Huo Yuhao’s arms. Right now, she wasn’t fearful at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked a little cheekily, “Do you really think I’ll tell you the secret of this place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi shook her head and said, “Whatever. Why did you bring me here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed slightly, “For no reason. We are friends. I only invited you here as a guest. Can’t I do that? Let’s go and get a cup of tea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he proceeded in the direction of the base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi stomped the ground. Although she didn’t know what was going on, she still followed him. For some reason, she felt that she would be in grave danger if she left his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi wasn’t wearing any armor right now, only a red dress. It seemed like she was a young but rich lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal!” The soldiers all came up to greet Huo Yuhao when they saw him. They were all delightfully surprised to see him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and the others from the Tang Sect had been gone for some time without returning. Although there was food and water here, they were still very lonely. The three soul engineer legions were loving the war against the Sun Moon Empire. It was truly exciting. Furthermore, they were also very happy to plunder the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also their first time seeing Ju Zi. When they saw her, they appeared very playful. Although Ju Zi wasn’t as pretty as Tang Wutong, she had a very special aura about her. This left a deep impression on others, especially her delicate skin. These soul engineers unwittingly took another few glances at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao brought Ju Zi to where he stayed in the base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Ju Zi kept on following him, she was still observing everything around her. Since she hadn’t died, everything here was very important to her. Being observant had become a habit that she followed in her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t bother her, and didn’t stop her either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering his room, someone delivered tea and some snacks. After this period of restructuring, this base was already very similar one on to the Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please, enjoy some tea.” Huo Yuhao raised his own teacup and took a sip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi didn’t move, only silently sat and watched.</span></p>

I’m always in touch with the most senior officials in the Sun Moon Empire, especially their top soul engineers. In terms of my experience, I’m not lacking compared to others. It’s just that I don’t believe you can control such a big plot of space, given your abilities. This isn’t just ordinary spatial power anymore. Even Di Tian couldn’t possibly create an entire plane that belongs to him. I understand everything now. The sneak attacks on the Sun Moon Empire were indeed committed by you. With such a plane and your flying speed, you can indeed appear in any corner of the Sun Moon Empire. No wonder you were so difficult to deal with. Even His Majesty was hurt by your attack.”</span></p>
