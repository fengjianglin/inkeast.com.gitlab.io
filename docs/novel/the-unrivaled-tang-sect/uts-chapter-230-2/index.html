Its speed soared as it targeted Zhang Lexuan. Evidently, it had a lot of hatred for her. It even understood that Zhang Lexuan was the leader of this team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Baboon King was very different after it entered the Bloodlust state. As it burst forward, it left a blood-red wake behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before it, a full moon shone, and a streak of silver light shot down towards the Baboon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Baboon King glared. As it roared furiously, it punched its fist out and forcefully crushed the moonlight that was descending towards it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it unleashed its fist, Huo Yuhao could clearly sense that its attack resembled a soul masters’ offense when they combined their spiritual and soul power. It wasn’t a skill, but an innate ability. It was the combination of a Bloody Baboon’s maniacal fighting will and fighting strength as it entered the Bloodlust state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan’s eyes shone with silver light. Her first, second, and third soul rings lit up at the same time. The full moon in the air was like a soul tool shooting out soul rays, streaks of moonlight were fired continuously, all targeting the Bloody Baboon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Baboon King seemed to have gone mad too. Although it was unable to charge forward as quickly as before, it still advanced with solid steps. As it moved forward, it destroyed a streak of moonlight every time it waved its fist. Even when the streaks of moonlight struck it, they only reduced its speed, and couldn’t force it back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, all the Bloody Baboons in the Bloodlust state started to attack all-out. Their speed, strength, offense, and defense were all greatly enhanced by their Bloodlust state, and they all rushed up the slope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo was undoubtedly the one under the greatest pressure. Her golden halo was put to use again. However, it couldn’t topple the baboons like before. The baboons could only be pushed back slightly. Following that, more and more baboons continued to rush up the slope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s performance was the most eye-catching. The baboons’ Bloodlust didn’t seem to have any effect on her. Her fighting style was also very uncouth and violent. Her body was completely engulfed by golden light. As dragon roars echoed, every baboon that collided with her was flung into the air. She guarded her area so well that it was seemingly impregnable. Not far from her was the baboon corpse that Huo Yuhao had previously grabbed with his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s Hexagram Array also started to take effect. The Hexagram Array sent two baboons into the air the moment it was activated. They screamed pathetically amidst the fiery light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each Hexagram Array only lasted for about ten seconds before it would change locations and rise again. The magical thing was that the baboon’s Bloodlust state would be lost once they were burned by the fiery light. It was as if they were being cleansed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, everyone was still under great pressure. There were simply too many baboons in the Bloodlust state, attacking ceaselessly. Han Ruoruo’s soul power was also being depleted quickly as she kept on using her golden halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huo Yuhao finally acted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A white halo that was much stronger than before started to spread from his head. The bodies of the baboons were covered by a layer of pale-white light as the halo passed them, repressing their auras considerably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white light from the Eye of Destiny was retracted. In the next moment, a purplish-gold light surfaced within it. The purplish-gold glow in the Eye of Destiny flashed once before disappearing. Suddenly, the Bloody Baboon King screamed in horror. It grabbed onto its head and shrieked in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan exploited this opportunity. Her sixth soul ring suddenly lit up, and it rose into the air before fusing with the full moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The full moon transformed – its original silvery-white color turned dim. Following that, it turned completely black, with a ringlike layer of silver surrounding it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, a silvery halo descended from the sky. Huo Yuhao could feel that it wasn’t actually a silver halo, it was just that the light that it contained was black, making it nigh-invisible in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the black light flashed, it struck the Baboon King, who had been hurt by the Eye of Destiny’s Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Baboon King’s body stiffened. Following this, a streak of moonlight shot straight down from the sky and engulfed its body. A frightening explosion occured, and the Baboon King collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection lost its detection abilities in that direction. He only saw moonlight crashing down after the black light. After that, he couldn’t see clearly. The Bloody Baboon King had already been blown apart and collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a huge stab wound around half a meter in diameter in the center of the Baboon King’s chest. Its body had been pierced through. More terrifyingly, its hair had turned silver, and was melting at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What soul skill was this? It was extremely strong. Huo Yuhao suspected that the effect of this strike wouldn’t change much even without the aid of his Spiritual Shock! Zhang Lexuan was extremely strong. At this point, neither Zhang Lexuan nor Han Ruoruo had unleashed their Martial Soul True Bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan remained calm as she looked at the Baboon King that had collapsed. In mid-air, the black moon had turned into a silver moon again. Streaks of bright silver light descended from the sky and flung the baboons into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were any other soul beast tribe, the death of the king would cause a large drop in morale, and might even cause the rest to retreat. However, the baboons were in their Bloodlust state, and were far too bloodthirsty now, their intensity didn’t waver at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ruoruo, come on! It’s not early anymore,” Zhang Lexuan said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” Han Ruoruo acknowledged. In the next moment, her body also turned bright-golden. Dazzling Golden True Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless strips of Dazzling Golden Ropes started to extend in all directions. Following this, the ground turned golden, and Han Ruoruo disappeared. However, the ground of the dense forest was shaking tremendously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The baboons seemed to have stepped into a swamp, finding it difficult to move forward. Following this, streaks of golden light shot out from the ground and sent their bodies into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden Skysurge! It was Han Ruoruo’s eighth soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, there were around a hundred baboons left. They were all sent into the air by Han Ruoruo’s Golden Skysurge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this, the bright moon in the sky expanded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan’s body turned silvery-white. The burning white light illuminated her surroundings. In the sky, the bright moon expanded at a terrifyingly quick speed. It reached more than a hundred meters instantly, and engulfed all the baboons that had been thrown into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Moonlight!” Li Yongyue exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, everyone from Shrek Academy felt their surroundings turning blurry-white. Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection lost its effect underneath this terrifying white light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gold from the Golden Skysurge and the silvery-white from the Moonlight fused together completely. A bright radiance lasted for close to five seconds before it faded away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Plop, plop, plop, plop…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of heavy impacts sounded out. When everyone regained their vision, they saw many Bloody Baboon corpses falling from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No, they should be called Silvery-white Baboons instead. The hair of every baboon had turned silvery-white, while their bodies were slowly but steadily melting.</span></p>

Her expression was calm, as if nothing had happened. This fight didn’t seem to have taken much of a toll on her at all.</span></p>

Is there anyone who needs and can absorb its soul ring? Its Bloodlust is rather effective for close-combat soul engineers. The Mass Berserk isn’t too bad, either. Furthermore, it’ll be good for your body if you absorb its soul ring. Your strength, tenacity, and defense will all be enhanced.” Zhang Lexuan seemed to have just performed something insignificant. She first overcame the obstacle before explaining the use of this Bloody Baboon King.</span></p>

Can I absorb this Bloody Baboon King?” He was confident in his own physical strength. He had twin martial souls, and now had more than nine soul rings in total. His was much stronger physically than most other Soul Kings. After he fused with the Snow Empress’ Spirit, his spiritual power also became a part of why his body was so resilient. He had confidence in absorbing a fifty-thousand year soul ring. Moreover, Wang Dong’er could protect him as he did so!</span></p>
