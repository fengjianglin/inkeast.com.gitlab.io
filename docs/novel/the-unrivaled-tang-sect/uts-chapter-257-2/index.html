 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er replied, “That looked like the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was taken aback. “Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes? What’s that?” He had learned about many plants during his lessons at Shrek Academy, as some soul beasts existed as plants, but he had never heard of this one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er stared at him with solemn eyes and said, “You are right about one thing; these poisonous clouds do have life, and this life originates from those flowers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thought crossed Huo Yuhao’s mind as he asked, “Are you saying that these bluish-green flowers are plant-type soul beasts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er nodded and said, “At least some of them are.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes is one of the most poisonous plants in the world. Its toxins contain acute corrosive acid, and it’s known as the number-one corrosive toxin, while also containing an extremely powerful neurological poison. Coming into contact with it will cause the physical body to decay, and one will also have to withstand intense pain and suffering. However, this flower is also very rare and precious, and it’s possibly every plant-type soul master’s dream. If plant-type soul masters can find a Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes that has already become a plant-type soul beast, and assimilate it as their own soul ring, then that soul master will possess the flower’s intense venom. You’ve already seen how powerful that poison can be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes widened, and his jaw hung slack. “Are you telling me that this area that is at least a kilometer wide and possibly stretches around the entire valley is filled with these Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes soul beasts? There are so many of them, yet they can still be considered an endangered species?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s eyebrows were locked together as she said, “I am also very surprised at this fact, and that’s also why I didn’t tell you about it in the beginning. According to what I remember, the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes likes to live in groups, but their reproductive capabilities are terrible. They have strict requirements for their environment, and they have to absorb immense amounts of nutrients to sustain themselves during their growth process. Not all the flowers that we just saw have evolved into soul beasts, but most of them have already completed the evolution process. Otherwise, how could they control so much of the bluish-green toxic clouds to attack us?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think you noticed that some of their leaves were shaped like human hands with nine fingers. This species is known as the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Nine Absolutes, and that means they have evolved to become plant-type soul beasts. Furthermore, this flower also belongs to a superior level in the world of plants, and has at least ten thousand years of cultivation when they evolve into soul beasts. That also means that there are possibly hundreds or thousands of Jade Phosphorous Flowers of the Nine Absolutes among the plants we saw. Let’s not discuss us, even a group of Titled Douluo would be in a hurry to get away from here. The ten-thousand year Jade Phosphorous Exotic Flowers channel something called the Jade Phosphorus Poison Cloud, and every plant releasing their poisonous clouds at the same time is a power that’s nearly invincible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao drew a cold breath as he heard Wang Qiu’er’s explanation. Huo Yuhao had always believed ever since he got that letter from Niu Tian that this task was accomplishable, since Niu Tian had given it to him. Even though it was possibly overwhelmingly challenging, he should at least have a chance of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after listening to Wang Qiu’er’s explanation of how frightening the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Nine Absolutes was, he understood that his chances were as slim as they could get. He would undoubtedly become fertilizer for the these flowers if he pushed forward forcibly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were countless plant-type soul beasts around this place... top-tier plant-type soul beasts! They could also work together, and they could launch an attack with a colossal area of effect, as if they were an army. They could be said to have no loopholes at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could he have even a sliver of chance under such circumstances? Huo Yuhao grew silent, and even his eyes began to dim and grow solemn. He could no longer see any hope at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s eyes flowed with struggle and conflict as she stared at Huo Yuhao’s dejected and defeated face, as if she were hesitant about something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh and said, “I will remember this place. Let’s retreat and rest up.” He had already used two Milk Bottles, and even though he still had several incendiary cannon shells, they would be completely useless against the Jade Phosphorous Poison Cloud, and fire even seemed to make these clouds stronger. If they pushed forward blindly, they would be simply sending themselves to certain death. He wasn’t afraid of death if he had to do so to save Dong’er, but he couldn’t just die for nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao grabbed Wang Qiu’er’s hand as he spoke, and turned around and flew away from the valley. He flew out of the area covered by the miasmic clouds before they descended back into the Setting Sun Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took the two empty Milk Bottles from Wang Qiu’er once they were on the ground, and then gradually infused soul power into each Milk Bottle while he silently contemplated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mental state wasn’t in the right condition at the moment, and there was no way he could make it better. He was faced with an impossible situation, and there was practically no way he could move forward. As intelligent as he was, Huo Yuhao began to feel as if he was at his wit’s end, and he had exhausted everything he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er just stood there as she watched his dark and gloomy expression. Her tensed brows began to smooth out as she heaved a faint sigh and said, “I don’t think I’m wrong to label the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes as rare and precious. Venomous flowers as powerful as this are extremely rare even deep within the Great Star Dou Forest, and there are hardly more than three that appear at the same time even if they do. They require too much from their surroundings, and that means it’s very difficult for them to evolve into soul beasts. So many Jade Phosphorous Flowers of the Seven Absolutes existing in this area only proves one thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked up at her and asked, “What does it prove?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er lowered her voice and said, “It proves that the valley behind them truly contains some exotic treasure, and I’m certain that, whatever it is, there’s a lot of it. Perhaps the valley has an environment that’s extremely beneficial for growth, and that has provided enough nutrients for these flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I observed carefully when you pulled me through the air before this. I realized that the Jade Phosphorous Flower of the Seven Absolutes dots the area surrounding the valley, but not a single one grows near the edge of the valley. That means there should be something inside the valley that’s countering them and holding them back, such that they don’t dare to spread inside the valley. The miasmic clouds that we faced before this probably come from these flowers – such an enormous volume of these flowers has led to the death of many soul beasts, while the vegetation all around has been corroded. The forest’s unique location and environment also means that it’s a lot easier for this miasma to form, and this accumulation over the years has resulted in the level of miasma that we see now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lowered his voice and said, “That also means that my judgment is correct. The herb that can save Dong’er must be located within that valley. However, we still have no way of crossing over to the other side. The Jade Phosphorus Flowers of the Seven Absolutes, and the Jade Phosphorus Flowers of the Nine Absolutes that they have evolved into, aren’t something we can fight against. The Jade Phosphorous Poison Cloud is probably so dense that the clouds will dispel my Class 6 soul protective barrier immediately once they touch it. If that happens, the two of us will melt into liquid in the blink of an eye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er frowned and said, “You don’t have to make it sound so disgusting. Haven’t you heard of the saying that everything in the world has a weakness? The flowers are strong, but there must be something in the world that can counter it. For example, such a thing exists in that valley. Furthermore, I also know one such weakness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was taken aback as he said urgently, “You… why haven’t you told me before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er said coldly, “You are the one who wants to save Wang Dong’er, not me. I would have told you if you hadn’t been so melancholic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned, and emotions undulated in his eyes for a moment. “Please tell me, Qiu’er. I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er interrupted him roughly and said, “Sure, I can tell you. But only if you kneel down and beg me to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned once more, and then he was instantly infuriated. “Are you crazy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er stared at him with an extremely noble and cold look. “I’m not crazy, you’re the one that’s crazy. So what if you can pierce through the Jade Phosphorus Poison Clouds? Can you predict the dangers that you will face afterwards? Since you’ve already decided to die, what use do you have for dignity? Kneel and beg me, and I will tell you. Otherwise, scram back to the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gradually calmed down, and he heaved a faint sigh. “Does this really have to happen, Qiu’er?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er grunted coldly, but said nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned around and gazed at the miasmic clouds in the distance. “I have already explained so much to you.
