 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dancing figure kept on drifting into his mind. Huo Yuhao had a dazed look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure’s long pinkish-blue hair was the same color as Wang Dong’s. He couldn’t help but recall the time when they unleashed the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer together. The fusion of their martial souls then projected his adult figure that unleashed an extremely powerful blow. Huo Yuhao still clearly recalled the strength of that blow. It was an amazing feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But why did the Raiment of Light turn into a ravishing beauty? Did the Radiant Butterfly Goddess descend? That didn’t seem too possible either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Dong was the one who controlled that martial fusion soul skill, Huo Yuhao’s impression of it wasn’t very deep. Wang Dong had even lost consciousness after the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right, how was Wang Dong now? Both of them had over-drafted their powers, and Huo Yuhao immediately thought of Wang Dong as he recalled everything that had happened before. He suddenly became anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his body was depleted, he was only fatigued. With the Life Gold nourishing him and his own extraordinary life power, his body recovered quickly after he rested for a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Huo Yuhao still found it difficult to move. He couldn’t go and find Wang Dong even if he wanted to. He could only calm himself down and use the Mysterious Heaven Technique to restore his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Heaven Technique was very effective in healing and recovery. When it was initially activated, Huo Yuhao could only sense according to how he cultivated normally because he had no excess soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a tinge of soul power seemed to be squeezed out from his limbs after three days. They started to be activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything was different when he had soul power. Huo Yuhao sat up, albeit with difficulty. He focused his mind and attention on activating his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Mysterious Heaven Technique didn’t just restore his power. It also nourished his body. The sore feeling he felt was also alleviated as his soul power was activated. But Huo Yuhao didn’t see the Eye of Life opening on his forehead. The dim green that contained a life aura nourished his entire body quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he awoke from his cultivation, it was already dark outside. It was already evening.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he stretched, Huo Yuhao made a surprising discovery. His soul power had increased once again and was now quite close to Rank 29. This had something to do with his effort in cultivation, but more importantly, his potential was stimulated by that life and death situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he couldn’t be bothered about his delight now. There were too many things on his mind. He jumped out of bed and changed his clothes. He didn’t even wash up before he rushed out of his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao subconsciously wanted to go to Wang Dong’s room. But he soon realized that there were more important things. That’s why he went to knock on Wang Yan’s door directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao realized that Teacher Wang had black circles all over his eyes when the door opened. He looked very lethargic, as if he had yet to wake up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher Wang, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao? You’re fine already? How’s your body?” Wang Yan was jolted awake seeing that it was him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hurriedly asked, “Teacher Wang, how’s my elder sister? The black flames…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan creased his brows and said in a deep voice, “Troublesome. We became the eventual champions after the tournament ended yesterday. After we returned, Elder Xuan started to help Xiaotao suppress the black flames. Although the overall strength of the black flames can’t compare to Elder Xuan, they’re very resilient. They managed to free themselves even though Elder Xuan suppressed them a few times. Xiaotao’s awareness still remains unclear. The trouble is indeed quite great now! We must return to the academy once we collect our prize. We need to treat her using the academy’s resources. Come in first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Wang Yan allowed Huo Yuhao into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan’s room was a little messy. The curtains were still drawn, and it was obvious that he had been resting before Huo Yuhao came. He was too exhausted. As the teacher in charge of this tournament, he was under greater pressure than anyone else. He felt as if his body was going to collapse after he became more relaxed following the excitement of being crowned champions. After settling a few matters when he returned, he collapsed onto his bed. He tried to crawl out of bed a few times, as he was worried about his students’ condition. That was why he looked so exhausted now. Without some adjustment, he wouldn’t be able to restore himself to his peak state. But this experience was still very precious to Wang Yan. He became a much more outstanding teacher in terms of experience, mentality and some other subtle aspects.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan allowed Huo Yuhao to take a seat and poured a glass of water for him. “Your body is already fine?” he asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t stand on ceremony, and downed the glass of water. He replied, “I’m already fine. I was just exhausted. Teacher Wang, will elder sister’s martial soul turn into an evil martial soul?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the most familiar with Ma Xiaotao’s Evil Phoenix among everyone. While the evil aura of the original phoenix flames was very obvious, it was suppressed by the phoenix flames. But Huo Yuhao could no longer feel the nobility of the phoenix flames when Ma Xiaotao’s martial soul transformed. It was only left with desperation and violence. This shouldn’t resemble a normal soul master’s martial soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan wore a bitter look. “If the black flames can’t be completely suppressed, she may become an evil soul master. She’ll even become an extremely powerful one. Elder Xuan mentioned that Xiaotao’s soul power reached Rank 70 after the phoenix flames turned black. After she obtains seven rings, there’s likely to be another increase. Elder Xuan is also unclear about how much it can potentially increase. But we’ll definitely hope that Xiaotao won’t become an evil soul master. Her awareness will be consumed by the evil darkness. When that happens, she won’t be the original Ma Xiaotao anymore. She’ll be an evil Dark Phoenix.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was shocked as he said, “What should we do then? Elder sister…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan sighed and shook his head. He replied, “At least, we have no solution now. We can only see after we return to the academy. Elder Xuan has already brought Xiaotao back to the academy. He will come back to fetch us after that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief after he heard that Ma Xiaotao had returned to the academy. He had great belief in the academy. He only asked out of curiosity, “Teacher Wang, why do we need Elder Xuan to fetch us? Can’t we go back ourselves? Our injuries aren’t too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan looked at him with a deep gaze and said, “Yuhao, you can’t leave the academy for some time after we return this time. You can’t even leave during the holidays. After becoming champions of this tournament, all of you have gone into the spotlight and have become others’ targets. What if someone wants to harm all of you? The academy is only being cautious. Did you forget the Body Sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao opened his eyes wide. “Are you saying that someone will…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan nodded and replied, “We can’t exclude that possibility. Those fellows won’t act recklessly with Elder Xuan around. Don’t ever underestimate the evilness of this world. All of you are already so outstanding at such a young age. What about 10, 20 years later? Our rivals won’t want to see all of you reach the stage where you become threats to them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brows. Although he wasn’t old, he was much more mature than others of the same age. He understood Wang Yan immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher Wang, how’s Wang Dong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan said, “His condition is quite stable. Like you, his body was over-drafted. Both of you gave your all in the final. Honestly, your martial soul fusion skills shocked everyone. This is the first time in the continent’s history where 2 twin martial souls managed to unleash 4 martial soul fusion skills. You must both be more aware of your safety precisely because of this. Alright, go take a look at him. Just get whatever you want to eat from the hotel. You’re a star now.” A comforted smile appeared on his face after he finished speaking. The way he looked at Huo Yuhao was like how he was looking at his own kid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao always had Wang Dong’s room key, just like how Wang Dong would walk in and out of his room freely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao walked into the room after opening the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was still asleep. His entire body was covered by a warm blanket, and only his pale face was revealed.</span></p>
