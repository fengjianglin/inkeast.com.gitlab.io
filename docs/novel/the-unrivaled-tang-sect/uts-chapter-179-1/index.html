 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the start, Huo Yuhao could still accurately judge and adapt using his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track. But Na Na was getting faster and faster. The wind blades unleashed from her Swift Blade were also increasing. A new batch of wind blades would appear before he had a chance to dispel the previous batch. The entire place was filled with green lights, and Huo Yuhao had disappeared within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had no choice but to unleash his Ice Empress’ Armor, as he was under immense pressure. The diamond ice crystals resisted the wind blades, piercingly sharp noises were released when both powers clashed. Huo Yuhao seemed to be at more and more at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Na Na was also a little anxious. Huo Yuhao’s defensive soul skills were very strong, and her wind blades had a negligible effect on him. The Swift Blade was much inferior to the Scarletflame Blade in terms of offensive strength, and could be blocked by Huo Yuhao using just his hands. They were stuck in a stalemate. Na Na didn’t really have much of an advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If this is all you’re capable of, you’re going to lose,” Huo Yuhao’s voice sounded in her ears. Following that, Huo Yuhao’s footsteps became a little messy, and his speed increased slightly. His Darkgolden Terrorclaws appeared again. However, he wasn’t just resisting the Swift Blade this time. Rather, he was also attacking Na Na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na’s momentum was such that she couldn’t dodge when Huo Yuhao positioned his terrorclaws right at a specific position that she had to cross. She clashed with them heavily, using her blade to block their attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it wasn’t just a simple meeting of blades this time. Huo Yuhao’s terrorclaws closed up, and his body was about to ram into Na Na. The two of them were approaching each other rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oh no!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Na Na’s third soul ring lit up as she reacted, and her body turned illusory. Huo Yuhao brushed past her, and there was no impact between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Na Na’s third soul skill, Spectre Possession. She could turn her body into a spectre, and not be struck by anything physical, but only for a second. It was a life-saving technique. She couldn’t attack as this soul skill was unleashed, which was why Na Na hadn’t used it before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But she couldn’t hold back this skill any longer. When their paths crossed, her fourth soul ring also lit up. Her shadow detached from her body as she paled,and it suddenly landed on Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was engulfed by a layer of black gas. He couldn’t move even though he struggled mightily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na suddenly turned back and burst towards him with the Swift Blade. She slashed the blade towards his neck. This was the effect of her fourth soul skill, Avenging Spirit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her soul skill had a powerful restraining effect, but it had a lot of restrictions. It was operated using her spiritual power. But if the opponent couldn’t be restricted, she would suffer from the backlash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ve won!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na said to herself in her heart. However, she abruptly realized that something was amiss when she saw the look in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. He was too calm. He didn’t seem to be restrained...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little amused at this point. In his mind, Elder Yi remarked, “She must be tired of living, using an Avenging Spirit in front of a necromancer!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Na Na realized something was wrong, Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned grey, and an indescribable fear instantly engulfed Na Na. Following this, Huo Yuhao seemed to mutter something. The Avenging Spirit surrounding Huo Yuhao’s body instantly disappeared, seeming to fuse into Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No backlash occurred. Na Na only felt a sense of emptiness, and staggered a little, but she still managed to react. Her fifth soul ring lit up, and she reached out with her left hand. A small and short white dagger that was only five inches long was flung towards Huo Yuhao at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Na Na’s trump card. She finally used it as she was in deep peril. It was a Class 6 close-combat soul tool, the Blinkknife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The throwing knife didn’t make a sound, but it instantly reached Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had been too careless. When he used Elder Yi’s necromancy to deal with the Avenging Spirit, he had the ability to restrain Na Na’s martial soul through their soul connection, and had done so. That’s why Na Na’s fifth soul skill wasn’t really unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Blinkknife still reached him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The knife was hidden in a storage ring on Na Na’s left hand. It possessed a tremendous destructive strength. In this critical situation, Huo Yuhao had no choice but to lift his hand to block the knife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress’ Pincer didn’t completely resist the Blinkknife. His palm was instantly pierced. However, the Ice Empress’ Pincer and Mysterious Jade Hands’ defensive strength managed to buy Huo Yuhao some time. He lifted his hand as he looked backward. The Blinkknife almost kissed Huo Yuhao’s face as it flew past him. It turned into a streak of white light as it went on by, and only stopped when it hit the defensive barrier around the arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao broke out in a cold sweat, even though it was a sudden change. He was too careless, and had almost been killed by the Blinkknife!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fresh blood flowed from his left hand. His expression also turned colder. He shrugged his left hand and sealed the blood on it, then continued to attack Na Na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na was indeed resilient. She couldn’t get closer to control the Blinkknife without the help of her martial soul. Otherwise, she believed that she would’ve won. Even so, she continued to wield the Swift Blade and slashed at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Huo Yuhao’s gaze was extremely cold now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom…!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;A series of booms rang out in front of Na Na. Huo Yuhao’s blood also contained soul power! He used his own blood to unleash the Ice Explosion Technique, and forced Na Na back with a series of explosions, and the Swift Blade was also torn from her hand. She couldn’t resist the explosions in such a condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t chase after her. He only shouted, “Don’t move!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na’s body suddenly jerked, and she was actually frozen in place. She was horrified. She couldn’t understand why her body didn’t listen to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re so intent on killing me? We’re only sparring,” Huo Yuhao said coldly. He slowly placed the Darkgolden Terrorclaws in front of Na Na. The wound on his left hand had already been sealed by ice, and stopped bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na couldn’t calm down at this point. This situation that she couldn’t comprehend left her extremely afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve won.” Huo Yuhao wasn’t above hitting a woman, but the killing spirit that he restrained wouldn’t be unleashed at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux taught him that there were different regions in a person’s spirit, even though it was a complete entity. He had also taught Huo Yuhao the different capabilities of a human’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na’s Avenging Spirit aimed to restrain a person’s movements, which was why it now controlled Na Na’s own movements. After her Avenging Spirit was snatched using necromancy, Huo Yuhao easily found the characteristic of her spirit, which was why he could restrain her now. If Huo Yuhao destroyed this part of her spirit, she might be paralyzed. Without her spirit, she would be unable to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He relaxed his will and released his control on Na Na before turning around. He walked back towards the waiting area. His energy had been greatly depleted in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na chased after him and shouted, “What did you do to me?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were somewhere else, others might misunderstand her words. But no one could sense the fear in Na Na’s heart at this moment. When Huo Yuhao had controlled her body, she felt as if she lost something important.</span></p>

She couldn’t sense Huo Yuhao unleashing any undulations of soul power. The force that was restraining her seemed to come from inside her. This also meant that she wasn’t being restrained by one of his soul skills. After she thought of how her Avenging Spirit had disappeared earlier, she roughly guessed that it was a side effect that was more scary than a direct backlash.</span></p>

At this point, she didn’t dare pester him anymore. As she thought of how completely helpless she was in front of him, that she could only let him do what he wanted, she wanted to kill him!</span></p>

He was furious, as Na Na had almost killed him. He decided to punish her since she hadn’t treated this as a sparring match. He was going to keep this spirit with him, and he would only return it to her after some time.</span></p>

They had clashed at such close range that even the Hallmaster of Illustrious Virtue Hall wouldn’t have been able to separate the two of them if he was the referee.</span></p>
