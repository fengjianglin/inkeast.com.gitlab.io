At least, it was a start to understanding this place better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took another step and finally entered that barren patch of land. Huo Yuhao immediately felt a wave of intense and scorching heat hit him in the face, and even his clothes began to smell burnt. The air around him was rippling from the heat!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s so hot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao almost instinctively unleashed his Ice Empress’ Armor, which covered his entire body. Ultimate Ice was Ultimate Ice after all, and even though Huo Yuhao was still a world away from the Blazing Delicate Apricot’s cultivation and close to the Blazing Sunspring, he still had enough strength to protect himself in such an environment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot quivered faintly as she said, “Eh? Ultimate Ice. It’s no wonder You You wants me to do it. Little guy, let me see if your Ultimate Ice is stronger, or if my Ultimate Fire is stronger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao forced a laugh and replied, “That doesn’t seem very fair senior, as our cultivations are not equal in the first place. Furthermore, you have the Blazing Sunspring behind you that You You speaks of, so my abilities will be greatly reduced. How could I be a match for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot grunted and said, “Weren’t you extremely courageous when you ingested the Fullmoon Piercing Autumn Dew? Why are you cowering away now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered seriously, “I’m not cowering away. The only thing is that book is extremely important to me, and I absolutely have to pass your test. Therefore, all I’m hoping for is that the test will be more just and fair. I also believe that you’re not the kind to bully weaker individuals.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot said plainly, “Saying all that is useless. My test has been predetermined, and what you shall face is an opponent that is equal to your abilities – Ultimate Fire. However, your opponent will be supported by the Blazing Sunspring, and you will pass if you defeat your opponent. Otherwise, you can leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot leaned backwards vigorously as she spoke, and a peculiar fiery-red whirlpool suddenly appeared in front of the flower. The whirlpool resembled a colossal whale sucking in water as it drew in a large pool of fiery-red spring water from the Blazing Sunspring before firing the water into the air in a violent pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fiery-red pillar of water condensed and didn’t fall apart. The air around it began to twist energetically and contort wherever this pillar passed, and the temperature within the valley skyrocketed once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The test has begun!” the Blazing Delicate Apricot’s emotionless voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purplish-golden light in Huo Yuhao’s eyes became more intense as he half-crouched, and he made a pose as if he were about to erupt at any moment. His right hand’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw lashed out, and a bluish-green light shone like a wave from his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fiery-red pillar descended from the sky and came directly for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot’s voice could be heard once more. “Oh, yes. You’re not allowed to step out of this barren area to avoid damaging the plants around you. You will lose if you step out of this area.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao would have cursed at the top of his voice if he could, or if he had the time to curse. He couldn’t step out of this area, and that meant he would have to battle in the second hottest place within this valley. His Ultimate Ice would be greatly weakened in the process, while the Blazing Delicate Apricot’s intense heat would be greatly amplified. How could he win this fight, even if they had the same cultivation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that he had no time or space to curse. The searing pillar of water bore down on him as his Spirit Eyes stared ahead, and he could clearly feel how frightening this attack was. The Blazing Sunspring was so hot that even Ma Xiaotao’s transformation into the Darkness Phoenix couldn’t compare to it, This was true Ultimate Fire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red pillar of water covered an enormous area, but Huo Yuhao didn’t intend to meet force with force. He tapped on the ground with his foot, and his entire body sprang into the air like a lightning bolt. He twisted and somersaulted in the sky as he nimbly dodged the pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of the blazing spring water smeared across his Ice Empress’ Armor, and some of the diamond crystals formed by the armor melted as a result. However, he managed to jump through an opening, and his left hand supported him on the ground as his body turned once more in midair. He tapped on the ground with his foot and changed directions as he leapt through yet another crack in the pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Spiritual Detection had evolved, and this gave him even greater ability to grasp opportunities. He narrowly but impeccably evaded the Blazing Sunspring’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the scorching spring water didn’t disappear when it landed on the ground. Instead, it congregated together strangely and instantly transformed into a humanoid figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had initially believed that he would be facing the Blazing Delicate Apricot. This was the reason why he was still on guard against her when he leapt through the air. Only now did he realize that his opponent was that fiery-red spring water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spring water congregated into a female human figure, Her features were faint and subtle, while there seemed to be a long red ponytail that draped all the way to her feet. Her figure was stunning, but it was a pity that the temperature emanating from her body was simply too frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot released another red beam that landed on the body the water had formed, and this fiery girl immediately became golden-red. Her hands were lowered to her sides, and she now had a long flaming blade in each hand. She tapped her foot on the ground and pounced towards Huo Yuhao, raising the two blades high above her head and slashing out violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection allowed him to detect even the smallest details and elemental differences after his Purple Demon Eyes ascended into the Mustard Domain. He looked on speechlessly as countless red specks of elemental fire swiftly congregated toward the fire lady’s twin blades as she raised her blades in the air. The fiery radiance at the tips of her blades reached up more than ten feet when she finally slashed down... and all of that was the unbelievably searing Ultimate Fire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was at a great disadvantage because he was forced to fight this fire lady within the area designated by the Blazing Delicate Apricot. The temperature in this place wasn’t even, and the closer it was to the Blazing Sunspring, the higher it became… and the closer he was to the Blazing Delicate Apricot, the hotter it became! Huo Yuhao felt as if the Ultimate Ice within his body was being greatly suppressed and stifled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m dodging this!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao’s body flickered as he used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, and he once again relied on the might of his Spiritual Detection to leap through an opening within the pattern of the flaming knives. But this time, he retaliated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bluish-green light converged in front of his chest, and an extremely chilly bluish-green pillar of light burst out from his chest. Ice Empress’ Wrath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes grew slack immediately after he unleashed this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Sunspring seemed like it had a life of its own, as if it could feel Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. The fiery-red spring water surged into the air, as if something had induced a tidal wave, and an intense heat wave rushed toward him in the next moment. Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress’ Wrath hadn’t even reached the fire lady yet, but most of its strength had been dispelled by the scorching heat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fire lady seemed like she had just taken steroids, and her frame exploded in size. Her former scarlet-gold color was now almost entirely gold. Her now-golden flaming knives crossed, and Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress’ Wrath was cut into a million pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How do I fight this? The Blazing Sunspring can also help it fight?! This… isn’t this cheating?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was truly exasperated. However, he was the passive one in this test, and he was in no position to determine the test’s criteria.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fire lady pounced toward him once more in a flash. This time, she wasn’t in a hurry to slash down with her flaming knives, and her movements changed right when Huo Yuhao attempted to dodge her using Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fire lady’s body also became a little illusory. Huo Yuhao wanted to dodge to one side, but she followed his footsteps to the same side before she laid her flaming knives in front of him. It felt as if Huo Yuhao was about to slam himself into those flaming knives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I…” Huo Yuhao finally started to curse. No matter how powerful his Spiritual Detection was, there was no way that the fire lady could make the same steps as he did, the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track’s steps…?!?</span></p>

This was the Instant Teleportation that the wolf-ape’s left leg bone had given him.</span></p>

Fine, then I won’t use Ultimate Ice.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao slashed out with his right hand after he used Instant Teleportation, and his Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s sharp edges reached out over seven meters. The frightening blade seemed to howl as it flickered once when it slashed through the air, as if it were about to sever the world itself in two.</span></p>

It was hard to avoid this attack even if his opponent could predict it. In the end, Instant Teleportation was just too quick, while the Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s area of effect was too vast at the same time.</span></p>

He had always been absolutely confident of his Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s offensive ability, and even powerful eight-ringed Soul Sages would probably be injured if they took a direct hit from this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, something else happened that made his eyes droop and his mouth go slack.</span></p>

However, these pieces reverted into spring water once they dropped to the ground, and the liquid swiftly congregated once more. The fire lady reappeared in the time that Huo Yuhao spent in a daze, and she resumed slashing at him with her long flaming knives once more. This time, she pounced toward Huo Yuhao as if she loomed over the entire world, and it felt as if the fire lady had a life of her own...and she was angry…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Physical attacks are useless? Can they stop cheating like that?</span></p>

He retreated at breakneck speed as he raised his left hand, and a golden light screen immediately transformed into a ripple as he placed it before him.</span></p>
