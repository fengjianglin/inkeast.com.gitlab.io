 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao experienced an inexplicably blissful feeling when he was sliding down from the wall again. Ultimately, his Yin Yang Complement soul cores were still very useful. The pain he felt from being thrown by the seal disappeared much faster than before. The pain was nothing if he could be kissed like this all the time. No matter how strong the seal was, he did not have to fear it, especially when his skin was now unbelievably thick after absorbing the Dragon Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hehehe! My future father-in-law, let’s see how much longer your seal can hold me back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao regained his balance and stood up as he flashed a cheeky smile at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you trying to do?” Tang Wutong could sense that Huo Yuhao had some naughty ideas in his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao giggled and said, “Nothing much. I was just thinking that I deserved to be punished a few more times, since you wanted to punish me earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Tang Wutong could react, Huo Yuhao pounced in her direction. Tang Wutong tried to evade, but Huo Yuhao was able to accurately determine the direction she was heading with his Spiritual Detection. Before she could flee, he had already hugged her and planted his lips on hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mhhmm…” Tang Wutong was trying to break away from his clutches. However, Huo Yuhao was once again tossed away by the seal in the very next instant. The powerful seal had once again “punished” him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time round, Huo Yuhao leaped up before he had even reached the floor, and pounced towards Tang Wutong again. “Let’s try again! I need a tougher punishment!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Tang Wutong had learned her lesson, as she immediately activated her Instant Teleportation Left Leg Bone and flickered away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just when she was about to reappear at another corner of the room, she saw a person with a sly smile before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them shared the same soul skill, and had formerly fused their martial souls. After acquiring his second soul core, Huo Yuhao had a much deeper mastery of spatial power. Hence, he was able to use his Spiritual Detection and sensitivity towards the spatial power around him to accurately determine where Tang Wutong would reappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Tang Wutong thought she was about to be forcefully kissed by Huo Yuhao again, Huo Yuhao suddenly stopped in front of her and grabbed her shoulders. He said, “Wutong, let’s stop the punishment here. I have received news from Ju Zi that they’re planning to attack the Dou Ling Empire. However, as of now, we are unable to convince the Elders in the Academy about her plan. I think we have no choice but to make a trip ourselves. Is eldest senior brother back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “He is back. I heard that the Star Luo Empire was a lot more receptive. They left some of their elite troops in their land even though they’re still sending some of their people over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “We can’t care about what they plan to do anymore. I will head over and send my regards to eldest senior brother before we leave. We need to head over to the Dou Ling Empire and see if we can stop the Sun Moon Empire from attacking them. Ju Zi will not be able to bring too many of her troops, because she has to keep some of them here to preserve their fighting power on the main battlefield, and to continue deceiving us. She’ll most likely send her soul engineer legions to attack the weakest point in the Dou Ling Empire’s lines.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong answered, “Alright. You can go ahead and look for eldest senior brother. I’ll pack my stuff, and we’ll leave right afterward.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Huo Yuhao replied as he turned around and stepped out of the room. However, he suddenly stopped moving as he turned around and looked at Tang Wutong. He asked gently, “Are you tired?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head gently and replied, “Nope. As long as I’m with you, it’s okay to be a little more tired than usual. However, just promise me that you won’t risk your life when I’m not around. Do you know how scared I was when I wasn’t with you during that period of time? I was so afraid that I would lose you when I came back only to find out that you weren’t here. I heard that even Di Tian came after you while I was away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao brushed his hand through Tang Wutong’s long violet hair and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll never risk my life like this again. I only did this because I was confident that I could pull it off. Right now, Di Tian is entangled in his own affairs, and will not be looking for me in the near future. However, I must share a piece of good news with you. I have managed to remove the reverse scale that Di Tian planted on me during my breakthrough. Alright, I’ll take my leave. You can pack your stuff in the meantime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Tang Wutong answered as Huo Yuhao left the room and went to look for Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was looking for Bei Bei not only for updates on the Star Luo Empire, but also because of Tang Ya. Now that Tang Ya was beginning her recovery process, her own Bluesilver Grass martial soul was naturally reawakened. However, she had not been able to completely fuse with the Bluesilver Emperor. After all, she had not yet reached a bottleneck in her cultivation, and could only allow the Bluesilver Emperor to become her Spirit when she finally reached Rank 90. Huo Yuhao was going to check on her current situation. This was especially important since he had taken the Life Guardian Sword away from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eldest senior brother.” Huo Yuhao did not use his Spiritual Detection to check on the situation in Bei Bei’s room. After all, this would infringe on Bei Bei and Tang Ya’s privacy. His voice was not particularly loud, but it was still able to penetrate through the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? Little junior brother.” After hearing Huo Yuhao’s voice, Huo Yuhao was able to hear someone putting on their clothes in the room. Following which, he heard a dissatisfied female grunt. It was obvious that someone in the room was displeased with being interrupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It did not take too long before Bei Bei stepped out of the room. He did not seem to be tired at all. In fact, he seemed to have a radiant glow around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked awkwardly, “Eldest senior brother, how is Teacher Xiao Ya doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, erm, she’s doing very well.” Bei Bei replied in an equally awkward fashion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was definitely able to tell what they were doing. He suddenly felt that the predicament he shared with Tang Wutong was very tragic.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My dear future father-in-law, when will you appear before us?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I paid a visit to the Star Luo Empire, and the White Tiger Duke seemed to share the same sentiments as us after hearing your analysis. However, he believes that Shrek City is equally important. Hence, he still decided to send a part of his elite troops over while maintaining a tight defense at the Star Luo Empire. To be honest, the Star Luo Empire is collectively quite powerful. The Sun Moon Empire might not be able to take them down if they don’t mobilize their full power. He also asked me to send you his regards. I also shared with him how we managed to attack the Sun Moon Empire from its within. The White Tiger Duke said he also wanted to see if there’s any way he can deal more blows to them. He believes that we can’t wait passively like this any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, eldest senior brother. Now I am clear about the current situation. The Sun Moon Empire plans to attack the Dou Ling Empire. Hence, I am going to pay a visit to the Dou Ling Empire with Wutong. If we happen to bump into any of the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions along the way, we will definitely crush them. I have brought all three soul engineer legions back into Shrek City. I will need your help to arrange them for the city’s defense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei looked at Huo Yuhao and asked, “Little junior brother, I heard that you have become a Titled Douluo?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “I was very lucky to have made my breakthrough. Eldest senior brother, you can rest assured that as long as Wutong and I are together, we will be able to retreat safely even if we can’t take down our enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded and replied, “I have never found the need to be worried about the two of you. I will handle matters in the Academy. However, you might be a little vulnerable if it’s just the two of you. Should I get Sanshi and the rest to follow you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought for a while before replying, “The Academy should be pretty safe for now. In that case, I’ll probably get them to join us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you going to set off now?” Bei Bei asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. “Time waits for no man. I believe the Sun Moon Empire’s troops must have already set off. The earlier we leave, the likelier it is for us to stop them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood Ju Zi too well. Even though she might have revealed her target to him, she had probably executed her plan already. It was likely that the Sun Moon Empire had made their move, and were entering from another side the moment the Dou Ling Empire’s elite troops left. Because the border between the Heavenly Soul Empire and Dou Ling Empire was very long, it would be difficult for the Dou Ling Empire to defend against such an incursion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei asked, “Who do you plan to bring along with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third senior brother, fourth senior sister, Brother Ji, Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu,” Huo Yuhao replied decisively, “if we bring too many people, we’ll lose the element of surprise. I think just a few of us should suffice. I will leave second eldest brother to assist Teacher Xuan with soul tools. Since he’s not going, fifth senior sister should also stay behind. It wouldn’t be nice to separate them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. Let’s follow your plan then. Let’s go and get them to get ready.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, most soul masters spent a large part of their nights meditating. Hence, there was no such thing as disturbing their sleep. Huo Yuhao was able to get all of them ready within fifteen minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After getting Tang Wutong to join the rest of them, Huo Yuhao opened the spectral gate instead of getting everyone to fly and leave. He brought everyone into the spectral demiplane so that they could continue cultivating in the campsite within the demiplane while he flew alone. This would allow him to move faster than if everyone were to fly with him. At the same time, the others could continue to rest in the spectral demiplane and keep themselves in their best possible form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao bade goodbye to Bei Bei, but did not inform the Academy of the details of his trip. Once again, he leapt up into the sky and flew in the direction of the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he ascended into the sky, Huo Yuhao closed his eyes and released his spiritual power into his surroundings. He was relying entirely on his Spiritual Detection to sense the world around him. Flying was no longer an activity which consumed his energy. In fact, he could even rest and cultivate while he was flying.</span></p>
