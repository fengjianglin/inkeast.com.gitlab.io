 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...After leaving Radiant City, we took a short rest to reorganize ourselves. Because we didn’t hear about the news, we returned. Just now, we caught wind of news about how the Heavenly Soul Empire…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded. “I see. The Sun Moon Empire would never have changed their battle plans if all of you were to only attack those normal cities. But you exceeded everyone’s expectations by successfully attacking Radiant City. After that, the Sun Moon Empire had no choice but to view all of you with great importance. It also seems like your team left some tracks behind which allowed them to trace you. Hence, they are demanding us to turn you over to them within ten days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought for a while before saying, “Elder Xuan, I don’t think it’s that simple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm?” Elder Xuan seemed to be curious about what Huo Yuhao was hinting at. “Tell me what you think about this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I don’t think it’s very likely for the Sun Moon Empire to pass orders to the front line to demand that the academy turn me in. After all, they would probably think I’m still in the Sun Moon Empire. Also, it would be impossible for the Academy to contact me in ten days. Furthermore, they should know that it would be futile to ask the Academy to turn me in!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan said, “Could they be using this as an excuse to attack the Academy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, Huo Yuhao shook his head. “I don’t think so. The time they are giving us is way too long. Ten days is considered very long for a battle that uses soul tools. If they are willing to give us ten days to turn me in, it doesn’t look like they intend to attack us directly. Of course, there’s still a possibility that they’re just trying to numb us before launching an attack. But from the looks of things, I think that’s quite unlikely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is that?” Princess Wei Na asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “The current Commander of the Sun Moon Empire’s Three Armies is the War God Empress. I actually know her personally from back when I was in the Sun Moon Empire for the exchange program. She was my senior sister back then, as we learned and studied under a common teacher. Hence, we have a pretty decent relationship.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he talked about his relationship with Ju Zi, Tang Wutong pinched his thigh under the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao did not show any expression of pain on his face as he continued, “This senior sister of mine was not particularly gifted in building soul tools or cultivating. However, she possessed immense gifts when it came to military affairs. Previously, she was the one who came up with the entire plan to feint an attack on the Ming Dou Mountain Range before striking the Heavenly Soul Empire. After penetrating the borders of the Heavenly Soul Empire, she returned to the Sun Moon Empire to give birth to their Prince. During that time, the Sun Moon Empire’s army was particularly quiet due to her absence. However, she has now returned. She is very clever with her tactics, and does not indulge in any meaningless battles. If she knew it was impossible for the Academy to turn me in, there must be some deeper reason why she planted her troops around Shrek City. In my opinion, it isn’t likely that they would attack the Academy directly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dean Yan said, “But we cannot eliminate this possibility. Otherwise, if they were to launch an all-out attack on us, the blood and sweat which has been invested in the Academy for the past ten thousand years would be destroyed in an instant. We cannot afford to let that happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and nodded. “This is exactly why Ju Zi is so smart. She understands how we have no choice but to rescue Shrek City and the Academy, and hence employed this method to control us. In fact, at this very instant, both Star Luo Empire and Dou Ling Empire would love to see the Sun Moon Empire do this to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is that?” Tang Wutong could not help but ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao explained, “It’s very simple. If the Sun Moon Empire were to attack us, how can Shrek Academy not defend itself? This would make us and our location an important pivot in the war. The only way for us to stand a chance would be to gather all the troops from the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires. And since both empires are fairly close to us, they can definitely send their troops over in ten days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his explanation, a heavy silence fell upon the room. They were all beginning to sense the true intentions behind her moves. This was an elaborate yet overt scheme designed by Ju Zi. By threatening the enemy, the enemy’s allies would have to rescue them. This would create a tactical space for Ju Zi’s troops to attack or retreat. No one would know what she had in mind for her next move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Ju Zi were to attack, Shrek Academy would definitely not be able to fend them off by themselves. Hence, they had to call for external reinforcement. Shrek Academy was simply unable to afford any losses!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what if the Sun Moon Empire chose to hold their horses and wait it out when the reinforcements finally arrived? Or what if they chose to take other actions instead? How should the academy react?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the entire Sea God’s Pavilion was quiet. Everyone seemed to be very frustrated and depressed by their current circumstances. The Sun Moon Empire had only moved their troops forward by fifty kilometers and fired some fireworks. But this was enough to cause a headache for Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Elder Xuan, who was usually extremely calm and composed, started to frown. It was apparent that he was becoming very worried about the circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er said, “Elder Xuan, is it possible for us to get help from the Great Star Dou Forest? After all, we have been sharing a pleasant cooperative relationship with them all this while. The Spirit Pagoda is also based in our city. If we can get them to help, it would be a lot easier to stop the Sun Moon Empire from attacking us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan shook his head and said, “I know the Beast God the best. It’s impossible to ask him to help us. In fact, he can’t wait for us humans to kill one another and weaken the human race’s power. This would grant soul beasts a greater amount of living space. After all, this battle is mainly taking place between soul masters and soul engineers, who both need soul rings. It would be a blessing for every soul beast if more soul masters were to die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qian Duoduo said, “Then what if we were to attack instead? After receiving our signal for help, the Star Luo Empire and Dou Ling Empire would definitely send their troops over as fast as possible. Under these circumstances, do you think we would stand a chance if we were to fight them head-on with our full power? At the very least, we can stop them from doing other things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “It will be very difficult for us to fight them head-on. They would only have to convert their soul tool deployment areas into forts to protect themselves from our attacks. Even if we were eventually able to penetrate their defenses, it would be at great cost. The chances of us doing that are just too slim. Our only advantage is that we have a greater number of individuals who are highly skilled in combat. However, our collective strength is a long way from theirs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er frowned and said, “Then what should we do? We can’t defend, right? It will be hard to defend against them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong suddenly spoke. “I think the best thing for us to do now is wait. We should not ask for help from the Dou Ling and Star Luo Empires. This will allow them to focus on defending their own borders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what she said, Huo Yuhao immediately looked at her. This was exactly what he had wanted to suggest. However, he was a little hesitant about voicing this controversial opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh? Why is that so?” Elder Xuan was surprised by Tang Wutong’s suggestion. The other Elders did not seem to be very receptive to it either. They did not seem to be very impressed by what she had said. Tang Wutong’s suggestion was a quick recipe for the fall of Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong looked at Huo Yuhao before letting out a cold grunt. “There are some words which might be hard for you to say. Since that’s the case, I will help you say them. I suggested this because the chances that Ju Zi will attack Shrek City are impossibly slim. As long as we allow Huo Yuhao to meet her and convince her that he is truly in the city, she would never order her army to attack Shrek City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was still confused by her words. “How is that possible? Unless she is scared of Yuhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pouted before complaining, “She’s not afraid of him. In fact, she likes him a lot. I believe she will never harm Yuhao. Hence, as long as she knows he is in the city, it is unlikely that she will order her troops to attack it. In my opinion, I believe that her demand for us to turn Huo Yuhao over is but a smokescreen she has created.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” The Elders were very surprised by her words.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The War God Empress of the Sun Moon Empire actually likes Huo Yuhao?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an unbelievable piece of news!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao blushed after hearing what Tang Wutong said. Tang Wutong also realized that her emotions were not very appropriate as she turned around before sticking out her tongue at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song, who had been keeping quiet all this while, suddenly interjected. “That would be too childish of her. This war is supposed to be part of the Sun Moon Empire’s plan to conquer the entire continent. It concerns the lives of millions. I don't think the War God Empress would allow her emotions to affect her decisions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Elder Song’s words, the other Elders could not help but nod. Tang Wutong’s opinion seemed to be borne out of her jealousy. It was still hard for them to believe that the Commander of the Sun Moon Empire’s Three Armies would allow her decisions to be contingent on her feelings for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no longer appropriate for Huo Yuhao to add any comments to the conversation. Actually, his thoughts were similar to Tang Wutong’s. When he saw the fireworks earlier, he had already guessed that it was a smokescreen set up by Ju Zi. However, she probably hadn’t expected him to return to the Academy so quickly to see the fireworks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a brilliant smokescreen. With over six hundred thousand troops pressuring and threatening Shrek City, the Academy would be forced to make a move. And in moments like this, if he were to make the same suggestion as Tang Wutong, he would only receive the same denigration and disapproval from the Elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan lamented, “This situation is extremely complex, and we must defend against it at all costs. Shrek City currently has over a hundred thousand troops. Now that the few of you have returned, we are in much better shape. We need to get the three soul engineer legions ready for battle as soon as possible. In addition, we need to start preparing our own soul tool deployment areas. Lexuan, can you inform the Star Luo Empire and Dou Ling Empire to step up their defenses, but prepare to assist us when necessary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roger.” Zhang Lexuan acknowledged.</span></p>
