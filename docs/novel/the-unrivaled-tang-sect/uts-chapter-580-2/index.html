 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes revealed a trace of ice-cold light as he stretched his arms out to his sides. Circles of icy blue light rippled from his Icy War God’s Armor one after another, and formless ice elements condensed toward his body at an incredible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Star Anise Icy Coagulation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu suddenly howled, and it sounded like a dragon’s roar as his soul rings rose from beneath his feet. A formidable aura emerged and flourished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s soul rings only had two colors: black and red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s expression changed drastically out of fear when he saw those soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s soul rings weren’t like that when they had last battled, but he had six black and three red soul rings now! His combination wasn’t that much inferior to Huo Yuhao’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The colors of a soul master’s soul rings didn’t mean everything, but they were a symbol of a soul master’s strength. Furthermore, Zhongli Wu was an evil soul master, and he was a Transcendent Douluo. The Holy Ghost Church’s supreme leader was stronger than anyone had expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression grew solemn. He was aware that after his previous four battles’ consumption, his battle against Zhongli Wu would be the hardest moment today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the previous evil soul masters’ cultivation ranks were lower than Huo Yuhao’s, then Zhongli Wu’s true strength was definitely comparable to Huo Yuhao, and possibly even stronger. Huo Yuhao’s only advantage was his two soul cores. His chances of victory against Zhongli would also decide his chances of success in this one-versus-ten contest. This battle would determine the outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu pointed his right hand into the air as a black soul ring flickered on his body, and an enormous staff appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This staff was black all over, and another silhouette appeared behind his back when it appeared. This figure didn’t seem very big, about the same size as Zhongli Wu’s body. However, everyone who was watching could feel their hearts constrict when this shadow appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe had crossed paths with Zhongli Wu before, and even he wasn’t entirely sure what Zhongli Wu’s martial soul was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s expression had become incredibly solemn as he watched in the distance. He muttered under his breath, “Back then, Ye Xishui’s martial soul mutated into a Blood Soul Demonpuppet. Zhongli Wu’s martial soul seems superior to Ye Xishui’s martial soul, and it must have mutated once more. But for some reason, it feels extraordinarily powerful. Its origins must be similar to Ye Xishui’s Blood Soul Demonpuppet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Xishui’s Blood Soul Demonpuppet is a martial soul that improves continuously by nourishing itself with human souls. This is one of the most important reasons why Elder Mu couldn’t approve of her anymore, no matter what. Many humans have perished at Ye Xishui’s hands, and Zhongli Wu’s martial soul should have the same characteristics as hers. I just don’t know how powerful he can be. This battle will be very difficult for Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe forced a laugh and said, “What this child is doing is too risky. He’s challenging the Sun Moon Empire’s powerful individuals all by himself. He really…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan shook his head gently. “I can understand what he’s thinking. He’s laying down the foundations for his future. At the same time, he really is confident to some extent. Perhaps he is estimating his chances at fifty percent, but fifty percent is enough to try. As long as he can complete this battle peacefully, then no matter who he faces afterwards, he will definitely be able to escape with his life even if he loses in the end. And if he lives after today’s episode, then he will undoubtedly give everyone a big surprise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Yan Shaozhe glanced at Elder Xuan in surprise. “Surprise? What surprise?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan glanced back at Yan Shaozhe and said, “We are soul masters, and we have to deal with any problem rationally. However, once our cultivation rank reaches a certain standard, we have to be passionate, and we have to be crazy, besides just accumulating and working hard. I have lacked this insanity, and that’s the reason why I have dallied for so long. What Yuhao is doing is relying on external forces to fully unleash his potential. When he obtained his second soul core, his potential far exceeded ours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe started to think. Using battles to unleash one’s potential? He did want to do that, but at his cultivation, finding a suitable opponent who could threaten his life was just too difficult. There were some in Shrek Academy, but who in the academy would wish to fight with him to the death? A showdown with outsiders to the death was too dangerous, and it was hard to find such opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had just recently obtained his second soul core, and he was doing this to train himself so that he could fuse with his two soul cores even more perfectly and seamlessly. He also wanted to stimulate his immense potential at the same time so that he could prepare for the future. The future? What was Huo Yuhao’s future like?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe couldn’t tell what Huo Yuhao’s future would be like anymore. He was only praying for him, praying that he could emerge victorious against Zhongli Wu in this battle. However, he didn’t approve of how Huo Yuhao was forcefully pressuring himself. He was up against a powerful evil soul master. How dangerous was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Zhongli Wu’s battle had begun in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu didn’t attack Huo Yuhao at once. He tapped his staff in the air as a deep howling sound could be heard, and the enormous head of some beast appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surprisingly, it was a dragon’s head. It was entirely black, but it emanated translucent green light as intense green flames danced within its eyes. Chilly and sinister winds billowed through the air as the dragon head appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe had crossed paths with Zhongli Wu before, but he had been incinerating himself back then so that he could buy time for his companions, while Zhongli Wu didn’t give his full strength in that battle. Yan Shaozhe now watched as Zhongli Wu suddenly released an enormous dragon head. This dragon head seemed to be related to his martial soul, yet it seemed like it wasn’t. Yan Shaozhe was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How powerful is Zhongli Wu, exactly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not many people in the Holy Ghost Church knew what Zhongli Wu’s true power was like, not to mention Yan Shaozhe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enormous dragon head wasn’t the end, it was just the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its large black frame gradually snaked out, and the dragon’s claw quickly reached out as the dragon slowly revealed its tremendous body. This was a giant black dragon! However, the differences were that this black dragon didn’t have scales, muscles, or flesh, but was formed entirely from black bones. Even then, this black dragon’s aura was comparable to that of an actual dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t attack Zhongli Wu as he was releasing his dragon. Instead, he just hovered quietly in midair and waited. He had his Icy War God’s Armor covering him, so nobody could see his expression, while he was using Star Anise Icy Coagulation to swiftly recover his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why didn’t Huo Yuhao take this opportunity to attack? Shrek Academy’s various elders were all worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black bone dragon took ten seconds to appear fully in front of everyone. The dragon was a hundred meters long, and its wingspan was also about a hundred meters wide. This size wasn’t considered much compared to a top-tier individual’s martial soul true body. Soul masters like Elder Xuan’s martial soul true body could easily reach a thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this black bone dragon looked almost material! Furthermore, all sorts of illusions and images flickered in the sky as it appeared. There were mountains of corpses and seas of blood, and they all belonged to soul beasts. There were countless soul beasts’ agonizing cries echoing through the heavens, like there were uncountable avenging beast spirits crying out hysterically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How many soul beasts did Zhongli Wu have to kill to create something like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was standing on the enormous bone dragon’s skull. He was very small compared to the bone dragon, but he gave off a stifling feeling that created a terrifying pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I discovered this set of dragon bones in some historical remains. The dragon’s soul hadn’t dissipated back then. Even though the dragon itself isn’t considered a top-tier draconic species, and even though its bloodline isn’t even pure, this dragon has a tinge of the Silver Dragon on its body. You’ve probably heard of the history of the dragons, that the Dragon God split into the Golden Dragon King and the Silver Dragon King. In addition to the nine sons of the Dragon God, they were considered kings of their species. Their descendants all have a little of their blood in them. But the truth is, there are still some other secrets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only the Dragon God’s nine sons passed on their bloodline. The Golden Dragon King and the Silver Dragon King had no offspring. The Golden Dragon King met its demise for some unknown reason after the split, while the Silver Dragon King disappeared. That was the reason why the dragons fell from grace. However, the Dragon God released large amounts of energy when he split into the two dragon kings. Some of that energy contained the Golden Dragon King’s Ultimate Strength and the Silver Dragon King’s control of the elements. Those dragons who were bathing in the Dragon God’s favor were partially affected by those energies, and their claims afterward about how they possessed the Golden Dragon King or the Silver Dragon King’s bloodline arises from this fact.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Silver Dragon King blessed this dragon when it was still alive, therefore, the dragon’s soul is undying, while it also possesses part of the Silver Dragon King’s powers. This dragon is the strongest beast spirit among those that I possess, and it took me ten years to capture it, and I couldn’t receive any external help during that period of time. Ten years later, the dragon’s strength enabled me to break through directly to become a Transcendent Douluo. Subsequently, I took over as the Holy Ghost Church’s supreme leader.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Normally, I would never use this dragon’s power, because it has become my origin beast spirit, and even part of my martial soul. Today, you can be proud that you’ve forced me to unleash my Bone Dragon King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s voice was deep and cold. The Bone Dragon King’s aura became a little stronger, and the sky a little darker, with every syllable he uttered. Zhongli Wu’s soul rings flickered amid the black light from the beginning to the end, and nobody could tell whether he was using his soul skills.</span></p>
