 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi had already felt that something was amiss when the Ice Bear King had transformed into an icy meteor. She had realized that Huo Yuhao was no longer on its shoulder after it had turned into a meteor. However, Elder Su had been completely focused on Er Bai’s massive body and powerful aura. He had totally forgotten about the deadly opponent he was up against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bright blue light instantly reached Elder Su the moment it had appeared before everyone’s eyes. On top of that, it was able to determine exactly where Elder Su would try to dodge. Huo Yuhao’s attack was built on his ability to predict Elder Su’s thoughts and actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Elder Su’s head was penetrated by the light, there was no chance of him surviving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi closed her eyes as sadness and pain overwhelmed her heart. She had lost another valuable subordinate. This meant that she had already lost two Class 9 soul engineers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was only the seventh round. If he were actually able to win all ten rounds, it meant that Huo Yuhao would be taking three more Class 9 soul engineers from her army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, I can’t let it go on like this. Even if the army’s morale suffers, I have to make sure we don’t lose any more Class 9 soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Ju Zi knew that she had been duped by Huo Yuhao right from the start. Even though she was a very scheming person, she had still fallen prey to his ploy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was now obvious that Huo Yuhao had used himself as bait to initiate this challenge. However, Ju Zi had forgotten how people from the Shrek Academy were the best when it came to one-on-one battles!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without their linked defensive soul tools or linked offensive soul tools, soul engineers did not possess much of an advantage against soul masters of a similar cultivation during one-on-one battles. This advantage was something that all of them, including Ju Zi, had taken for granted after their previous victories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi closed her eyes before sighing guiltily. She said, “Let’s admit defeat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, Marshal. We have not lost yet. We are willing to take him on.” After seeing Elder Su die, the other Class 9 soul engineers were now extremely furious. This was because Elder Su was usually the friendliest one among them. After watching two of their comrades die, the fear in their hearts had been taken over by rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have already said it! We are going to admit defeat! This is an order.” Ju Zi suddenly opened her eyes and exclaimed furiously. “I can’t watch all of you die like this. We have made a mistake right from the beginning. We should never have agreed to fight one-on-one with people from Shrek Academy. We have been tricked. Now that we have lost, we must admit defeat. I will bear all of the consequences. Spread my orders and get the army to retreat immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, Ju ZI turned around as she strode towards the Sun Moon Empire’s army camp. Her voice was also transmitted by a sound amplifying soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao, I admit that we have lost this time. However, our battle has only just begun. I really hope that you will be this lucky the next time around. Everyone from the Sun Moon Empire, retreat now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The powerful soul engineers and the soul engineer legions from the Sun Moon Empire started to retreat slowly. As the rage in their hearts started to fade away, the Class 9 soul engineers started to feel relieved that they did not have to fight that frightening young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it looked as though he was pretty close to his limits, they knew that Huo Yuhao still had Er Bai around. In addition, they did not know what other trump cards he might be hiding up his sleeves. Hence, this was a challenge no one would willingly accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, we all only have one life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint light was sparkling around Huo Yuhao as he rapidly absorbed the ice-type elements in the air to replenish what he had lost during the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he had only managed to survive till now because of the powerful regenerative ability granted by his Yin Yang Complement soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had heard Ju Zi’s voice very clearly, and was a little disappointed to know that they had given up. After all, he really did possess more trump cards. If not for all of these trump cards he had hidden up his sleeve, he would never have proposed this challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Huo Yuhao was still holding onto the ring that had belonged to the legion commander of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion. He knew well enough that there were plenty of stationary soul cannon shells in it—including several Class 9 ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were really forced into a corner and caught in a life-threatening situation, Huo Yuhao would not hesitate to use these stationary soul cannon shells and expose the fact that he had killed the legion commander of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the day, those were Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells! Regardless of whether they were used against the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions or their Class 9 soul engineers, they would definitely hurt his opponents. At the very least, they would be able to buy him enough time to rest up and recover the energy he had expended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could still remember the humongous stationary soul cannon shell launcher Teacher Xuan had designed specifically for Er Bai very clearly. That toy would definitely be able to allow him to launch multiple Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was indeed very smart. At the same time, she had the gumption and courage to make difficult decisions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, Huo Yuhao was no longer afraid of revealing the fact that he had killed the legion commander of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion. After all, he had already killed two Transcendent Douluo from the Holy Ghost Church and injured Zhongli Wu. At the same time, he had managed to save Ma Xiaotao. Under such circumstances, the Holy Ghost Church must have been weakened tremendously. Even if the Sun Moon Empire were to continue to receive help from them, they would not be much of a threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, whether he was able to make them the scapegoat was no longer that important. The most important thing was to kill as many Class 9 soul engineers from the Sun Moon Empire as possible. If more of them were to die, there would be fewer powerful individuals who could pin Shrek Academy down. That would then be a huge success for the academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he watched the soul engineer legions retreat, Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath. At the end of the day, the place he was currently waiting at was not safe. It would also be better for him to return to Shrek City before he began his recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when he was about to jump down from Er Bai’s body, an extremely peculiar sensation suddenly swept across his body. It was as though someone was trying to choke him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately activated his Yin Yang Complement soul cores as he tried to break free from this sensation. However, it was already too late. His current ability paled in comparison to his ability when he was at his peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black streaks of energy started to evaporate from the Icy War God’s Armor as a black figure formed behind him. A matte black dagger also formed before it was suddenly thrust at Huo Yuhao’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Huo Yuhao’s entire body was sealed. He was completely immobilized. There was no way he could avoid the dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, a loud scream suddenly echoed in the air at this critical moment. Following which, a streak of purple-gold instantly appeared before Huo Yuhao, almost as though it had teleported there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, Huo Yuhao’s body was still stabbed by the black dagger. However, another figure had also appeared behind his back. She was none other than Tang Wutong, whose entire body was now radiating an intense purple-gold glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right after Ju Zi had announced their retreat, Tang Wutong was the first person to rush forward from Shrek Academy’s side. After all, she was the one who understood Huo Yuhao’s current situation best. When she saw how he was losing his balance on Er Bai’s shoulder, she knew that he was definitely not acting this time round. He must have expended too much energy, and sustained injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she wanted to be there for her man at the first moment to protect and treat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the black figure started to form behind Huo Yuhao’s back, Tang Wutong was already less than a hundred meters from him. At that instant, she ignited her soul power and used their martial soul fusion skill to appear right behind Huo Yuhao’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had four martial soul fusion skills in total. Their last one was the Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost, Raiment of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a skill that allowed both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong to fuse their powers to unleash a stronger fighting power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When either of them executed this skill, the powers they possessed would draw both of them closer. Tang Wutong had used this skill along with her teleportation ability to attach herself to Huo Yuhao’s body. When the dagger was about to pierce both of them, Tang Wutong was able to separate Huo Yuhao from her on time. She had used her body to block the dagger for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After releasing a grunt, Tang Wutong’s body suddenly released an unbelievably powerful aura. The purple-gold light she was emitting made her look like a purple-gold sun behind Huo Yuhao. Its intense radiant aura instantly caused the black energy to surge violently, and no longer be able to attack Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was finally able to move again. When he turned around to find that Tang Wutong had been stabbed in the chest, he felt as though his mind was about to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately extended his arm to bring Tang Wutong into his embrace. Huo Yuhao released a deafening howl as he slammed his right first outwards in the direction of the black figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was apparent that the black figure was a physical manifestation of the Death God’s power. This power originated from the Death God Demonpuppet. Yes, Zhongli Wu had never fled from where they had fought. In fact, he had planted his powers on Huo Yuhao’s body in advance. Even Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was not able to pick it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power of the Death God was only activated when Huo Yuhao was at his weakest and most relaxed state. After all, Zhongli Wu’s targets had always been Huo Yuhao and Er Bai. It was now clear that the Leader of the Holy Ghost Church had made alternative plans all along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, an image silently formed behind Huo Yuhao’s back. Tang Wutong could see very clearly that the image was of a young man with long golden hair. Even though the young man had a smile on his face, Tang Wutong could not help but notice how the man’s pupils were radiating different colored lights. One of his eyes was a black vortex, while the other was a white vortex. This gave him an extremely peculiar look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A very special aura started to form on Huo Yuhao’s body. The fist he had punched out was originally radiating a golden light. However, while it was on its way to hit the black figure, the light it was giving off instantly transformed into a black and white vortex of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” When the light of Huo Yuhao’s fist slammed into the black image, the image tried to resist it. However, the golden-haired man behind Huo Yuhao suddenly emitted an overwhelming radiance as the vortex on Huo Yuhao's fist released a mystical power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong could sense the powerful melancholy and sadness radiating from the vortex on Huo Yuhao's fist. Following which, the black image was shredded to pieces by the vortex before it vanished into thin air.</span></p>
