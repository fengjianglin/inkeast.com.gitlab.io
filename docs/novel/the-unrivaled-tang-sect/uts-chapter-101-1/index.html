 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 101.1: The Embryo Of A Hundred Thousand Year Soul Beast</strong></p>
 <p>“Teacher Wang.” In a rare occurrence, Ling Luochen spoke. She appeared to be irritated. “Isn’t the Starlight Auction House being deceitful, knowing that the soul bone they are auctioning is flawed?” She had been moved by Huo Yuhao’s words earlier too. She was wondering about the prospect of being able to fuse with this soul bone. If this soul bone was flawed, it would be in the best interest of the Starlight Auction House to sell it to them. After all, Huo Yuhao possessed an ultimate ice martial soul, which was very uncommon.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan waved towards her and said, “Don’t fret.”</p>
 <p>Qing Ya came towards Wang Yan and whispered a few words to him.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan laughed slightly and said, “I’ve guessed that it’d be like this already. We’ll wait here. Isn’t there a last auction item? Let us take a look at it and see what can be more valuable than the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone.”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Wang Yan’s expression, Ma Xiaotao and Dai Yaoheng were both relieved. They seemed to have understood something too. Bei Bei, He Caitou and Xu Sanshi all grinned too. Xu Sanshi even took the initiative to answer Jiang Nannan’s doubts.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was initially as irritated as Ling Luochen. Only when Huo Yuhao muttered a few words into his ear did he seemed to be enlightened. Xiao Xiao was at a loss though. Ling Luochen continued to furrow her brows, but did not say anything.</p>
 <p>As this Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament continued, Wang Yan was gaining further recognition from his students based on his profound knowledge and hard work.</p>
 <p>“Next, we have our final auction item.”</p>
 <p>The image on the soul screen turned golden. As the golden light receded, Princess Jiu Jiu appeared on the screen wearing a long, golden skirt.</p>
 <p>Her milky-white skin didn’t lose its beauty and elegance when paired with the graceful and luxurious golden palace skirt. The tailoring of the skirt fitted her body to a tee, and even managed to accentuate her curves.</p>
 <p>Qing Ya had already said before that wearing the golden auction attire signified that the auction item that was about to be presented next could potentially achieve a bid of over 100 million golden soul coins.</p>
 <p>Although no one knew what that auction item was going to be, they were excited upon seeing Princess Jiu Jiu’s change of attire. In this top-ranked auction, she was indeed capable of getting everyone to their feet!</p>
 <p>“Distinguished guests, we can tell how valuable this final auction item will be just by looking at Princess Jiu jiu’s dress. Honestly speaking, it’s also my first time seeing this auction item in my entire life. From my viewpoint, the value of this item can no longer be judged using money.”</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu jiu showed some minor changes again after changing into this golden skirt. She was different from her previous self, which appeared to be more seductive. Right now, her tone of voice was more serious. Her expression was also more serious. Just by saying a few words, others could sense her sincerity. They even could not help but believe every single word that she said.</p>
 <p>“I shall not reveal the name of this auction item yet. I shall give a brief introduction of what its effects are. The Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone earlier was already very scarce and rare. As for this final auction item, it’s even more unique. Its price is even immeasurable using money.”</p>
 <p>“It’s an item that can only expended once. More specifically, it’s medicinal in nature, and there’s only one of it. Distinguished guests, please take a look.” As she spoke, Princess Jiu jiu waved her right hand, and a change occurred on the soul screen. There was one more white tray that appeared on the screen. On that tray, there was another wooden tray. This wooden tray was embedded with at least a hundred jewels of various colors. Above this average-sized wooden tray, a ball of flowing gas surged slightly.</p>
 <p>This ball of flowing gas revealed itself to be white. The tender whiteness of it undermined its strength. Furthermore, it only appeared to be a ball of flowing gas from the screen. It was difficult to sense how miraculous it was through one’s vision alone.</p>
 <p>However, this ball of flowing gas was very condensed, and did not disperse. Subtly, it seemed to be struggling, and attempting to escape some form of encirclement. The wooden tray beneath the ball of flowing gas even emanated a layer of dim golden light that engulfed the gas as the gas struggled. This stopped the gas from escaping.</p>
 <p>“All of you must be very curious. What exactly is this item? When I saw it for the first time, I was also unable to confirm what sort of presence it is exactly. However, we have confirmed its detailed form through countless research attempts. Never underestimate this ball of flowing gas. It’s even a blessing just to see it today. Although it’s a little disrespectful to say this as an auctioneer, I can’t think of another way to describe how valuable and rare it is other than using this method.</p>
 <p>“All of you should be aware that in the world of soul beasts, there’s a situation. After a soul beast reaches 100,000 years of cultivation, it will have a choice. If it continues to cultivate, it has to rely on its powerful innate talent to challenge the bottleneck that could potentially dissipate its soul. If the bottleneck is overcome, we would then name it a transcendent soul beast until it reaches 200,000 years of cultivation. Among transcendent soul beasts, we call the most powerful ten of them the Ten Great Savage Beasts. It’s fair to say that they are the elites among the soul beasts.”</p>
 <p>“However, not all soul beasts will choose this path after they reach 100,000 years of cultivation. There’s another choice that they can make. They can re-cultivate to become human. To carry this out, they must convert themselves into the most primitive form of humans. They must exist in the form of an embryo first before continuing to cultivate in order to increase their cultivation. As long as they can cultivate all the way till the 7th ring, they will be able to become true humans. For such soul beasts, they are almost certainly able to reach the level of Transcendent Douluo. However, it’s more uncommon for soul beasts to choose this path compared to the previous one. Why?”</p>
 <p>“That’s because it’s equivalent to them forsaking all their previous cultivation once they choose to be reborn. Besides retaining their soul skills and relieving themselves of the need to kill a soul beast to replenish themselves, their bodies will be as weak as the bodies of humans. Regardless of whether it’s the soul beasts themselves or the most powerful human soul masters, they can also sense the difference between these soul beasts and humans. Such soul beasts with 100,000 years of cultivation are the prime targets to be hunted and slain by human soul masters. If we say that 1 out of 10 soul beasts survive by choosing the previous path, it’s fair to say that none of them will survive if they choose this path. As a result, there have been fewer and fewer soul beasts who will make such a choice. This is unless if they are able to cultivate till 100,000 years based on luck, or if their lineage is extremely poor.”</p>
 <p>“After saying so much, I reckon that some of you will be thinking that I am saying stuff that all of you are already aware of, and there’s no need for me to remind all of you of this. However, I must clarify that what I’m saying is not gibberish. What I’m saying is closely related to this, the final item of today’s auction. This ball of flowing gas is a soul beast with 100,000 years of cultivation that was captured by someone powerful after it reached its bottleneck and decided to re-cultivate into a human. After that, it was trapped in a Class 9 Godsealing Altar.</p>
 <p>After hearing Jiu Jiu’s words, the entire room went silent, including Wang Yan. Everyone was astounded.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was still immersed in his expectations for the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone, but he opened his mouth wide in shock when he heard Princess Jiu Jiu’s words.</p>
 <p>A soul beast was captured and trapped in the process of turning into a human, when it was in its embryonic state. What did this mean? This meant that a 100,000 year soul beast could be easily slain. As a result, a hundred thousand year soul ring and soul bone could be obtained. But at the same time, this signified immense cruelty too!</p>
 <p>Undoubtedly, this Class 9 soul engineer must have come from the Sun Moon Empire. That’s because only the Sun Moon Empire possessed a soul engineer of such a level.</p>
 <p>This was indeed a treasure! A hundred thousand year soul ring and soul bone were indeed the most valuable treasures currently in the world. It was tremendously arduous to obtain them, not to even mention capturing a 100,000 year soul beast. The temptation to get ahold of this embryo was very great. No wonder Princess Jiu Jiu had donned the golden auctioneering clothes.</p>
 <p>An item worth 100 million golden soul coins was undoubtedly a staggering figure. But compared to a 100,000 year soul beast, there were those who were willing to fork out this sum of money!</p>
 <p>However, this was not the end of the shock for everyone.</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu Jiu beamed with a smile and said, “Distinguished guests, am I right that all of you are stunned now? I shouldn’t be wrong. However, there are even more astonishing things that I haven’t revealed yet. According to the research information provided by the Sun Moon Empire regarding this embryo, this 100,000 year soul beast embryo’s memory was also sealed when it was solidified into this state. Besides the fact that it can provide a hundred thousand year soul ring and soul bone, this means that it can be easily absorbed. Of course, the powers of the Class 9 Godsealing Altar have to be tapped into during the process of absorption. Moreover, the probability of it being absorbed directly might not be huge. However, an entire martial soul could be obtained by the person absorbing it if it’s successful, and all the powers of the soul beast could be absorbed. If this is true, a martial soul that can be added with 9 soul rings is much superior than a soul ring or a soul bone.”</p>
 <p>Silence. Not only was the room that Huo Yuhao and the rest were in silent, all the participants of the auction were also completely hushed. However, their breathing became heavier and heavier.</p>
