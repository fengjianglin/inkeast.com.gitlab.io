 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao began to chant his incantations in a low and deep voice. Under the influence of his Imitation and his Spiritual Interference Domain, no one could hear his incantations nor sensed what he was doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi took a deep breath before letting it out. She was no longer able to make decisions as the Commander of the Three Armies. The strength Huo Yuhao had demonstrated was extremely suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How? What should I do next?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The usually quick-witted Ju Zi found her mind completely blank. While she was not willing to see Huo Yuhao die, she knew that if the Sun Moon Empire were to lose this challenge, the entire army’s morale would take a huge hit. Everything she had done prior to this would go down the drain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me do it!” A loud exclamation rang out from beside her. Elder Su, who had been standing next to Ju Zi, strode out to face Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi opened her mouth and wanted to stop him. However, no words escaped her. Even though she did not want to put Huo Yuhao’s life in danger, she knew that she could not allow the morale of the army to be shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Elder Su slowly walked towards the center of the battlefield, the various sool tools he had brought with him started to appear. The people who were watching the battle could hear the crisp metallic sounds as Elder Su’s human-shaped soul tool started to form on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao stared at Elder Su, the pupils in his eyes contracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was able to tell from today’s battles that the Sun Moon Empire must have mastered the core technology used to build human-shaped soul tools. In addition, they must have developed a certain method to use these human-shaped soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s research had shown that one needed significant spiritual power in order to exercise the precise control needed for a human-shaped soul tool to fit perfectly with one’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that the stronger the human-shaped soul tool was, the more spiritual power it consumed. Without superior spiritual power, it would be next to impossible to control a human-shaped soul tool like one’s limbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao did not find it strange that these Class 9 soul engineers had their own human-shaped soul tools. He was more interested to find out how the other soul engineers within the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion were able to use human-shaped soul tools. They must have used some sort of special method in order to achieve that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are very powerful! I am very impressed with what you have achieved at such a tender age. I must say you are the most gifted soul master I have ever seen in my life. Unfortunately, we serve different masters. Whatever strength and power you possess will only become a greater justification for us to kill you. I promise I will destroy you at all costs.” Elder Su said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared calmly at him and said, “Then let’s begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge black gate suddenly formed behind him, following which, a massive body emerged after releasing a deafening howl. It was none other than the Jiangshi Ice Bear King, Er Bai!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Huo Yuhao was facing his seventh opponent, he could not help but call for reinforcements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao leapt upward before landing on Er Bai’s shoulder. Following which, he sat cross-legged his shoulder as though he were glued there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Er Bai looked up into the sky before releasing another deafening howl as it started to stomp towards Elder Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Su revealed a condescending look. It was important to note that he was not a close-combat soul engineer, but one who specialized in ranged attacks. Even though Er Bai was humongous, and radiated an intensely powerful aura, it was nothing more than a clumsy target in Elder Su’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two red cannons appeared on the shoulder plates of his human-shaped soul tool. Those two cannons were not very big, but they instantly released two red soul rays towards Er Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a soul engineer became a Class 9 soul engineer, the power of their soul tools could no longer be measured by their size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Er Bai was so big, it was an easy target even if Elder Su did not aim properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, an unexpected outcome formed before everyone’s eyes. Just when the two rays were about to land on Er Bai, Er Bai charged forward, and &nbsp;suddenly angled his body in an agile manner. In fact, it even pushed itself off the ground with the tips of its feet to avoid the two rays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” Elder Su’s eyes widened in disbelief. After all, he had only launched his soul rays after he had locked his cannons onto Er Bai.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How was it able to avoid the rays?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Interference Domain and Spiritual Detection Sharing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the answer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Huo Yuhao’s answer to the challenge Elder Su had given!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Elder Su was hesitating, Er Bai had gotten extremely close to him. It waved its humongous fist and planted it in Elder Su’s direction. Its overwhelming aura caused the surrounding ground to sink even before its fist came into contact with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Su instantly retreated rapidly in a bid to evade Er Bai’s attack as two streaks of light were released from the bottom of his feet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Er Bai looked up into the sky as it released another low growl. It opened its mouth as its white smoky breath surged out at Elder Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge circular gem that was attached at the front of Elder Su’s human-shaped soul tool suddenly emitted a powerful beam of light. The beam instantly went past the breath Er Bai had released and landed on Er Bai’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with the help of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing, Er Bai was simply too big and too close to avoid this attack. Hence, it could only use its strong chest to take this blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the powerful speed his human-shaped soul tool had given him, Elder Su was able to instantly retreat and avoid Er Bai’s breath after releasing his attack. This allowed him to widen the distance between him and Er Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was shocked to see that Er Bai was able to shake off any effect the beam had on its body. Following which, it continued to charge towards Elder Su.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How is this possible? That was a Class 8 Goldmelting Cannon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that even a Class 9 soul engineer was not able to only possess Class 9 soul tools. This was because it was incredibly difficult to build Class 9 soul tools. On top of that, it often took too much time to build them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tools like milk bottles were a lot less useful for soul engineers of higher classes. They simply did not have the time to replenish what they had expended. At the end of the day, one’s soul core was still the most reliable source of soul power. Hence, it was extremely logical to see powerful soul engineers equip themselves with soul tools of different classes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Goldmelting Cannon was only a Class 8 soul tool, it was able to melt gold and any other similar metals. On top of that, it was focused on a single target. Hence, it was extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it only left a faint black mark on the gigantic bear’s body. It didn’t seem like it had managed to cause much harm to Er Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that end of the day, there was still a difference between Er Bai and Little Bai. Little Bai was a powerful controller of ice and snow. Even though Er Bai had inherited Little Bai’s body, it did not inherit Little Bai’s ability to control ice and snow. Or rather, Er Bai only possessed a tiny bit of control over snow and ice. However, Er Bai also had its very own advantage—its immensely tough body. After becoming a spectral creature within the spectral demiplane, its body was affected by the aura within it, and had mutated. It definitely possessed the strongest body within the entire spectral demiplane. If not, it would never have become the king of the entire spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, it was extremely difficult for a Class 8 soul tool to harm Er Bai. On top of that, the Goldmelting Cannon was a fire-type soul tool. It was natural for its effect to be weaker on Er Bai, who was an ice-type spectral creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Er Bai stomped its left foot on the ground as it sent tremors and vibrations across the earth around it. As the earth trembled, everyone, including the Sun Moon Empire troops who were about five kilometers away, found the ground beneath them shaking and vibrating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By borrowing the reactive force from its stomp, Er Bai leapt into the air before rolling itself into a ball. Following which, it flew towards Elder Su like a massive rotating cannonball. The aura it possessed was similar to that of an icy meteor falling from the sky. This was the only ice ability Little Bai had passed on to Er Bai. Even though its Ultimate Ice ability was lacking compared to Little Bai’s, Er Bai’s physical power was definitely more powerful than what Little Bai could achieve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After recovering from his momentary shock, Elder Su immediately regained the speed he had lost. To be honest, he was not in the least bit scared of Er Bai. After all, speed was his specialty. On top of that, his Class 9 human-shaped soul tool was able to prevent him from being locked on by his opponent. This meant that Er Bai would never be able to lock onto his position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a single flicker, Elder Su was able to maneuver his body and avoid Er Bai’s attack. At the same time, a matte black Class 9 soul cannon appeared on his shoulder. Since the Class 8 soul tool was not enough to take Er Bai down, Elder Su had decided to go with a Class 9 one. This time around, he also made sure to choose one which was not fire-type.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Attacking power had never been a problem for any Class 9 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just when Elder Su had finally locked onto Er Bai’s position and fully charged his Class 9 soul cannon, his spiritual sea suddenly alerted him of an impending threat. This was an instinct which only Titled Douluo possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Su was extremely trusting of his senses. This was because they had saved his life countless times. Without hesitating, he immediately stopped charging the soul tool on his shoulder as he flipped around and revved up his human-shaped soul tool in a bid to escape from whatever that was coming for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blue light suddenly flickered in the sky as Elder Su’s rapid flipping motion suddenly froze. Following which, his body suddenly released a huge blood mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one were to pay close attention to Elder Su, one would notice a single hole in his Class 9 protective soul barrier, invincible barrier, and human-shaped soul tool which all lined up. Even though the hole was not very big, it was sufficient for it to be fatal. This was because they had all appeared at Elder Su’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” Er Bai’s massive body landed onto the ground. Following which, a figure gradually appeared on its shoulder. He was none other than Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was no longer sitting down and meditating on its shoulder. He was now standing on Er Bai’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A streak of blue light made a parabolic path in the air before returning to his original position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Su’s dead body fell from the sky and landed heavily on the ground. There was no longer any reaction from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had ended. The seventh battle had ended just like this. Another Class 9 soul engineer had fallen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one knew why and how Elder Su had fallen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body was swaying from left to right, but he grabbed Er Bai’s head and managed to steady himself. Following which, he sat back down on Er Bai’s shoulder. This time, he did not push the Sun Moon Empire for their next representative like before. Instead, he quietly sat down cross-legged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s face had turned very pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the beginning until now, the gigantic ice bear had just been a decoy. It was a decoy that had attracted Elder Su’s attention! Huo Yuhao was still the one who dealt the final blow.</span></p>
