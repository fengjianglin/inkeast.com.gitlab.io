 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi shook his head and answered, “Bombing their munitions warehouses is only our way of attracting their attention. In fact, you can’t imagine how heavily guarded they are. That’s why we just need to create chaos by bombing them. After that, we’ll try to assassinate Xu Tianran. At the same time, there’s another mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked, “There’s another mission? The White Tiger Duke didn’t tell me anything!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi said, “That’s because this important mission is supposed to be completed by the Heavenly Sun Douluo and myself. Only the two of us know our true goal. Your Spiritual Detection is very strong. That’s something we hadn’t thought of before. Don’t worry, we’ll won’t give you the most difficult task. We’ve already planned everything out. We hope that you can receive us when we finish it, no matter whether we succeed or fail. Your job is to ensure that the Titled Douluo involved in this mission can escape successfully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Huo Yuhao instantly heaved a sigh of relief. It was great that he didn’t need to be exposed to danger. The Sun Moon Empire was a lion’s den. If even Du Busi was being so prudent, it showed how difficult the upcoming mission was. It was best that he didn’t need to be directly part of it. As for receiving them, that was the least he could do. Ensuring that the strength of the three empires in the original Douluo Continent was preserved was very critical in stopping the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll do my best to help everyone escape.” Huo Yuhao agreed without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi was pleased, and he smiled. “Alright, we’ll plan an escape route. When the time comes, you shall receive us from this route. Whether we succeed or not, you should help everyone who returns. Once we meet you, our safety will be in your hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t agree immediately this time. He thought for a moment before nodding and saying, “Alright, I’ll do my best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi didn’t immediately reveal the escape route. Rather, he reached into his pocket and retrieved a small booklet before passing it to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s a pity that you met Mu En instead of me. I’m giving you this booklet. Take it as a reward for helping us this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The booklet was the size of a palm, but Huo Yuhao was astonished to find out that it was very heavy when he received it. It had to weigh at least five kilos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The booklet was dim gold. There were four exquisitely written words on the cover, “Secrets of the Body”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned when he saw these four words. He immediately lifted his head to look at Du Busi, but only saw a gentle look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder, I can’t take this. It’s too…” Huo Yuhao subconsciously passed the booklet back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi waved him off and refused to take the booklet back. He calmly said, “Do you know how much the Body Sect has suffered during the fight between the Heavenly Soul Empire and the Sun Moon Empire at the border?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Almost two-thirds of the elites in the Body Sect have died, including our few most talented soul masters from the younger generation. The Body Sect is only still around because I survived. However, once I die, the Body Sect will perish along with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sun Moon Empire is much stronger than I expected. In the past, I was too self-absorbed and self-confident. When we secretly attacked the Sun Moon Empire, we even dealt a huge blow to the Illustrious Virtue Hall. Then, I was so confident that we could deal with them. However, that seems like a joke now. I was just like a frog in a well. I lost my relevance, which led to our destruction. However, I believe that the Body Sect can still survive. All the soul masters in the Body Sect are uniquely talented. Your martial soul is also a body soul. You should be able to sense the difference between a martial soul and a body soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are much more talented than ordinary soul masters, and we can comprehend things better. This allows us to complete the fusion of our soul and spiritual power more easily. In terms of abilities, we are far beyond those evil soul masters who don’t have any future. However, we lost. But we didn’t lose in terms of talent or abilities, but our vision. It was my mistake. That’s why I have to do something for the sect no matter what.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This booklet contains many secrets of body souls. It’s also the most important collection in the Body Sect. Only the Body Douluo can inherit this booklet. I’m lending it to you temporarily. If I survive this mission, return it to me. If I die, please send it to Shrek Academy and ask the academy to return it to the Body Sect. In the meantime, I permit you to go through its contents.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to thank me either. I’m not just doing this to help you. At the same time, I hope to glorify body souls even further. Although you are Mu En’s disciple, that doesn’t take away the fact that you have a body soul. When your body soul becomes stronger, you’ll be a Body Douluo. Whether you are willing or not, it’s the truth. If the Body Sect perishes in the future, please help me to pass down the heritage and preserve the spirit of the sect when you meet a soul master with a body soul in the future. Take it as a payment for reading the contents of this booklet. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was there any reason for Huo Yuhao to reject it? The answer was no.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was still deep in thought when he walked out from Du Busi’s room. Yes, he wasn’t happy just because he had obtained the ‘Secrets of the Body’. From Du Busi’s words, he could tell that he wasn’t in good condition. Furthermore, it seemed like he was the only one who thought that he wouldn’t return alive. It clearly felt as if he was entrusting the book to Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t just entrusting the book. He was entrusting the entire Body Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to his own room, Huo Yuhao sat down in a chair and opened the book. Tang Wutong came to his side. When she saw the words ‘Secrets of the Body’, she was also astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao told her what Du Busi had told him quietly. After he finished, Tang Wutong furrowed her brow. “Yuhao, the Heavenly Soul Empire is done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a bitter smile on his face. He agreed with Tang Wutong. If even the Body Sect was in such bad shape that their sect leader had to entrust the entire sect to Huo Yuhao, it must mean that the Heavenly Soul Empire was doomed. Once their last line of defense fell, the entire empire would be gone. The only thing they could do now was hang on as long as they could.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the Body Douluo’s words, Huo Yuhao could tell that half of the elites of the Heavenly Soul Empire had been killed when the Sun Moon Empire first invaded Heaven Dou City. They were now truly crippled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Du Busi didn’t reveal the true goal of this mission, it seemed like this mission was very important, given that he appeared to put all his eggs into one basket. However, it might also be that he was trying to deal one last blow to the Sun Moon Empire before he died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao flipped open the first page of the book. The material used to make this book was unknown. Not only was it heavy, but it was also very tough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first page didn’t contain the contents of the book. It was a piece of paper that was stuffed into the book.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve ruled the sect for more than two hundred years, but now I’m the one who has doomed the sect. It’s my fault. My arrogance has caused the sect to fall behind the times. One is bound to be abandoned if he falls behind the times. However, this should not be happening to the Body Sect. A body soul is a godly gift. It’s a pity that I don’t have time to adapt to the times anymore. Anyone from the Body Sect should remember that soul tools are the future. In this future, we need to be able to stand out. The combination of a body soul and soul tools will be bound to astonish the world – Du Busi.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After reading these words, Huo Yuhao felt even more pressure. Given Du Busi’s identity and status, he had actually said such self-defamatory words. This could only mean that something was destined to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the last few sentences left Huo Yuhao stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had to do with the combination of body souls and soul tools.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t this the direction that Teacher Xuan and I discovered? We have a new plan because of this new path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, body souls allowed one to comprehend things better. More importantly, a specific body part of a soul master would become much stronger if that part was a body soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To put things into simpler terms, if a soul master’s martial soul was his hand, he would be able to handle much stronger soul tools using his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just like Huo Yuhao’s eyes. In his case, his eyes were able to handle much stronger soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi knew what the future was going to be like. However, just like he mentioned, he had discovered it too late. He no longer had the opportunity to adapt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gently took the piece of paper out and saw that the front page of the book was inscribed with the words ‘Godly Gift’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a paragraph of words below it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Humans are a gift of the gods. They retained the intelligence of the gods. Among humans, there are those who preserve the divine power of gods.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Body Sect clearly treated body souls as godly gifts. Although Huo Yuhao didn’t fully agree with such an idea, the sect must have their own reasoning, since it was a legacy that had been passed down for years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought until here, Huo Yuhao squinted and continued reading…</span></p>
