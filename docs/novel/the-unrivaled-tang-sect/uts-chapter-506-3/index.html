 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao calmed down as his thoughts stopped there. He would deal with problems as they came. The teachers still didn’t know that he had officially become an eight-ringed Soul Douluo, so the assessment shouldn’t be that difficult with that advantage. After all, the Academy’s teachers and even the Elders didn’t know the full depth of his abilities. He had five powerful Spirits to support him, so how could he not even pass a graduation assessment?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt a lot better after thinking things through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky had gradually darkened by this time. Light dotted the shores of the Sea God’s Lake, and Huo Yuhao could see with his Spirit Eyes that the outer courtyard students had already formed a large circle around the lake. That was especially true for those at the front, as they were squeezed right to the edge of the shore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Male students who are participating in the Blind Date, get ready!” somebody hollered at everyone, and the male students from the inner courtyard who had already gathered swiftly assembled at the lakeside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hurry, and go. Don’t be late,” Wang Yan ordered Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright! Teacher Wang, you have to go easy on me tomorrow! You have also taught me, and if I can’t pass the graduation assessment, it wouldn’t look good on you, would it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Yan laughed and said, “Nonsense! You’re part of the Sea God’s Pavilion now, and your status is much higher than mine. Furthermore, I have never really taught you anything, so I can’t help you. You’ll have to rely on yourself!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao no longer had time to continue chatting with Wang Yan, and he vanished and reappeared at the lakeside in a flash. There were so many eyes watching, and even if he was just going through the motions, he had to be a little serious. His mind was filled with tomorrow’s graduation test, and he didn’t have much energy to think about the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lake’s surface was dark, and it was hard to see anything through the rolling mists. Huo Yuhao arrived by the lakeside and stood behind the throngs of male students. He was still thinking about how he would face the test tomorrow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A large boat sailed in from the distance. The boat was completely lit up; the inner courtyard’s teachers and elders were here to observe the ceremony. Elder Xuan sat at the front of the boat, hugging that large wine bottle that he hadn’t used for a long time. There was a plate of chicken legs beside him, and he appeared as casual as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song, Yan Shaozhe, Xian Lin’er, and the other Elders, along some of the inner courtyard’s teachers, were all on the boat. Cai Mei’er was the only one who was absent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dean Cai was still dealing with a certain wretched, newly-hired teacher. When he discovered that the student from the inner courtyard who he had threatened and whose badge he had confiscated was the youngest member of the Sea God’s Pavilion in Shrek Academy’s history, he couldn’t be any more depressed. He wasn’t able to make a display of strength to the inner courtyard’s students, and instead, the inner courtyard’s students gave him one instead, using Huo Yuhao’s prestige.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like in all the previous years, there were students from the inner courtyard who were participating in the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date for the first time, and there were some who had been here before. Those who had participated before knew what was going on, while those who were here for the first time were filled with eager anticipation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life in the Academy, all studying and cultivation, was undoubtedly stale and dry. An activity like this for the young male and female students was a fantastic opportunity to display their abilities, and also a good chance to get a partner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large boat didn’t sail to the shore, instead stopping in the middle of the lake. Beams shot out from the lake’s surface, and light rippled through the air as the outer courtyard students who were here to watch erupted in cheers and applause.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were sixteen beams of light in total, all pale gold. There was a girl in a long white dress standing quietly on top of every beam, and all sixteen girls were dressed in the same manner. They wore the same conical bamboo hats as before on their heads, and a white veil three feet long draped down and covered their faces completely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing in the faint clow of the columns of light, they were just like elegant fairies on the lake’s surface. Their transcendent beauty was extremely eye-catching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light on the lake’s surface awakened Huo Yuhao from his contemplation. When he looked up at the “fairies” on the lake’s surface, he was a little dazed, and felt like his hair was standing on end. The emotional changes made his heart beat faster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! Even if he was just here to go through the motions, how could he remain calm when he was once again part of the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was almost identical to back when he had first participated. Back then, one of the girls underneath those conical bamboo hats was his Dong’er! Huo Yuhao felt like he was dreaming as he stared at the scene in front of him, and couldn’t control his emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sixteen girls were spread out in single file. They were facing the lakeside, just standing there quietly as the male students on the lakeside were eagerly raring to go. The outer courtyard students on the lakesides were probably even more excited than the participating inner courtyard students, and each cheer and applause was louder than the last.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, two slightly stronger beams of white light shot into the air, and two more figures appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were both incredibly beautiful. The one on the left was clad in a flowing white dress: Han Ruoruo! She had managed to get a change of clothes and even put on some makeup during this time, and was like a snow lotus blooming on the icy mountains as white light shone down on her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eldest senior sister, Zhang Lexuan, was naturally to her right. Just like back when he had first participated in the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date, Zhang Lexuan was in a long yellow dress, like a blooming tulip unrivaled in beauty. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer courtyard students cheered even more vigorously when the two gorgeous women appeared. The shore of Sea God’s Island was a bit further away, but they were still clearly audible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Love was the topic of eternity, and something that youths both male and female yearned for the most. The outer courtyard students were still young, and the Academy had been very strict on them. Their longings were very satisfied even if they could only watch this event. This was the first time that the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date had been opened for the outer courtyard to watch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Ruoruo raised her voice and began to speak. “The meeting of fate upon the Sea God’s Lake! Love is found in but a moment, as Shrek lives on for a hundred centuries. Welcome, everyone, to this beautiful evening by the Sea God’s Lake! The annual Sea God’s Fated Blind Date is about to begin. I am tonight’s host, and I am representing myself and my eldest senior sister to wish good luck to all students from the inner courtyard who are participating that they might find the love that they want and deserve!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the same time, welcome to all Elders from the Sea God’s Pavilion and teachers who are here to watch. I speak on behalf of the students to express our sincere gratitude to our teachers. Without your patient nurturing and support, we would not have achieved what we have today. To our juniors from the outer courtyard, if you wish to obtain a love that the Academy approves of, and to confess to the person that you love, then you have to work hard and cultivate, and try to become part of the inner courtyard one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cheers and applause erupted once more. The students from the outer courtyard, especially the male students, seemed like they were on stimulants. If not for the fact that they had to watch the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date, the beautiful Han Ruoruo’s words was enough to make them forget about how tired they were from their continuous cultivating, and they couldn’t wait to go back and continue!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was sitting in the large boat. He smiled and said, “Seems like the decision to let the little fellows from the outer courtyard watch was an extremely correct one. When the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date is over, I can guarantee that they will have a cultivation ‘climax’. The event has just begun. I’m sure the effects will be even better later on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er grunted coldly as she muttered under her breath, “Sleazy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was nothing Yan Shaozhe could do against her quip. He could only stop talking as he shook his head helplessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan continued the speech. Her voice travelled far and wide as she said, “Now, let us invite all the male students who are participating in the blind date to prepare themselves. Thirty-six pillars will appear on the lake’s surface after this, and the students closest to our Sea God’s fairies will proceed to the first round. The students at the back are not likely to receive a suitable placing in the first round. So, pay attention, everyone. No matter what methods you use, as long as you land on the leaves of the water lilies where the pillars of light are, you will have taken that spot. Do not fall into the water, as that will strip you of your right to continue in the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get ready, everyone! Three, two, one, begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thirty-six pillars of light suddenly shot out from underneath the lake’s surface. These pillars were neatly separated into three rows, every row about five meters apart from each other, and distributed equally about a hundred meters away from the female students, roughly two hundred meters away from the shore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The students from the inner courtyard immediately made their moves once Zhang Lexuan finished speaking, like bolts of lightning as they swiftly pounced towards those pillars of light. They all wanted to gain the upper hand and display their abilities, as it was the best way to gain the heart of the girls that they liked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was the only one who didn’t immediately move. Everything before him was just like how he and Dong’er had fixed their relationship! Although the people were different, everything in front of him seemed identical.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The male students had already soared into the air as they rushed towards those pillars, and Huo Yuhao slowly drifted out from the lakeside. He didn’t display any of his abilities as he followed behind, and was last as he landed on a water lily. However, he didn’t release his martial soul at all, and he even used Imitation to change his white clothes to red. He didn’t want to become the center of attention,as he was just going through the motions anyway. All he had to do was to maintain a low profile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the students were in place. The students who had obtained positions in the first row were all overjoyed, and smiled happily. Everything was difficult in the beginning, and they had a big advantage because they had finished the first step properly.
