These recruits hadn’t seemed very disciplined to them, and even though there were some who behaved well, like Huo Yuhao, the batch was generally not too impressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, these commanders truly didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to be able to restrain these recruits so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao brought his comrades and paused in front of the wok that contained the meat soup. He raised his voice and said, “All thirty recruits from First Bunk are here to eat. Greetings, large team leader.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang Tian’s expression was a lot warmer than before. He smiled and said, “Well done. Come, eat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t the first to get his meal. He took the lunch plate that Zhuang Tian passed him and turned around and passed it to the recruit behind him. He repeated this action while he continued reminding First Bunk’s recruits to keep in line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The recruits quickly got their meals in an orderly fashion before Huo Yuhao brought them to a shady place and let everyone sit down to eat. After everything had been settled, he returned to Zhuang Tian and got himself a lunch plate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your name is Tang Dong, right?” Zhuang Tian asked as he served him a bowl of meat soup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang Tian smiled faintly and said, “You’ve done well. Keep at it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, sir.” Huo Yuhao carried his food and jogged back to his bunk’s recruits, and they ate together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang Tian smiled faintly as he watched Huo Yuhao move. He nodded and said, “Not bad… he has potential. Which one of you is in charge of his bunk?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The middle-aged man that had arm-wrestled Huo Yuhao before said, “Boss, I am in charge. I am also the one who chose this fellow. He’s quite strong, at least not any weaker than I am. I didn’t expect him to be able to do this. He’s managed to keep his bunk in such order when they’ve only just entered the army camp. He has some tricks up his sleeve!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang Tian nodded and said, “Yes, he’s very impressive. However, we should test him a little more. Send someone to investigate his identity, to ensure that there’s nothing wrong with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly as he enjoyed his meal. He had long ago considered that they would check his identity, so he spent a little more money when forging his documents so that he could eliminate all possible loopholes. Huo Yuhao could practically remain undiscovered even if he was investigated on a national level. He had spent a hundred gold soul coins to fabricate his identity, and had confirmed that everything was alright again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lunchtime was over, and Huo Yuhao led First Bunk’s recruits back to their bunk as a group to rest. Two hours for eating and resting wasn’t considered long, and their afternoon assembly time quickly arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Out of the three hundred recruits, not a single one was late. Evidently, the assigning of fighting soldiers and auxiliary soldiers in the morning left a dark shadow on their hearts. First Bunk’s recruits, with Huo Yuhao leading them, were the first to arrive on the military drill ground. Many recruits were discreetly complaining, and they resented Huo Yuhao for that, but their resentment immediately vanished when they arrived at the military drill ground… because the large team leader, Zhuang Tian, and the other three medium team leaders were already there, standing straight on the drill ground. Zhuang Tian smiled when he saw them arrive, and he even nodded in their direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Encouragement from superiors was clearly quite compelling for these recruits. Their resentment and complaints at being forced to come early disappeared, and everyone stood up straight. Everyone knew the benefits of showing themselves in front of their superiors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao jogged up before Zhuang Tian as he raised his voice and said, “Reporting to you, sir! The recruits from the First Bunk of Team Two, of the Third Battalion, of the Seventh Division, of the Sixth Reserve Legion are all present. Please advise!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang Tian nodded and said, “Very well. Rejoin your lines and place your feet at shoulder-width. This is standing at ease. When I say ‘attention’, you have to close your legs and stand up straight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, sir.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged once and swiftly ran back to his position. His thirty recruits were all standing at ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After almost ten minutes, the recruits from the other bunks arrived, one after another. However, they were clearly not sorted by bunks, and everyone was scattered. But at least nobody was late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Squad, attention!” one of the mid-team leaders shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang Tian surveyed the recruits, who were standing up as straight as they could. He raised his voice and said, “Comrades, we will be brothers-in-arms from now on. Let me introduce these three officers standing beside me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pointed towards the medium team leader who had tested Huo Yuhao’s strength as he spoke and said, “This is Shi Shuo, Medium Team One’s leader.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pointed to the other two and said, “Yun Tian, Medium Team Two’s leader. Long Shun, Medium Team Three’s leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our large team should have a hundred and fifty fighting soldiers, but there are three hundred of you here. Do you know why this is so? This means that after the next three months of basic military training, I have the authority to reduce one hundred and fifty of you to either auxiliary soldiers or send you home. However, I hope that more people can stay behind, and perhaps even the entire lot of you can stay behind, so that we can add one more large team. What happens will all depend on your results after training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A soldier’s sacred duty is to follow orders. The first lesson I want to teach you today is how to follow orders. Shi Shuo, Yun Tian, Long Shun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir!” The three medium team leaders stood up straight as they shouted at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhuang Tian said solemnly, “Everyone will stand at attention from now on. Recruits are allowed to faint, but they cannot slack off, and they cannot relax. We will continue until sunset. Whip those who slack off or relax.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, sir!”</span></p>

The three medium team leaders smiled sardonically before they drew horsewhips from their waists and walked towards the recruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sure everyone heard the large team leader’s words. Stand up straight, everyone. Otherwise, the whip will show no mercy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aren’t we just standing around?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Most recruits didn’t think too much about it. Everyone stood up as straight as they could. Nobody wanted to be whipped!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three medium team leaders’ eyes were tinged with pity towards those recruits whose backs were especially straight. Veterans all knew that they would rather climb mountains and cross rivers than stand at attention! Standing at attention tested one’s willpower the most, but this was the best training for recruits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Walking underneath the sun wasn’t much, but after standing for a long time…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These recruits were all youngsters. They were at least eighteen years old, and none were older than twenty-five. Those who dared to enlist had decent physiques, but after one hour of standing, some recruits were starting to sway and waver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their bodies couldn’t move, and that meant their blood circulation wouldn’t be smooth. In addition to the fact that they were standing up so straight, their muscles began to hurt after a while, and their breathing became a little forced and hindered. Many of their uniforms were soaked with sweat.</span></p>

However, they immediately whipped anyone that wanted to slack off and laze around. They didn’t whip them hard, but every lash still gave those recruits a burning reminder.</span></p>

His eyes were calm, and he wasn’t standing up that straight, but he didn’t relax one bit. He was standing steadily and stably as if he were a statue, while his heart and mind were already immersed in meditation.</span></p>

Standing at attention was painful and torturous to the other recruits, but this was almost considered the best kind of rest for him.</span></p>

He finally had some time to calm himself down. He was satisfied with this, and he even felt as if this was a little luxurious. However, he liked this feeling.</span></p>

That scene had shaken him, and also made him passionate about the military.</span></p>

Wang Xiaodian was amongst those who remained, and several other youths that he had observed before also remained. One youth who wore a grave and stern look on his face even emanated soul power undulations!.
