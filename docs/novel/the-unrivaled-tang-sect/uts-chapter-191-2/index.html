 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No—!” The soul engineers atop the mountain and the soldiers rushing up the mountain all shouted simultaneously. None of them wanted such a perfect goddess to perish like this! Even Zhao Yang’s bear palm slowed slightly. However, he still struck with full force; if he didn’t kill Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, he’d die instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant that the huge bear palm and delicate finger collided, the Goddess of Light’s index finger suddenly turned a strange color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still golden, but it was now somewhat translucent. Her entire right hand seemed to have suddenly become a golden crystal. It was such a beautiful scene that it was even suffocating for those looking at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This crystal-like finger managed to resist the huge bear palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Splat!”</span></p>

Zhao Yang screamed in pain. A hole was formed in the middle of his palm by the crystal finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess of Light brushed her left wing and viciously struck the Violent Goldbear in the waist. He staggered a few steps to the side after he was hit, and a wound that was three feet wide and several inches deep was formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess of Light’s right hand was extremely strong. Her finger contained the soul skill of Wang Dong’s Broken Devil of Light Right Arm Bone! All its power was focused on a single point. After the enhancement of the Raiment of Light, this destructive finger was the strongest strike Wang Dong could muster with his current abilities. Zhao Yang was in deep trouble as he tried to withstand the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Goddess of Light’s wing struck Zhao Yang aside, a cluster of golden light was released from her body, engulfing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something weird occurred. The blood that had spurted out from Zhao Yang’s palm seemed to have frozen, and landed on the ground with a thud. Zhao Yang’s body also turned rigid. There seemed to be a layer of frost covering his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this, the Goddess of Light struck out with her left hand. Her left hand was also golden, but the glow from it was different from the transparent gold that was emitted from her right hand. It resembled golden flares that burned, and these golden flares were icy-cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light fog was the product of Wang Dong’s soul power and Huo Yuhao’s Domain of Perpetual Ice. It fused the power of light and Ultimate Ice. Her left hand was the fusion of Wang Dong’s Golden Light Left Arm Bone and Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress’ Pincer. It seemed to be drifting in the air, but it was the strongest strike of the Goddess of Light after their abilities had improved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tremendous pain caused the Violent Goldbear’s eyes to turn blood-red. He turned around, and his body shone with bright golden light. His sixth soul ring flashed, and a gigantic projection of a giant bear instantly appeared behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This gigantic projection burst forward, and his left arm doubled in size once again. His hair also turned dark-golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Zhao Yang’s strongest offensive soul skill – the Darkgolden Terrorpalm. This palm tapped into the shred of the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s lineage in the Violent Goldbear. As it was used by his Martial Soul True Body, it was also his most destructive skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden flares were already burning. The Goddess of Light’s aura changed again. The Sovereign’s Descent turned her sanctity into superiority, as if she were a queen that overlooked the mortal world. Her entire body turned illusory at this point. Only the golden flares on her left arm still remained as bright and blinding as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this instant, everyone watching this fight was praying in their hearts. They were praying for the goddess in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one hoped that Zhao Yang would win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Splat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as both parties were about to clash, Zhao Yang’s left hand blew apart. The intense pain instantly diminished the might of his Darkgolden Terrorpalm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His right hand had been infused with the aura of Ultimate Ice after it had encountered the Broken Devil of Light. The Domain of Perpetual Ice had also frozen his palm further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed like Zhao Yang had used his Martial Soul True Body to resist the Domain of Perpetual Ice. However, his blood circulation fell by a third of its original rate. His movements seemed to have stalled slightly too. The wound on his right hand was also frozen up to a few inches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anything that was ice could be detonated by the Ice Explosion Technique. Even though the Ice Explosion Technique didn’t mix with Zhao Yang’s soul power, the pain was still tremendous as his palm suddenly blew apart. The impact on him was huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess of Light flew back like a broken kite. Her body was still in the air, but the light shining from her dimmed. As her figure flashed, she was separated back into Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao, and they crashed to the ground. They were both bleeding profusely; they were evidently badly injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pulled Wang Dong in front of him just as they were about to land on the ground, protecting him from the fall. He crashed into the ground heavily, and slid for more than ten meters before he stopped. An intense pain engulfed his entire body. He blacked out immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Violent Goldbear quietly stood where he was. Golden flares slowly but steadily spread across his entire arm before they proliferated to the rest of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When his entire body was covered by golden flares, a flashing golden sun seemed to have appeared at the top of the mountain. This golden sun shone extremely brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone subconsciously shut their eyes. They were at a loss, and didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the golden lights finally dimmed, and everything returned to normal, they realized that the Violent Goldbear had disappeared. Only a patch of ash was left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Radiant Flare, Ultimate Ice, Raiment of Light, Sovereign’s Descent!</span></p>

Zhao Yang’s death also signified that the rebel troops had been defeated. The Sun Moon Empire’s troops killed all the enemy soldiers as they rushed up the mountain. Surrender wasn’t a choice anymore; all of them were mercilessly killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps they were motivated by the Goddess of Light, but the empire’s soldiers on the battlefield were ebullient, as if they had taken stimulants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their commander had briefed them that the Crown Prince’s fiancée was stuck at the top of the mountain before they attacked, and that they were here to save her. They had witnessed the battle between the Goddess of Light and the Violent Goldbear, and finally emerged victorious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not all the soldiers knew who Ju Zi was. They thought that the Goddess of Light was the Crown Prince’s fiancée! Fighting for the Crown Prince’s wife motivated all of them. Even Huo Yuhao didn’t expect that the Raiment of Light would be able to increase the morale of the soldiers so effectively. The figure of the Goddess of Light was deeply imprinted in the heart of every soldier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, Yuhao. How are you?”</span></p>

Huo Yuhao had unleashed the Sovereign’s Descent with all his might in the last strike, sapping all his spiritual power. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao had borne all the impact of the Violent Goldbear’s attack. That was why Wang Dong wasn’t critically injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fresh blood flowed out of Huo Yuhao’s nose. His entire face was very pale, and his breathing was very weak.</span></p>

If not for his impulsiveness, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t have been brought to this battlefield and met such a strong enemy!</span></p>

He lowered his head as he looked at Huo Yuhao’s back. His eyes turned red instantly.</span></p>

The ground was extremely hard, and filled with rocks of uneven sizes.</span></p>

They had no soul power to unleash any soul skills or use any soul tools to protect themselves.</span></p>

The back of his shirt was covered in blood and broken pieces of the soul tool. His entire back had been grazed by the rocks as he slid after crashing to the ground, leaving bloody wounds behind.</span></p>

He didn’t have much soul power left, but he was trying his best to pour his soul power into Huo Yuhao’s body. He was squeezing every drop of soul power he had into Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

She was much calmer than Wang Dong. After all, she had experienced such a situation before. She retrieved a medicinal bottle and shouted to Wang Dong, “Lie him down on your legs. There’s no point in crying. Saving him is the important thing now.”</span></p>

He took in a deep breath and gritted his teeth. He allowed his tears to stream down. He sat on the ground first before laying Huo Yuhao down carefully on his legs.</span></p>

It’ll help stop the bleeding.”</span></p>

Compared to Ju Zi, he was familiar with Huo Yuhao. He knew that Huo Yuhao’s recuperative abilities were very strong. While his injuries were critical, he wasn’t in any real danger. He was unwilling to let someone else treat Huo Yuhao, as he didn’t trust her.</span></p>
