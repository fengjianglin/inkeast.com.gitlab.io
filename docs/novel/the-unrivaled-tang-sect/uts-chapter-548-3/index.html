 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Personally, his aim was to become a member of the God Realm. But what about the Douluo Continent? Would the Sun Moon Empire really conquer everything, and rename it the Sun Moon Continent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, absolutely not! The Douluo Continent will be the Douluo Continent, and I am part of the Douluo Continent. I cannot let that happen no matter what price I have to pay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath as his thoughts stopped there. He gathered his mind once more, and his spiritual power transformed into countless tentacles as they stretched across the ground in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he wasn’t lying here to rest. He was waiting, and he was hoping that the Sun Moon Empire’s main forces would appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Sea City was the Sun Moon Empire’s most important coastal city in the south. Furthermore, this place was very far from Radiant City. Once the Sun Moon Empire’s main forces appeared, the next part of his plan could continue. If his plan was successful in the end, he could see some hope for the Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thing that Huo Yuhao hoped for most was what the Body Douluo had sacrificed himself to achieve, and that was to kill Xu Tianran!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was a ruthless and ambitious character, and Huo Yuhao still felt a little fearful towards him. He didn’t know why he felt like that, but he was certain that the Sun Moon Empire would fall into disarray if he died. The Douluo Continent could at least catch their breath if that happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Ju Zi, even though she was formidable commander, Huo Yuhao never treated her like an enemy in his heart for some reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was aware of this problem. He knew that the reason why he couldn’t become a commander of an army like Ju Zi was because his heart was too soft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Huo Yuhao was still contemplating as he released his spiritual power, but a strange feeling suddenly appeared in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sensation was very unique. He realized to his shock that there were countless faint spiritual undulations within his Spiritual Detection’s range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were fearful and afraid. They were trying to dodge away, but couldn’t run away at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every spiritual undulation was extremely fine and delicate, and a single thought from Huo Yuhao could destroy them. But this was the first time Huo Yuhao had felt so many instances of his spiritual power at the same time. This was his first experience after his spiritual power had completely entered a very detailed and intricate level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These faint spiritual tentacles didn’t come from his enemies, or from a formidable individual. They came from the plants that were growing in the earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These plants ranged from a small blade of Bluesilver Grass to a large tree that was several dozen meters tall. Every plant possessed its own spiritual power. Some were strong, while others were weak, but they were mostly weak and frail. They were evidently feeling frightened because they could feel Huo Yuhao’s powerful spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That feeling was just too strange. Huo Yuhao discovered for the first time that plants had spiritual power; even the small Bluesilver Grass was no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That feeling was just too magical. Huo Yuhao subconsciously expressed his friendliness, while he made his spiritual power gentler as he stretched it out even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His friendliness was instantly returned. Those frightened and fearful spiritual tentacles immediately stopped trembling, and conveyed excited and happy thoughts to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their thoughts and minds were so simple. But Huo Yuhao’s heart was still filled with happiness and satisfaction in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single spiritual tentacle didn’t count for anything, but when thousands and millions of spiritual tentacles were conveying their happiness, how could you not be happy? Huo Yuhao was like that, and so he was happy and elated that the friendliness he had released was immediately returned. Furthermore, those strange spiritual tentacles were fusing with his spiritual power, to the point where his Spiritual Detection could vividly sense the intricate changes that were happening to these plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That sensation was extremely strange and unique, like Huo Yuhao had become the leader of all the plants within five kilometers around him, and his minions and subordinates were reporting their feelings to him. The plants’ spiritual tentacles amplified him, and Huo Yuhao was consuming less and less spiritual power from using Spiritual Detection. Furthermore, the more spiritual tentacles that returned his friendliness there were, the less spiritual power he consumed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s so magical. Spiritual power can actually be used this way.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao finally understood how, during his previous encounter, so many aquatic soul beasts could be linked together. That was especially so for the merfolk’s martial soul combination skills. The reason why they could complete their martial soul combination skill probably wasn’t because their blood and descent were very similar, but because their spiritual power was extremely well-connected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao seemed to have grasped some of the spiritual world’s profundities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He no longer held back as he pushed his Spiritual Detection outward as much as he could, and the benevolence in his heart increased continuously. He felt the feedback that those plants were giving him, and he expressed his love for them at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was unwittingly extended very far, and his spiritual power gradually reached its limit. But Huo Yuhao was completely stunned at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he was astonished. He realized to his intense shock that his spiritual power’s range could reach more than fifty thousand meters in diameter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection normally had a limit of twenty thousand meters! That was already a stunning figure, but that figure now stood at fifty thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this diameter was calculated with his body at the center, and it couldn’t be used in a single direction, he had already surpassed everything in history, and created another miracle. Huo Yuhao believed that not even Ultimate Douluo could stretch their spiritual power across fifty kilometers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A diameter of fifty thousand meters meant a diameter of fifty kilometers. What an extraordinarily vast area of effect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only was Heavenly Sea City within his senses, but several other cities were also within range of his senses as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, his Spiritual Detection worked differently this time. It didn’t project everything into his mind three-dimensionally. After reaching fifty thousand kilometers, everything in Huo Yuhao’s vision came from the plants that were cooperating with him. He was viewing the world through their feelings and vision. But that was already sufficient! Even though Spiritual Detection like that wasn’t as complete as his three-dimensional Spiritual Detection was, conducting investigations through those plants’ spiritual undulations was a lot more discreet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of spiritual detectors would conduct investigations against a plant’s spiritual power? A plant’s spiritual power was too weak, it was entirely negligible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had unwittingly discovered such a mystical ability. How could he not be happy? Furthermore, he could obtain some simple information from these plants. Even though that information wasn’t much, it was direct and easy to understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao relaxed as he felt his spiritual power extend outwards. He was like the king of all the plants within his Spiritual Detection, and all the plants around him were reporting their thoughts and feelings to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A plant’s thoughts were very simple. If you expressed your benevolence to them, they would express their friendliness to you. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was extremely strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some plant-type soul beasts within his Spiritual Detection, but most plant-type soul beasts were extremely weak. Their subordination to Huo Yuhao was even more complete, because they could sense exactly how formidable his spiritual power was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a thought occurred to Huo Yuhao. He asked a question with his Spiritual Detection, and used his consciousness to reach all the plants within his spiritual power’s range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Huo Yuhao didn’t expect was, after several minutes, a single consciousness that was responding to him appeared in his mind. He was so excited that he jumped to his feet from the thicket he was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The question he had asked those plants was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Have you seen the Bluesilver Emperor? The king of the Bluesilver Grass?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Plants understood each other best, and Huo Yuhao only had a tiny shred of hope that his question would be answered. But he received a very definite reply after a few short minutes! Yes, he received a definite reply!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s body was still very weak and frail. Even though ingesting the Qiankun Fortune Pill meant she was no longer deteriorating towards death, her abilities were completely gone. She even needed to lean on something for support when she walked. How could Huo Yuhao be willing to see her like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never expected that the Bluesilver Emperor, which he had tried so hard to find within the Douluo Continent’s three native empires to no avail, would be discovered in the Sun Moon Empire. This was truly an unexpected surprise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao regulated his breathing and tried his best to stabilize his emotions. Afterwards, he expressed benevolence towards that spiritual undulation that was giving him a definite reply, and concentrated his Spiritual Detection in that direction to search for the living being that was answering him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very calm. He knew that he had to be very careful. He knew from how sensitive the plants’ spiritual tentacles were that if overly eager emotions appeared in his spiritual undulations, he could very easily be removed from his current state. Establishing a connection once more would probably be extremely difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentle spiritual undulations that were filled with friendliness travelled soundlessly towards that living being that was giving him a definite reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly discovered that plant, which had conspicuously stronger spiritual undulations that typical plants. When his spiritual power locked onto it, he realized to his surprise that it was a datura flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This flower was no longer just a flower. It was a soul beast, and its cultivation rank was close to a ten year soul beast. Its intelligence was just starting to open up, and there was a single thread of it.
