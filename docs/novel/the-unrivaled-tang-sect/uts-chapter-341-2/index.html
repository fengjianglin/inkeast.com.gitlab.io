 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scorpion Tiger Douluo, Zhang Peng, was among them, along with about a dozen other shadows. The Sun Moon Empire’s mysterious Imperial Tutor stuck close to Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an unspoken rule in the world of soul masters – Titled Douluo who interfered or participated in worldly affairs or conflicts had to fight it out in the sky to avoid annihilation, destruction, and the loss of life. Only the victorious party was worthy of making a move against others who weren’t Titled Douluo. As long as there was one Titled Douluo who hadn’t been defeated, the other side’s Titled Douluo couldn’t participate in combat against others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This rule was a commandment left behind ten thousand years ago by the Tang Sect’s founding father after he entered the Divine Realm. Not a single empire had passed this as a law, but all the Titled Douluo in the world followed this commandment religiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">War was most harmful towards normal citizens, while it wasn’t difficult for individuals like Titled Douluo to massacre an entire city if they unleashed their full strength. This commandment greatly reduced the bloodshed and lives lost in the wars that had unfurled in the ten thousand years since. This was reason why Long Xiaoyao brought it up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was an Ultimate Douluo, and the Body Sect’s sect leader, Du Busi, wouldn’t break that rule. Nobody knew exactly how effective Tang San’s commandment had been ten thousand years down the road, but everyone was clear that one of them breaking the commandment meant the other party would do so as well. If that happened, the entire Continent would swiftly become devoid of life. This was the reason why the Titled Douluo fought in the sky no matter their goal, and those who didn’t have nine soul rings were responsible for assaulting the royal palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A golden beam of light lit up half the night sky as the Taotie Douluo, Elder Xuan, appeared in the sky. He seemed to chime in from the other end as they sandwiched Long Xiaoyao between them, and the three of them soared into the sky at the same time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were more than twenty individuals who rose together with Elder Xuan and Du Busi into the sky. Long Xiaoyao was a powerful being, but his expression changed – his side had only half the number of Titled Douluo compared to the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Long Xiaoyao was very clear that with the Body Sect and the Shrek Academy’s depth and background, more than half of these Titled Douluo were Transcendent Douluo. Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare to trespass into Radiant City’s royal palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xuan Zi, we don’t have to be polite with the old darkness dragon anymore. He’s our senior – let’s team up against him.” Du Busi laughed heartily, and he bolted out right when he rose into the sky as he went straight for Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan frowned, but he hesitated for only a moment before he flew towards Long Xiaoyao along with Du Busi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them were some of the strongest individuals in the world; they were both Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo. However, it might seem like they were only one rank away from a Rank 99 Ultimate Douluo, but they were very clear what this gap meant. This was the reason why Du Busi hadn’t dared to attack Mu En when he faced him those years ago, even though he knew that Elder Mu was still recovering from his old injuries. If they matched up one-versus-one against the Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao, they had no chance at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But two against one was different. They were at the pinnacle of the world, and Long Xiaoyao might not be able to defeat them one against two even with his strength. This wasn’t as simple as one plus two – their cultivation and experience over a hundred years would allow them to complement each other and raise their overall strength exponentially.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other Titled Douluo didn’t make a move. Instead, they retreated far away and watched this epic showdown. This was a great opportunity for them to watch a battle at this level, and it would be very beneficial for people at their level. If they could understand something, or have some kind of revelation from this fight, that would be very catalyzing and inspirational for their cultivation in the future. Ranking up after becoming a Titled Douluo was extremely challenging, and this was especially so for those Titled Douluo who were stuck at the bottleneck that would make them into a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao wasn’t fearful at all as the two powerful individuals lunged towards him. He raised both hands in the air and pushed one out against Du Busi, and the other at Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deep dragon roars echoed through the night sky like rolling thunder. In Elder Xuan and Du Busi’s eyes, Long Xiaoyao was like an ancient dragon arching its back and flashing its sharp claws at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two black palm shadows swelled in the wind, quickly reaching a height of one hundred meters. They were so tall and majestic that they resembled small mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh!” Du Busi growled as green light surged around his body. A dark green light stretched out behind his back, and his arms grew exponentially as he pushed forward with his two Giant Spirit’s Palms and collided with one of the black palm shadows in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” A deep boom resonated across the air, and even Radiant City’s royal palace trembled beneath it. Du Busi quivered, but his enormous dark green hands plunged into the large black palm shadow, and he forcefully tore it apart right in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Elder Xuan’s response was a lot less ferocious. He took a step forward through the air, and the Godly Taotie Bull’s projection flickered behind him as two long horns protruded from the top of his head. Two yellow, two purple, four black, and one red soul ring shimmered into view as he punched out with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black palm shadow dissipated, while Elder Xuan was sent hurtling backwards more than ten meters. Long Xiaoyao’s shoulders trembled in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Emperor Douluo was fighting against two, and he still had the upper hand – this was true strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom, boom, boom!” Deep thunderous booms resonated in the sky, and shadows flickered incessantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s begun. We should make a move.” A bright voice rang out in a dark alley beside the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange sight occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a small being hovering in front of Wang Dong’er, Wang Qiu’er, Ji Juechen, Jing Ziyan, and Xiao Xiao. This being was about one foot tall, but it felt like a real person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Judging by its appearance, wasn’t that Huo Yuhao? The light coming from his body wasn’t glaring, and his projection almost felt material. However, he was no longer crippled and immobile, and he was just drifting in front of everyone. He looked a lot like his Spirit, the little Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was overcome with shock when Huo Yuhao appeared in front of them like that a couple of minutes ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, this was Huo Yuhao’s spiritual avatar that he had separated from his main body. He was gradually able to control it as he flew along, and even though he was still a little disoriented and unfamiliar because he had to split his consciousness in two, the fact that he could fly his spiritual avatar to his companions proved that he had been successful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t hasty to lead his companions into the operation when he arrived. Instead, he was waiting quietly until now. He flew over to Wang Dong’er and sat down on her shoulder when they heard the deep and deafening booms in the sky, and he urged them to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er glanced at him, and she couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re quite cute in this form.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rolled his eyes and said, “Let’s go, we should hurry. Almost all the powerful individuals are concentrated over there, and it seems like the Sun Moon Empire is prepared for this ambush on the royal palace. If I’m not wrong, the Class 9 soul engineers who are normally stationed here have been drawn over there. We have about an hour to figure out how much of an advantage we can take from this opportunity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Wang Dong’er acknowledged, and she walked at the forefront with Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power guiding her. The other four followed closely behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was walking right behind Wang Dong’er, and she stared at Huo Yuhao on Wang Dong’er’s shoulder. Strange lights flickered time and time again in her eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow is getting more and more powerful, indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The place they were at was the same one that Chen An had met somebody in secret that day, and the same place that Huo Yuhao had discreetly discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had used spiritual separation that time, as well. But his main body wasn’t doing anything when he had used it back then, while his spiritual avatar didn’t have to use any abilities at all. This meant the previous instance was a lot easier to control and operate, but now he had to concentrate all his energy on this endeavor. Huo Yuhao activated his Imitation, and he integrated himself and his five companions into their surroundings. Nobody could discover them even if someone came close to check.</span></p>

They quickly arrived outside the same courtyard where Chen An had discreetly met up with somebody back then.</span></p>

He increased his Spiritual Detection’s area of effect at the same time, and encompassed the entire courtyard.</span></p>

The only person who remained was the middle-aged man who met Chen An that day, and his surname was Li. At this moment, he was just standing inside the courtyard, a calm expression on his face. However, anxiety flashed across his eyes from time to time, as if he was waiting for something.</span></p>

He was waiting for news that the deal had been successful.</span></p>

He had to be as cautious and careful as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a black metal box in his hands, and he glanced again and again at the crystal screen on the metal box’s surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me go,” Wang Qiu’er whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hurriedly waved her away and said, “We’re not in a hurry. Let’s wait for a little while more. This place seems lax on the outside, but it’s very strict and secure on the inside, and there are many traps all around. We cannot act rashly and alert the enemy – he’s waiting for news, and we’ll make our move when he gets it. This way, the person he’s meeting up with won’t suspect that something isn’t right, and we can avoid any unnecessary accidents.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s calm and composure influenced everybody around him, and Wang Qiu’er said nothing more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The deep booms that were coming from the distant sky that resembled rolling thunder became louder and louder. Dark green, black, and yellow colors alternately lit up the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were battling high up in the sky, but everyone could still feel how epic and magnificent that battle was even though they were so far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A look of pity and regret flashed across Huo Yuhao’s eyes. He would really have loved to watch this clash between this generation’s most powerful individuals if he hadn’t had more important things to do.</span></p>
