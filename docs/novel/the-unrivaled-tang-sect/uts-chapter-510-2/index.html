 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was daybreak, and the light of the morning sun stretched gradually from beyond the horizon as a gorgeous and transparent beam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It carried the gentle morning dew as it shone upon a beautiful couple in the Sparring Arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gradually opened his eyes as purple light could be faintly seen from the bottom of his eyes, and he absorbed the purple energy that came from the white sun in the east. His entire being’s aura seemed to be awakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lowered his head and stared at Tang Wutong, who was still sleeping soundly on his lap, and his eyes became incredibly tender.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, they slept for the entire night in this place. They didn’t confess anything more, and they just had each other’s warm embraces as they felt each other’s heartbeats and love. They slowly fell into slumber as they immersed themselves in that intoxicating sensation. The shadows in their hearts seemed to have been dispelled after this night, and as Huo Yuhao opened his eyes and saw the light coming from the horizon, all he felt was that his fatigue from the recent months was gone. His mind felt even more liberated than his body did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gently caressed Tang Wutong’s long hair, and he realized that his feelings towards her seemed to have changed compared to a long time ago. There was more treasuring besides love, and there was nothing more joyous for him than for Dong’er to return to his side. Just like he had told her last night, he wouldn’t let her leave his side ever again, no matter what. He would protect her for his entire life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was wondering where you two were. You’re actually all the way out here. Did you sleep here last night?” A voice suddenly rang out in this moment, and Huo Yuhao was awakened from his thoughts. He turned around, and saw his eldest senior sister, Zhang Lexuan, walking up from beneath them with an amused look on her face. She quickly arrived next to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong woke up. She had slept lying down, and used Huo Yuhao’s thigh as her pillow. She was sleeping very comfortably as she opened her blurry eyes and saw Zhang Lexuan. She hurriedly sat up as she lowered her head. She blushed as she said softly, “Eldest senior sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan grinned and said, “The two of you have been reunited after all, and I didn’t waste my efforts this time. Seems like the two of you have settled everything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at Zhang Lexuan in shock. “Eldest senior sister, so you already knew…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan laughed. “Of course. Otherwise, why do you think I’d help her? Why would I arrange everything like that? Would I let the two of you confess to each other in private? But I wasn’t very confident when the event was halfway through, because I didn’t know how Tang Wutong would convince you, stubborn donkey. Seems like she did have a solution after all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao scratched his head. What had happened last night was no longer important for him. What was important was that he had managed to find Dong’er once more. Rather, he managed to find Tang Wutong again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eldest senior sister, why are you looking for me so early in the morning?” Huo Yuhao was a little displeased about Zhang Lexuan interrupting their warm and peaceful time together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan rolled her eyes and said ,”Yuhao, have you become forgetful? You must have forgotten about real business because you have Wutong. Do you still want to graduate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? Yes, I…” Huo Yuhao really did forget that he had his graduation assessment today! Furthermore, Teacher Wang Yan had told him that his graduation test would be difficult yesterday. He was still thinking about the assessment when he was participating in the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date, and he was supposed to prepare for the test after going through the motions for the event. But Tang Wutong had recovered Dong’er’s memories, and their Haodong power had fused once more, and that made him forget about his test completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only now when Zhang Lexuan brought it up did Huo Yuhao remember that he had such an important thing to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You did forget, didn’t you! Are you still taking the test? Let me tell you, if you don’t take this test, you’ll have to wait for at least three years before you can have another chance. Hurry up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, okay. Wutong, come with me.” Huo Yuhao turned around and grasped Tang Wutong’s hands as he spoke. They were finally reunited, and he wouldn’t let her leave his side, no matter when and what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Tang Wutong nodded in acknowledgement, there was some amusement in her eyes as she stared at him. She could feel his nervousness towards her, and she was very happy about that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The test naturally wouldn’t happen so early in the morning. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong went to eat something before they arrived outside the Sea God’s Pavilion together. Zhang Lexuan told him that the test would begin here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their surroundings were very tranquil and peaceful when they arrived in front of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Nobody else was around, and Huo Yuhao led Tang Wutong as he knelt down in front of the Golden Tree and kowtowed respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know, teacher? I’ve finally found Dong’er again, and she’s called Tang Wutong now. Her illness has been treated, and we are finally back together again. I will never let her go again, and I will always be beside her to protect and love her. I will take her as my wife, and you must come if you can on the day that we get married! You are my closest family, and we would be especially happy if you could give us your blessings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden light seemed to flicker on the Golden Tree, as if the Dragon God Douluo Mu En was answering them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re still young, and you’re thinking about marrying? Weren’t you always so depressed and lifeless before this?” Elder Xuan’s teasing voice could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong stood up, but they were a little dazed as they turned around, because the formation that they could see was a little too large.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elders of the Sea God’s Pavilion streamed out from the Sea God’s Pavilion under Elder Xuan’s lead. Elder Xuan walked at the forefront, while Elder Song and Elder Zhuang followed behind him. The other elders were behind them, along with the Martial Soul Department’s Dean, Yan Shaozhe, the department’s vice-Dean, Cai Mei’er, the Soul Tool Department’s Dean, Xian Lin’er, and its vice-Dean, Qian Duoduo. Their eldest senior sister Zhang Lexuan, Bei Bei, Teacher Wang Yan, and Han Ruoruo followed at the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost every single person from Shrek Academy’s upper echelons had arrived.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Am I not the only one taking the graduation test today?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thought surfaced in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, Elder Xuan, elders.” Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong hurriedly came forward to greet them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan could see that they were holding hands, and he couldn’t help but laugh as he said, “Are you satisfied now? Let me tell you, if you want to leave Shrek City again, you may, but Wutong has to stay. You can go wherever you want, and we won’t restrict you at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately said without hesitation, “No, I’m not going anywhere. I will be wherever Wutong is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha!” Huo Yuhao’s attitude caused all the elders to laugh out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song couldn’t help but smile and shake her head. “Youngsters! Youngsters after all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao scratched his head embarrassingly. What he said was instinctive, and just came out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong blushed even more, but she had no intention to withdraw her hand from Huo Yuhao’s grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “Alright, let’s talk about legitimate business. I’ve heard from Lexuan that you’re planning to pass the test and conclude your studies in the academy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little speechless.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Do you not know what I want? My graduation test has already brought out the various elders. What are they trying to do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes! I have been studying in the academy for many years, and I wish to pass the test so that I can officially become a graduate from the inner courtyard.” He had other thoughts on his mind, but he was still very honest and politically correct on the surface. It seemed like this formation would be quite a challenge to overcome, so it was better to be a little more honest and sincere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded and said, “Good! That counts as an accomplishment in your studies, and that’s a very glorious thing for students. Because of your especially outstanding performance, everyone will observe today’s graduation test. Lexuan! You will be the main supervisor. Tell him what today’s test will be about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Zhang Lexuan acknowledged as she stepped out and stared at Huo Yuhao amusingly. But for some reason, Huo Yuhao could feel that her smile wasn’t a friendly one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The original plan was to give you seven tasks, but after my report to the Sea God’s Pavilion’s Elders, they have decided that because of your contributions to the academy, and because you’re also part of the Sea God’s Pavilion, we will condense seven tasks into three.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s head swelled when he heard that there were seven.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven condensed into three seems pretty good. But these three tasks will probably very difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, Zhang Lexuan’s subsequent words made Huo Yuhao react with utter shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan said, “First, because you’ve accepted teachings from both the Martial Soul Department and the Soul Tool Department, both departments will give you an assignment to accomplish separately. These constitute the first two assignments, and they have been given by Dean Yan and Dean Xian respectively. Dean Xian’s assignment for you is for you to forge a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell for the academy, and Dean Yan’s assignment is for you to defeat him in battle…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao stared at Zhang Lexuan with wide eyes and open jaws, like he was witnessing the descent of God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is the graduation test? What kind of test is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His first assignment was to craft a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell, and his second assignment was to defeat Dean Yan. Dean Yan was a Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo who possessed the Radiant Phoenix as his martial soul! What kind of joke was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan pretended she didn’t hear Huo Yuhao’s exclamation as she continued, “As for your third assignment, it’s intended to test your integrated abilities. The academy will give you a third assignment once you complete the first two, and the academy will let you graduate once you complete that one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was completely speechless at this point. He glanced at Zhang Lexuan, and then at Elder Xuan beside her. He laughed bitterly and said, “Elder Xuan, do you think we can do it this way? I’ll just remain a student at the academy, and I’m not going to graduate. Is that okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said amusingly, “Yes, of course you may. The academy will be proud to always have a student like you. But I have to remind you of one thing! Huo Yuhao, the academy has a very explicit rule that students are not allowed to have intimate relationships with teachers. Tang Wutong is now an assistant teacher for the academy. Therefore, there is a problem with the status between the two of you. You can continue being a student, but you won’t be able to have this relationship with Teacher Tang in the future. Do as you wish.”</span></p>
