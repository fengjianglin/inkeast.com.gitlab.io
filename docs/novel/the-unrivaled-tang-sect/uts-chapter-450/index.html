That was the reason why his thoughts were a little different when he was escorting Huo Yuhao into the air. From the White Tiger Duke’s perspective, Huo Yuhao was likely to be a disciple of the person who had saved him. Perhap, the person who had saved him came from Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Waiting was a kind of torture. Xu Sanshi and the others had already been waiting for a long time. There was a dark door not far from them – Huo Yuhao had told them that if they didn’t hear his call within two hours, then they had to charge out from this door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Almost an hour had passed, but they still hadn’t received any news at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sanshi, do you think Yuhao is in trouble? Why do I feel like something is not right with this place of his?” Jiang Nannan whispered to Xu Sanshi, who was beside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was momentarily stunned. “What’s wrong? Since Yuhao has allowed us to participate in this operation, there shouldn’t be a problem. Look – we have more than ten Titled Douluo with us, and we have to rely on their strength to complete our mission! Yuhao can’t have lied to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan forced a laugh and said, “The reason I think something is wrong is because of these Titled Douluo! Think about it – what will happen if this operation fails? Won’t everyone be completely stuck in this place without his call? That can’t be the case, because he’s left this dark door for us. But where does this door lead? If his mission has failed, he can’t possibly let these Titled Douluo rush out into our enemies’ cannon fire. I’m afraid that this door leads us directly back into our camp!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was rendered speechless for a while as he listened to Jiang Nannan’s words. His facial expression gradually turned black after a few moments as he snapped around at Jiang Nannan and growled, “Why didn’t you say this earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan looked very aggrieved. “It only just came to me. It seems like Yuhao isn’t confident at all! We have all been tricked. No wonder I felt as if something wasn’t right when he agreed so readily. What should we do now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi rubbed his fists and said, “We have to wait – that’s the only thing we can do. If this door leads back to our camp, then walking out now will mean we no longer have an opportunity to help him. We can only pray that his mission is a success. That little rascal is putting himself in danger once again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

The White Tiger Duke was sitting in the main commander’s seat, and Princess Jiujiu was sitting beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were all waiting quietly for news to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a dark door conjured not far from the White Tiger Duke. Huo Yuhao had left this behind before he left. He told the White Tiger Duke that even if his mission wasn’t successful, he wouldn’t incur any losses for the army at all, and going through with their conservative plan was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke was clear that Huo Yuhao no longer cared about his safety when he said those words, and when those Titled Douluo walked out from this door, it would mean that Huo Yuhao had paid with his life in this operation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul master legions would complete the rest of their offensive, and all eight soul master legions were ready. All they were waiting for was the signal from the frontlines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu tried her best to remain calm, and she sat beside the White Tiger Duke in silence. However, everyone could feel the stifling pressure in the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke and Princess Jiujiu undoubtedly felt the greatest pressure, because they were the only ones who knew about the news that came from the Heavenly Soul Empire. If their mission was unsuccessful, then the Star Luo Empire would be pushed into a completely passive position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All they could do was pray for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Yueheng and Dai Luoli were both standing behind the White Tiger Duke. Dai Yueheng’s eyebrows were slightly furrowed, as if he were thinking about something, while Dai Luoli’s eyes were flickering faintly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke and Princess Jiujiu knew about the secret news that came from the Heavenly Soul Empire, and he knew yet another secret – he knew the secret of Huo Yuhao’s identity. Huo Yuhao had gone to look for him this morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you here, brother? Are you here to give me some pointers?” Dai Luoli stared at Huo Yuhao, who had lifted his tent’s curtain and was walking in, and he couldn’t help but greet him excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head with a faint smile on his face and said, “Eh? You want to be beaten up again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli blushed and said, “Being beaten up isn’t a bad thing, actually. My improvements were the fastest when you were beating me up. Brother, you have to promise me to get me one of those Spirits. We can do that once this war is over. Even though I have been bottlenecked at Rank 40 because I lack an extra soul ring, I can feel that I have been improving very quickly recently.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “That’s good. Don’t worry, Spirits won’t be a problem as long as you’re willing to put in effort. Right, I came here to find you because there’s something I have to tell you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Dai Luoli asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “I am going on a mission tonight, and I may not return. I haven’t decided yet – if I don’t return, then you can tell him about my secrets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh? What mission are you going to execute? Will it be dangerous? Who and what do you want me to tell?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao walked in front of Dai Luoli and rubbed his head gently. “It’s not dangerous. What I meant was that you can tell your father about my identity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli trembled. “You’ve figured it out?”</span></p>

I just don’t want to face him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But if you leave, then when will we meet again?” Dai Luoli said hurriedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned. “We’ll meet again if fate allows it.”</span></p>

He felt, in that moment, as if there were countless avenging spirits that were about to tear his body apart, and were about to swallow his spirit.</span></p>

At most, it is comparatively a little stronger, and its power is similar to the Starsky Douluo Ye Yulin’s Sunmoon Divine Needle. However, the Death God contains another frightening power, and this power is the key – and that is the power of avenging spirits.”</span></p>

This was the result of my spiritual power being suppressed. The spiritual power that suppressed me is both tremendous and terrifying, and it is charged with vigorous destructiveness, along with deep resentment. If I’m not wrong, this power comes from avenging spirits, and these avenging spirits are being compressed by some unknown force into something frightening – called the force of vengeance – before it’s fused with the Death God’s own high-temperature, high-pressure soul power. This is how the Light of the Death God is formed.”</span></p>
