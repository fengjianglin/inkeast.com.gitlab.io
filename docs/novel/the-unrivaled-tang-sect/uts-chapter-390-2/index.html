This kid is bound to achieve lots of success in the future if he can overcome this psychological barrier. He’ll definitely be a leading figure that can terrorize the entire continent. Perhaps these ordeals are the best whetstones to shape him into a great character.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rims of Nan Qiuqiu’s eyes turned a bit red, and she said, “It’s just that this is too cruel. The person he loves is unconscious, and the person who loves him died for him. If I were him, I would have already broken down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui hugged her daughter and said, “This is why you’re not him. You’ll never reach the heights that he’ll reach in the future. I just hope that you’ll do your best to chase after him as you remain by his side. After some time, you’ll discover that you’ve widened the gap between you and others of the same age, even though you find yourself lagging further and further behind him. Just like I said to him, you must always look forward.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Nan Qiuqiu seemed to understand something, and snuggled beside her mother. However, her mind kept on returning the teary look in Huo Yuhao’s eyes before he left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he unleashed his soul power, Huo Yuhao’s speed was lightning-quick. A formless protective barrier that was formed using his spiritual power helped to resist the strong winds coming from the outside world. No matter whether one used their naked eyes or any type of surveillance soul tool, they wouldn’t be able to discover his presence in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Wang Qiu’er’s words before she died kept on playing in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>

The sixth soul ring of Wang Qiu’er’s Eye of Destiny couldn’t be appraised using its ‘limit’, while the Skull of Destiny was an astonishing soul bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he completed his perfect fusion with these strengths that Wang Qiu’er left behind, he was enhanced until he reached another level entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This should be an extremely happy thing to any soul master. However, could Huo Yuhao really be happy?</span></p>

When Wang Qiu’er sacrificed herself for him, he could clearly feel Wang Qiu’er’s apology towards Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The more it was like this, the more tormented he felt internally.</span></p>

I couldn’t forget about you.”</span></p>

This time, Dong’er isn’t by your side, and we aren’t in the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley. This time, I will not lose to her anymore – &nbsp;she is in a deep sleep, so there’s no way she can compete with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I like how you are now, because you won’t resist, and just take everything in silence. How I wish I could spend eternity with you like this! Thank you, Yuhao, because you have finally told me that there is space for me in your heart. In the end, I didn’t waste my experience of that love that humans have. Perhaps I have become more like a human at this point.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Yuhao. Perhaps this is the best outcome for us – no matter what, we will</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">never be separated again.” &nbsp;</span></p>

I’ve fused with everything from you. We’ll really never be separated again.</span></p>

His immense spiritual power gave him an extraordinary memory. This was why he could clearly recall the entire process of Wang Qiu’er’s sacrifice for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er used the most extreme method to finally be together with him. It could even be said that she had forced him to be together with her. The sorrow he felt in his heart would never disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qiu’er, don’t worry. I’ll continue to live strongly for you and for Dong’er. You are already a part of my body. By continuing to live strongly, it’s the same as you being together with me. I’ll protect everything that you’ve given me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished muttering these words, he gradually retracted the sadness in his eyes. Yes, he had to be strong! It was only by doing so that he wouldn’t let down everything that Wang Qiu’er had done for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao only wanted to do one thing right now from the depths of his heart. He wanted to go to the Clear Sky Sect to see Wang Dong’er. He had already lost Wang Qiu’er, and he really wanted to be by Wang Dong’er’s side and protect her. He wanted to stay with her until she woke up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he couldn’t do so. At least not now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because he had something more important to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recalled what Wang Qiu’er had said to him at the final moments before she died. As the Emperor Beast and god beast of Destiny, Wang Qiu’er had offered herself to save Huo Yuhao. This greatly affected the entire Great Star Dou Forest. There was bound to be some kind of reaction, and it might even catalyze a disaster. He needed to rush back to the forest. It was only by inheriting Wang Qiu’er’s power of destiny that he could settle the core of this issue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why Huo Yuhao didn’t choose to return to Shrek City with Nan Qiuqiu and Nan Shuishui immediately was because he knew that he wasn’t strong enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though his spiritual power had been greatly enhanced, he still wasn’t strong enough. He wanted to become even stronger. This process wouldn’t take too much time either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to proceed towards a place which wasn’t too far from where he had absorbed Wang Qiu’er’s Sacrifice. It was a place in the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao flew, he called, “Brother Skydream.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of dim gold light flashed, and a figure appeared beside him. It was a handsome man with short white hair, curly eyebrows, and golden eyes. There were even golden halos around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao.” The eyes of this youth looked a little lost, but they were also filled with comfort and gentleness. Yes, this was the human form of the Skydream Iceworm. When Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power transformed from the concrete-immaterial realm to the concrete-material realm, the Skydream Iceworm, Ice Empress and little Snow Lady’s Spirit had all evolved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their spiritual bodies were in Huo Yuhao’s body. As Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea evolved, their abilities, or rather the strengths that they had been suppressing for fear of overloading Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea, were all released. This was also the reason why the Skydream Iceworm could adopt a human form and use his spiritual power as a foundation to materialize his form next to Huo Yuhao. At this moment, the ring on Huo Yuhao’s finger that was formed using the Skydream Iceworm’s spirit had already disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Brother Skydream, I’m fine. How far are we?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm replied, “We should be going in the correct direction. That fellow lives in a forbidden region of the Sun Moon Empire known as the Evildemon Forest. Although it isn’t as huge as the Great Star Dou Forest, it’s still the largest forest within the borders of the Sun Moon Empire. It’s located roughly to the west of the Jing Yang Mountain Range that you’ve been to before. There shouldn’t be any problem as long as you continue flying in that direction. With your current speed, you’ll be able to see it in at most two hours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Thanks, Brother Skydream.” Huo Yuhao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm sighed and said, “Do you still have to stand on ceremony with me? Yuhao, do your best. All of us believe that you are the best. You were right earlier. It’s best to not let Qiu’er down by living well. To a certain extent, Qiu’er didn’t die. She’s only spending the rest of her life with you. You are her, and she’s you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I understand. I’ll tough it out.” Huo Yuhao nodded at the Skydream Iceworm again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm gave him a comforting look before turning into a streak of golden light and fusing into his body.</span></p>

There was an extremely strong soul beast species in that forest – the Evileye Tyrants! Their leader was the Evileye Tyrant King, who was also known as the Evil Emperor.</span></p>

Evileye Tyrants were extremely strong spiritual-type soul beasts. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power wasn’t strong enough in the past, but he was qualified now, as his spiritual power had been enhanced.</span></p>

However, he still needed to go to the Evildemon Forest. That was because his soul power wasn’t at Rank 60, but Rank 70!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished fusing with the origin energy of Ultimate Ice earlier, his soul power had already crossed Rank 60. Even he himself didn’t know what rank his soul power was at. When he absorbed Wang Qiu’er’s soul ring and soul bone, his Spirit Eyes fused perfectly with everything from Wang Qiu’er, as she had offered herself as a sacrifice for him. The immense power of destiny that the Emperor Beast possessed greatly enhanced his soul power. As a result, he immediately discovered that his soul power had reached another bottleneck again – the Rank 70 bottleneck.</span></p>

He could only cultivate silently as he watched his teammates break through to become Soul Emperors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the origin energy of Ultimate Ice that the Snow Empress’ Spirit put in him, and his perfect fusion with Wang Qiu’er, things finally paid off for him. As long as he obtained his seventh soul ring, he could finally make the jump from the mid-tier to the threshold of the top tier and become a Soul Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was actually very impatient right now. He wanted to return to Shrek quickly. That was because he clearly recalled that Wang Qiu’er had mentioned that the Great Star Dou Forest would react harshly to her death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether he returned as a Soul Emperor or a Soul Sage wasn’t just a concept. He knew that only he was capable of settling this issue. His abilities would carry an important weight in what was to come. That was why he quickly thought of what he had to do. After weighing the pros and cons, he decided to proceed towards the Evildemon Forest, which was nearby, to obtain his seventh soul ring before returning to Shrek.</span></p>
