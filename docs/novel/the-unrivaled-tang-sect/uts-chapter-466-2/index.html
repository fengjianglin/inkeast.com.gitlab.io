 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “The formation of any Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern is a gift of nature. This one is no exception. However, it’s a pity that it wasn’t in the Extreme North. The temperature of the outside world can’t sustain the development of this Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern. Otherwise, more ice essence might form in a few years as long as we leave some behind. If I’m not wrong, this ice cavern should have moved here as the earth’s crust changed. It shouldn’t have formed here. Even if we don’t take all this ice essence away, it will slowly disappear as the outside temperature changes. Without the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence and Divine Ice Crystals, this place will vanish completely soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “This is a miracle of the Creator! I’m already very satisfied.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress glanced at him and said, “Leave this place. In this period of time, you must place more of your attention and energy on understanding the mysteries of Ultimate Ice and the intrinsic nature of ice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress sprang up and flew towards Huo Yuhao. In the past, Huo Yuhao didn’t have any sort of feeling when that happened. After all, the Snow Lady was only a little girl then. However, she had regained her former look now. She was already very ravishing, and looked out of this world. As she flew, she was like a fairy. Even the determined Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but be slightly stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Lady waved her hands, blocking his vision. Immediately after this, she turned into a streak of flowing light and fused into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">----</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t stay any longer. He made his way into the spring before swimming out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The icy spring outside was still cold, but it was a little different from before. It had lost some of its intrinsic nature, and wasn’t able to pose any threat to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu were waiting very anxiously outside. Nan Shuishui had even tried diving in once, but the temperature was simply too low. She had no choice but to give up and wait outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao reappeared, he was immediately reprimanded by Nan Qiuqiu. He could only smile as he looked back at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, what’s your plan?” Nan Shuishui asked Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I still have to go to one place and help eldest senior find something. At the same time, I’ll need to go take a look at Big Mao and Second Mao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to go too!” Nan Qiuqiu immediately said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “Qiuqiu, don’t go. Aunty wants to move all the remaining stuff from the Earthdragon Sect over. Help her. I’ll go and return quickly. It won’t take too long. That place is already occupied by the Sun Moon Empire. It might be dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not afraid of danger,” Nan Qiuqiu immediately responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “I’m afraid even if you’re not. If you’re hurt, how can I account to Aunty?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu snorted and said, “Stop it. You just want to get away from me. Don’t think I don’t know that. No, I have to go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little helpless as he said, “Qiuqiu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She turned her head around and ignored him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Shuishui was grinning at one side, not uttering a single sound. As an elder, she wasn’t willing to intervene in the matters of young people. Furthermore, she could tell that her daughter didn’t stand a chance with Huo Yuhao even though she wanted to help her. If she tried to blindly help her daughter at one side, she might even catalyze the opposite effect. It was fine just letting Nan Qiuqiu speak for herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “Alright then. We’ll go together. However, you must listen to me. Entering the Sun Moon Empire’s territories now isn’t the same as before. If we encounter enemies, you must never be impulsive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll listen to you.” Nan Qiuqiu’s anger turned to delight, and she reacted cheerfully to his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Take a rest tonight first. We’ll set off tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Nan Qiuqiu acknowledged readily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three returned to the cloth shop as they silently left the original location of the Earthdragon Sect. Although the backyard of the cloth shop wasn’t very large, it was still possible for them to allocate a room to Huo Yuhao, while Nan Qiuqiu slept with her mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he was given his accommodations, Huo Yuhao immediately entered his room and told Nan Qiuqiu not to disturb him. He was not going to eat dinner, and was prepared to retreat in his room until the next morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had just fused a lot of Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence into his body. The faster he absorbed the ice essence, the faster his cultivation would grow. Naturally he wasn’t willing to give up on this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sat cross-legged on his bed and shut his eyes. His soul power circulated as he started to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern, he managed to discover what his problem was immediately during this session of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he had fused with a huge amount of Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, which had formed ice floes, his soul power was moving much slower as it circulated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this wouldn’t affect him in a fight, he would still take a long time to absorb all the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, given the speed of his soul power circulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to blindly increase the speed of his soul power circulation. He was afraid that the ice floes would harm him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could only take it slower. As he thought, he initiated the circulation of his soul power and also divided a part of his attention to his soul core in his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within his soul core, the compressed space was filled with immense spiritual power. A huge amount of spiritual power surged out under his command and fused into his passageways. His spiritual power fused with his Ultimate Ice soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the benefit of having great spiritual power. Even when he didn’t unleash his Spirit Eyes, his spiritual power was still at the standard of a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his spiritual power fused with his Ultimate Ice soul power, he didn’t increase the circulation speed of his soul power. Instead, he relied on his spiritual power to gather all the ice in his soul power. Slowly, he was changing the form of his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the ice essence was separated in his soul power, blindly increasing the circulation speed of his soul power could harm his passageways. However, if the ice essence formed a thin line under the effect of his spiritual power, and was then engulfed by his Ultimate Ice soul power, what would happen? The problem was immediately solved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao tried to perform such a combination, the Snow Empress watched in awe from his spiritual sea. This wasn’t something a normal seven-ringed soul master could control. Even some Titled Douluo couldn’t do this. However, Huo Yuhao relied on his soul core and immense spiritual power to do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took him a full four hours before he completed this combination and smoothed out the flow of his soul power. With sufficient spiritual power to control it, he was afraid of changes to his soul power. In such a state, he wouldn’t be affected whether he was cultivating or directly using his soul power to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recirculated his soul power according to the trajectory of his Mysterious Heaven Technique. Under the fusion and protection of his spiritual power, Huo Yuhao’s soul power circulated faster and faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, he understood why the Ice Empress was so obsessed with and in awe of the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence. In just one major circulation, Huo Yuhao could already sense an improvement in his soul power. At the very least, it was comparable to the results he obtained from several days of cultivation!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was even more impressive was that his Ultimate Ice had grown stronger. This meant the temperature of his Ultimate Ice soul power was even lower now, and was also much purer. Even his life energy had grown stronger as a result. His passageways and bones were also strengthened under the nourishment of the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s indeed very strong!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted, and immediately continued to cultivate without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His soul power had reached Rank 74. After absorbing the ice essence, Huo Yuhao sensed that his soul power had reached Rank 75. If he continued in this manner, his soul power would be bound to increase further and further. This opportunity that Nan Shuishui had brought to him was indeed very rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He performed more and more major circulations of his soul power, and slowly lost track of time. His soul power was filtered and purified. Furthermore, his soul power wasn’t the only thing absorbing the ice essence. His body, bones, passageways and organs were also absorbing this treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The energy from the six pillars of Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence was slowing being absorbed into his body. His abilities were also slowly increasing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only stopped when he sensed that his soul power was already greatly nourished, and he needed some time to adapt to the changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he opened his eyes, Huo Yuhao let out a long breath. A white mist was released from his mouth, and the entire room was instantly covered in a layer of frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a magical feeling. Huo Yuhao was very awed in his heart. His soul power circulated like mercury; it was gentle and heavy, yet it ran smoothly. With every movement he took, his soul power would surge. He was even more surprised by the fact that his soul power seemed to have gained a greater connection with the origin energy in the air. This meant that not only could he adjust his soul power in a fight, but he could also better guide the origin energy in the air for his own use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He drifted up and took a look outside. The sky was still bright outside, but he was shocked to learn how long he had spent cultivating.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surely it’s not morning, is it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he pushed his door open and walked out, Huo Yuhao immediately saw Nan Qiuqiu, who was supposed to be guarding his door, but was dozing off right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A warm feeling surged through his heart. Without a doubt, Nan Qiuqiu was here to protect him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qiuqiu.” Huo Yuhao squatted down beside Nan Qiuqiu and called softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Nan Qiuqiu was immediately jolted awake. She heaved a sigh of relief when she turned her head and saw that it was Huo Yuhao. She was surprised as she asked, “You’re awake? You’re finally awake. You said it was going to be one night, but seven days have already passed! How ridiculous can you get?”</span></p>
