He used Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track and the Tang Sect’s most basic fist techniques at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His movements were very slow. He paused almost after every punch, and he focused on understanding and sensing the changes in his soul power and spiritual power. Huo Yuhao obtained better understandings of his own abilities after every movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was very careful throughout the entire process. He relied on his formidable spiritual power to skillfully control his attacking force so that he didn’t hurt the plants around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His movements slowly began to speed up, but the golden colors released from each punch became smaller and smaller. Initially, the golden colors stretched to more than ten meters, but they were gradually withdrawn to about seven to eight meters, and then to five to six meters. By the time his body became like an illusion moving at high speed, the radiance on his fists had vanished completely, and even the undulations from his soul power and spiritual power were gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A shadow began to stretch out behind his back, but that shadow wasn’t his afterimage. Instead, it was the Goddess of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess of Light moved in the same way that he did. However, she was reflected from his body, so the two of them seemed like they were moving together, as if they were dancing on the lakeside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao practiced this set of fist techniques for two hours. When he withdrew his fists and stood up straight, the Goddess of Light appeared right in front of him and didn’t dissipate as she did the exact same thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dense golden light gradually rose around Huo Yuhao and transformed into spirals above his head as they expanded out from him, one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The past two hours had been very qualitatively transformative for Huo Yuhao. He had completely absorbed the Goldenjade Fruit’s effects, and he had used the past two hours to finally streamline and understand the changes to his body that his two new soul rings had brought about, truly grasping the strength of being a Soul Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impressive fist techniques,” a plain voice rang out, and Huo Yuhao snapped his head around and gazed into the distance. He was the only person by the lakeside before this, but there was someone else there at this moment. Wasn’t that the Beast God Di Tian, dressed in black?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian was in his human form. He stared at Huo Yuhao, and his eyes flowed with faint approval.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao bowed subtly in his direction and said, “You flatter me. I’m like the light of a firefly in front of you, elder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian smiled plainly. He seemed just like a warm elderly man at this moment as he said, “No, you are outstanding enough. You’re probably not even twenty years old, or a little older than twenty, at most. It’s no wonder the Auspicious Emperor Beast gave you her approval. You possess many special qualities that other humans don’t. You can still keep your composure in a dangerous place like this, and you can achieve one hundred percent concentration. You can already be considered very outstanding because of this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said nothing. He didn’t know how to continue the Beast God’s conversation, and the set of fist techniques that he had just displayed just happened because he felt like it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Training by yourself is so uninteresting. Why don’t I accompany you?” Di Tian’s next sentence rendered Huo Yuhao speechless with slack eyes and widened jaws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Beast God had more than eight hundred thousand years of cultivation... did he really want to fight Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder, you…” Huo Yuhao stared lifelessly at Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian smiled faintly and said, “We’re just having a practice fight. Just try your best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian made his move before his words finished registering in Huo Yuhao’s mind, and he didn’t give Yuhao time to think about it at all. He took a step forward, his hands were still behind his back as he charged toward Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao immediately felt a frightening and stifling pressure slam him in the face from the moment Di Tian made his move. That feeling resembled the same feeling he had felt in the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley, when he was completely crushed by that projection. When he was crushed back then, his body had crumbled into dust, and nothing was left!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t like he was back then. He didn’t use a single soul skill against Di Tian’s charge, because he didn’t have the time to activate his soul skills. He stood in place as he circled his hands before him with his palms facing out, and slowly pushed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian was as fast as lighting, while Huo Yuhao felt like a doddering old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, because his movement was so slow, his palms pushed out at the same moment Di Tian arrived in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment, Di Tian discovered to his surprise that Huo Yuhao had become illusory to his senses, as if he had integrated with nature around him. Huo Yuhao’s life energy and even his fortune was one with nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was sent hurtling backward, and landed on the floor after flying more than ten meters out. He stumbled as he hit the ground, and seemed like he was in disarray, but he used Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track and dispelled the impact bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian stood where he was and didn’t pursue Huo Yuhao. He tilted his head at Huo Yuhao and said, “Now I believe that the Auspicious Emperor Beast has given all her destiny and fortune to you. It’s a pity that you’re not a soul beast, and you can’t bless the Great Star Dou Forest like she did.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped moving as well. Di Tian clearly hadn’t used his full strength, but even so, he had felt as if his spirit and his blood were about to be forced out of his body from the impact when Di Tian collided with him. It had felt like a mountain had crashed into him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for showing mercy, elder,” Huo Yuhao said as he bowed towards Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian frowned and said, “You humans have so many formalities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s answer was neither haughty or humble. “This is human culture that we have inherited over the generations: filial piety, respect for one’s seniors, loyalty, politeness, honor and shame. Those things form the foundations of human culture.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian said plainly, “I don’t know about all that. However, we’re just starting. Try your best.” His body quivered as he spoke, and he charged towards Huo Yuhao once more. He moved a little faster this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to be careless. He understood from his previous experience that the Golden Eyed Black Dragon King wouldn’t deal him a fatal blow, and his footwork changed subtly as he took two quick steps out and adjusted his position. His soul power circulated smoothly and at his whim within him, and a vertical eye flickered behind his back as he merged all the forces in his body once more. His eyes turned rose-gold in color, and compared to the previous round, he managed to enter his peak condition within a much shorter period of time this time around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bam!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They clashed again, and Huo Yuhao stumbled backwards. He was pushed more than ten steps backwards before he could regain his balance. However, his situation was a lot better compared to when he was sent hurtling backwards before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian’s eyes flowed with surprise, but he said nothing as he charged at Huo Yuhao once more in a flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t dare to relax one bit. He was starting to readjust and harmonize himself when he was thrown backwards, and he made sure that his mind was calm so that everything in his body could come together as one. Huo Yuhao could feel that Di Tian’s strength was stronger in their second clash, but his own force had become a lot stronger as well. Therefore, his defense was a lot better than during their first collision. More importantly, that feeling where his spirit was almost shaken out of his body was gone, and his spiritual sea was unnaturally stable. A rose-gold vertical eye hovered above his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm’s original body was hovering in his spiritual sea. His Golden Eyes were filled with anger, and dense spiritual power flooded out from him and integrated into Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>

This figure raised her hand and knocked him on the head as she shook her head at him.</span></p>

He reluctantly stopped his actions and withdrew his spiritual undulations.</span></p>

Something else happened when he clashed with Di Tian for the third time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right before his palms pressed against Di Tian’s frame, his palms suddenly arched inwards as a gentle suction force appeared in his palms. Sucking Di Tian in with his current strength was probably futile, like an insect trying to move a tree, but Di Tian was momentarily startled when the gentle suction force appeared because he didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to do such a thing. Di Tian instinctively controlled his own power, and his forward impact naturally weakened a little.</span></p>

Furthermore, his yielding hands suddenly pushed out as he stumbled backwards, and a sphere of light flew out and slammed into Di Tian, who was hot on his heels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian’s movements didn’t stop. However, this was the first time Huo Yuhao had retaliated!</span></p>

Huo Yuhao and Di Tian clashed once more, but Huo Yuhao was sent flying through the air because he was preoccupied with retaliation.</span></p>

He was very determined, and he had already gone through so many of life’s tribulations.</span></p>

At least, he was able to put some distance between Di Tian and himself. A longing look flowed from his eyes, and he seemed to turn transparent all over when he withdrew his right fist.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, she seemed different from before – this time, Wang Dong’er’s projection was colorful, as if she had actually descended beside Huo Yuhao. She was smiling beautifully, and her charming eyes were tinged with bashfulness as her long and pinkish-blue hair draped over her shoulders. She twirled her hair with her fingers playfully, and there was even a subtle sassiness at the corner of her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, this was the most beautiful Wang Dong’er in Huo Yuhao’s heart. Dong’er was behind him, and she was also in his heart.</span></p>

He allowed Huo Yuhao to raise his fist’s aura to its highest possible level.</span></p>

Even the Golden Eyed Black Dragon King was full of admiration at the sight.</span></p>

Not even many Transcendent Douluo can reach a level of integration and fusion like this, can they?</span></p>
