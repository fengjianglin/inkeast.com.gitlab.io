 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He punched her thigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” Lan Ruoruo screamed in pain. As she smacked her left hand against the ground, she quickly slid back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was a Soul Emperor, but Huo Yuhao was a Soul King with twin martial souls! His human-shaped soul tool was made entirely from rare metals. After Huo Yuhao poured his soul power into it, it became extremely resilient. She couldn’t easily overcome it with her strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, Lan Ruoruo clearly sensed an extremely cold aura entering her left leg. Right now, her left thigh had gone completely numb, and she couldn’t feel anything there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had no intention of letting her go. Suddenly, his body shone with golden light, and an indescribable aura was released from his body. His silvery-white human-shaped soul tool turned completely golden, and the majestic aura that it released put a lot of pressure on Lan Ruoruo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Lan Ruoruo felt as if she were facing a Titled Douluo. She couldn’t help but scream again, and she quickly retreated as she jumped on one leg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao snorted coldly. He stepped forward with his left leg and punched his right fist out. Suddenly, a bright golden fist projection flashed in the air before it disappeared. Instantly, it came before Lan Ruoruo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She frantically used her dagger to resist the fist projection, and it was eventually destroyed. However, the gold that spread from this fist projection still struck her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She felt as if her body had fallen apart. An indescribable spiritual trauma seemed to cause her to be rapidly paralyzed. Her internal soul power seemed to have been restrained by that invisible force, and her mind seemed to lose its connection to her body. The figure in front of her was too strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wasn’t hurt by soul power or the fist. She was hurt by spiritual power of Huo Yuhao’s Sovereign’s Descent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had the Soul Power Amplifier that he had created. The formation arrays of his amplifier were above his right fist. It enabled his human-shaped soul tool to unleash his strongest attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Sovereign’s Descent was unleashed through his amplifier, which greatly enhanced the strength of his attack. However, Huo Yuhao was also slightly regretful. If his amplifier was large enough to be placed in front of his chest, his overall abilities would grow by another level as he enhanced all of his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was still delighted that his attack was successful. That was because he knew that he was slowly grasping how a human-shaped soul tool greatly enhanced a soul master’s abilities. It wasn’t just about the Soul Power Amplifier; there were many other methods that could be used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire venue went silent. Huo Yuhao won just like that. He even won comfortably. His human-shaped soul tool was actually so quick and deft. The last strike involved his own self-invented fighting technique, which was very rare even among soul masters. Lan Ruoruo – a Class 6 soul engineer and six-ringed Soul Emperor – lost her fighting strength after she was struck by the fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, no one knew that Huo Yuhao had used his Ultimate Ice on Lan Ruoruo earlier. She suffered because she was careless. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been so easily struck by his Sovereign’s Descent earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tang Wu wins.” Ye Yulin descended from the sky, stunned as he looked at Huo Yuhao. There was also a look of admiration on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s succeeded. He’s really succeeded. From the agility of his human-shaped soul tool earlier, I can tell that the combination of mechanical components and formation arrays in his soul tool is already perfect. His Soul Power Amplifier isn’t too impressive though. After all, the difficulty of making such an amplifier depends on the quality of materials available.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a human-shaped soul tool can enable a disabled person to fight with so much agility. This is a success. His Highness will certainly like a human-shaped soul tool like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone from the Duskwater Alliance felt extremely at ease now. He Caitou and Huo Yuhao had both competed, and both of them didn’t even give their opponents a chance. They had already taken half the spots in the semifinal. The Duskwater Alliance was in a very favorable situation now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third match was between the lady in yellow from the Common Alliance and the last remaining soul engineer from the Alto Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both parties didn’t intend to give up on this opportunity, and they fought very intensely. Eventually, the lady in yellow attained victory. She defeated her opponent using her long sword, a close-combat soul tool, and advanced to the next round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last match was between Huang Zheng and a lady in red from the Common Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Zheng, who always seemed very composed, finally demonstrated his ruthlessness in this match. His claw-shaped soul tool was useful for both close-range and long-range attacks. At the same time, he was determined enough not to be seduced by his opponent. Eventually, he chopped off one of his opponent’s arms and forced her to concede defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The semifinalists were He Caitou, Huo Yuhao, Huang Zheng and the lady in yellow, who was called Ye Guyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao and He Caitou were troubled after the draw was made for the semifinals. They drew each other. They were going to face each other in the semifinal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s good like that too. You’ll have enough time to rest. I’ll forfeit this round.” He Caitou announced his forfeit, and Huo Yuhao successfully advanced to the finals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Wan was delighted with He Caitou’s decision to forfeit. This proved that Tang Si was inferior to Tang Wu. In addition, Tang Wu could conserve his fighting strength for the final. Of course, it would be great if Tang Wu and Huang Zheng were the finalists. The Duskwater Alliance would win no matter what if that happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second semifinal round was Ye Guyi from the Common Alliance versus Huang Zheng from the Duskwater Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both competitors went up to the stage. Ye Guyi was the prettiest among the three representatives from the Common Alliance. However, she wore a cold look at this point. While Lan Ruoruo lost to Huo Yuhao, she didn’t suffer any injuries. However, the lady in red was critically hurt by Huang Zheng. Even if her amputated arm was reattached, it might not be as agile as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi coldly glared at Huang Zheng and sternly said, “If you are a man, you’ll fight until the end. Don’t concede defeat.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Zheng laughed coldly, “You’ll have the opportunity to tell whether I’m a man in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin!” Ye Yulin couldn’t be bothered with their trash talk. He immediately announced the start of the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi pointed her toes to the ground and burst towards Huang Zheng like a patch of yellow clouds. Huang Zheng rested his claw-shaped soul tool on his right arm. As he lifted it slightly, the three sharp claws at the front shot out three-feet long light blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These light blades were used to chop off the arm of the lady in red earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huang Zheng lifted his claws, he shot his light blades towards Ye Guyi like bolts of lightning. Not only could his light blades be used for close-combat, they were also very effective for long-range attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After locking onto the opponent, these light blades spiraled out and intercepted Ye Guyi from different directions as they drew arcs in the air. They weren’t easy to be dodged. Furthermore, they were extremely sharp, and very explosive. Resisting them without any protective soul barriers was bound to deplete the target greatly. Huang Zheng called them Soulchase Claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After unleashing his three sharp blades, Huang Zheng unleashed yet another three light blades from his claws. He was advancing quickly towards Ye Guyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi wasn’t afraid as she faced these spiraling light blades. Earlier, she had already witnessed Huang Zheng’s fighting style. The lady in red had suffered as the blades blew apart. Ye Guyi wasn’t going to make the same mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She turned her wrist, and a long sword appeared in her grasp. This sword was around three feet and three inches long. The blade of her sword was one inch thick, and it emanated a bright golden light. There were seven stars on the sword, and three formation arrays. While there were only three of them, they were very small. Miniature formation arrays such as these could only be made using advanced techniques.</span></p>
