At this moment, the weather changed, and even the Third Elder was moved.</span></p>

Her bloodshot eyes turned clear again, and she died a glad woman. Wu Yu was stunned when she saw this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you.</span></p>

I miss my mommy and daddy. Why did you have to die so early? Why didn’t you protect me? Why did you let that fatso abuse me and leave me humiliated in front of countless people in that cold basement? They destroyed my body under the instigation of that fatso, ravaging my heart and staining my spirit. I was only fifteen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hatred kept me alive and enhanced my spirit to another level. My Spirit of Vengeance was awakened as a result. I hate those greedy and lecherous men, and I hate that fatso who tore me to pieces. I want to slaughter them, but I’m in so much pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I finally being released? You let me see the light, sense what remembrance is, and witness a love that’s yet to appear in my spirit. It seems like not everything in this world is dirty. There are still pure and clean things. Thank you, thank you for letting me sense the intense love you have for that unknown person. You cleansed my heart and let me know what release is. Thank you, I’m very happy, I’m very happy…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While there were many people around, Wu Yun’s voice still sounded very clear on this abnormally quiet night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the soul engineers of the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion, this mournful voice only moved them. However, the Third and Fourth Elders, as well as Wu Yu, were all astonished by Wu Yun’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yu was even trembling uncontrollably, and she muttered to herself, “Elder sister, elder sister, how could you bear to leave me alone…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trying to escape?” The Third Elder shouted as he witnessed this scene. He smacked his right hand down, and a bluish-black lightning dragon instantly surfaced from his arm. Huo Yuhao, Nan Qiuqiu and Nan Shuishui all turned into bubbles and disappeared, while this lightning dragon charged downwards immediately. It unleashed a lightning net that engulfed a huge plot of space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire air seemed to be suffused with a smell that resembled ultraviolet rays coming from sunlight on a bright day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst this lightning net, three sorry figures appeared slightly more than a hundred meters away from where Huo Yuhao and the other two had disappeared earlier.</span></p>

However, he still felt his body turning numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the strength of a Class 9 soul engineer! He had managed to make the three of them reappear easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the only successful person to have completed the Ultimate Soldier Plan, Huo Yuhao had no intention of giving up, even though he was in a precarious situation right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had almost succeeded in using his Imitation to confuse his opponents, which included two Titled Douluo, and escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky was completely sealed, so their only chance of escape was through the ground. They only stood a chance if they entered the city and exploited the complex geography and messy situation to their advantage. At the same time, Huo Yuhao had to rely on his Spiritual Interference Domain and Imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Third Elder had reacted too quickly, and killed off their hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t tell what soul tool the Third Elder was using. However, the tremendous suppression he was under caused him to become completely immobilized as he unleashed his Domain of Perpetual Ice. The difference in their abilities was simply too huge. Even though his soul power was already at Rank 60, he was still technically a Soul King because of the number of soul rings he had. The gap between a Soul King and Titled Douluo, and a Class 6 and Class 9 soul engineer, was undoubtedly too big for him to make up the difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could sense that his opponent didn’t intend to kill the three of them, he wanted to capture them alive. That was likely because of Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu, the Third Elder couldn’t bear to kill them. Could Huo Yuhao only find an opportunity to escape after being captured?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao still had a few trump cards that he hadn’t used yet. However, these trump cards seemed a little too useless against a Class 9 soul engineer. What should he do? While he was normally very adaptable, he couldn’t think of a way to free himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The image that he had formed using his Imitation had disappeared, and Wu Yu was staring at him with completely red eyes. She said to the Third Elder coldly, “I want him alive. I want to make him my human puppet and whip him every day. I want to torture him until it feels worse than death, so as to avenge my elder sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yu’s voice was very sharp. Huo Yuhao could hear her words clearly, and his heart sank when he heard them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t afraid of death. However, his life was going to be a living hell if he landed in the same state as Feng Ling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, he didn’t want to take any chances, and wanted to conserve his abilities before trying to escape later on. However, he became more determined to escape after hearing Wu Yu’s words. No matter what, he couldn’t land in their hands. He would rather die than be captured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned to the northeast and looked into the sky. A trace of blue appeared in the pitch-black sky far away, and he seemed to see Wang Dong’er’s sleeping figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong’er, I’m sorry. I might not be able to wait until you wake up.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forget it, just let me die. Even if I die, I’ll bring my yearning for you along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought until here, Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened. His eyes turned clearer, and a sense of yearning spread from him. His willpower soared, and golden light emanated from his body, illuminating his pitch-black surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third and Fourth Elders, as well as Wu Yu, were all some of the strongest individuals around. They immediately reacted when they saw the changes Huo Yuhao was experiencing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder waved his hand, “Everyone, retreat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul engineers from the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion weren’t up to such a high-level fight, unless they were willing to sacrifice their lives to destroy Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looks like he’s only slightly past twenty, but why is his willpower so strong? How did he manage to reach such a cultivation? Even Wu Yun died at his hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with the Third and Fourth Elder’s cultivations, they were still very serious when they sensed the strength of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual cultivation. It wasn’t difficult for them to kill him, but it would be tedious for them to capture him alive. They were very curious about him, too. Whether it was his soul skills, like Imitation and Spiritual Interference, his cultivation, or his abnormal spiritual power, he was the kind of research subject that the Holy Ghost Church liked. If they tried to destroy him, Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu were unlikely to escape the repercussions. While the Third Elder sounded very unfeeling, he would have simply attacked them if he no longer had feelings for Nan Shuishui. Why would he have waited until now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, another streak of golden light that resonated with Huo Yuhao’s strong willpower shone far away in the east. Furthermore, this streak of golden light seemed even brighter. It was like the sun rising in the east. There was a dominant aura about it as it rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Huo Yuhao was stunned when he saw this. This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Holy Ghost Church didn’t know, but he was clearly aware of the fact that he had no reinforcements.

However, it isn’t possible for her to release a streak of golden light.</span></p>

Deafening dragon roars also reverberated across the sky, and the sky turned bright gold.</span></p>

In the Third Elder’s opinion, Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly escape given his cultivation. That was why both him and the Fourth Elder turned their attention to the sudden change occurring far away. After all, they didn’t know how many people had come with Huo Yuhao, and how many strong individuals there were. Although Wu Yu had obtained some information from Feng Ling, Feng Ling was in an unstable mental state. It was difficult to tell how credible he was. It was just like how she didn’t know what time the Tang Sect was supposed to make their move.</span></p>

The hundred soul engineers in the air also adopted a new formation to target the incoming streak of golden light. Thirty of them split into groups of five, and each group was in charge of helming a huge soul tool. These soul tools seemed like pentagrams, and there were metal poles extending from its corners. Every pole was lifted on a soul engineer’s shoulder, while the center contained a ball-like entity that resembled an eye. Dark-blue light shone above this ball-like entity, and intense soul power undulations poured from it.</span></p>

However, the shocking thing was that no explosion rang out. The streak of golden light was quickly dissipated by the net, and converted into spots of golden light that scattered in mid-air.</span></p>
