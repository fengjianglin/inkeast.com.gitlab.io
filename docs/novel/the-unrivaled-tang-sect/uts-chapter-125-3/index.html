 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden halo spread out, signalling the start of Hongchen’s Yearning. A whirlpool-shaped ray of reddish-golden light transformed into a flood that rained straight towards the void-like figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reddish-golden light was filled with the clanging of metal and the toughness of ice. More terrifyingly, the air started to distort from its heat the moment it appeared. Various contradictory elements gathered together, forming a madness that was seemingly twisted and hysterical. Illuminated by the reddish-golden light of Hongchen’s Yearning, the entire tournament stage seemingly transformed into a sea of magma.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it wasn’t able to obstruct that golden ring of light from spreading outwards regardless of how strong it was. When the extremely soft ray of golden light passed through the violent, reddish-gold wave without any obstruction, it instantly reached the enormous figure of the reddish-gold toad, making it tremble violently. Right after that, the reddish-gold light suddenly collapsed, revealing Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen’s falling figures.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Hongchen’s Yearning was even able to release a third of its power, it ended unexpectedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The siblings had blank looks on their faces, as though they had lost their sense of self, to the extent where they couldn’t even control their descent from the sky. As they fell, snake-like wisps of blood started to surge out from Xiao Hongchen’s seven apertures.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying Hongchen’s Yearning had only lasted for a brief instant. Although it still filled the entire tournament stage, nothing happened afterwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it still couldn’t be blocked so easily. The terrifying might caused by melting gold into steel landed, immediately causing the entire tournament stage to boil as though a volcano had erupted. The madness of metal and the poison from the Vermillion Clear Icetoad, along with the fusion of ice and fire, caused the wide tournament stage to turn into a hell on earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void-like figure was about to be swallowed up. At this moment, the Heavenfiend Douluo Huang Xujin hadn’t woken up from the golden light’s effect. This meant that he simply wouldn’t be able to rescue them as a referee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan already had one foot outstretched, but Wang Yan tugged on his sleeve just before he made a move.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan flew into a rage, “What should I be waiting for? For them to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he suddenly quietened down after uttering these words. To his astonishment, he saw that the void-like figure didn’t just resign itself to its fate in front of the surging Hongchen’s Yearning. Instead, it floated backwards at a lightning-quick rate, revealing Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s bodies again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the eyes of the enormous audience, another mysterious change occurred to their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bluish-gold pair of wings was once again unfurled, revealing the Radiant Butterfly Goddess. However, Huo Yuhao’s shirt suddenly burst open, revealing the enormous tattoo of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. It seemed as though there was some kind of power that was trying to burst out from his swelling muscles, and the jade-green tail of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion stretched all the way to his waist. Naturally, his buttocks couldn’t be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the tattoo of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion seemed to come alive. This was especially true for its crystal-yellow eyes, which emitted a wild aura that made it seem as though it was the only sovereign in the entire world.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a situation like this, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong once again hugged each other. They looked at each other for an instant, and everything else seemed to disappear, leaving only the other’s determination in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had two martial souls, which were the Spirit Eyes and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong also had two martial souls, which were the Radiant Butterfly Goddess and the Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Spirit Eyes fused with the Radiant Butterfly Goddess, they could use their first fusion skill--A Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Spirit Eyes fused with the Clear Sky Hammer, they could use what they had just used earlier--the golden ring of light that could cover over a hundred metres.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was their third fusion skill, and it was called Mantra Amidst the Void, Spiritual Tempest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Tempest was equivalent to taking the Clear Sky Hammer’s most powerful attack and fusing it with Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock. Moreover, it was a large-scale attack, and possessed an attack power that was many times greater than that of the two aforementioned skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, this fusion skill drained much less soul power than the other two. However, its demand on their spiritual power was extremely terrifying. Were it not for the fact that Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea had been strengthened immensely by the Life Gold, he would’ve immediately fainted after using it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Life Gold had opened Huo Yuhao’s third eye, allowing Electrolux to sleep within it. However, Huo Yuhao didn’t know that the place Electrolux had used the Life Gold to carve out for himself could be considered a second spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than their initial testing, this was the second time they had used the Spiritual Tempest. However, its power this time around had increased explosively due to Huo Yuhao’s second spiritual sea. Combined with the Life Deprivation given to him by the Life Guardian, they were able to instantly interrupt Hongchen’s Yearning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the two fusion skills that could be used by combining Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes with either of Wang Dong’s martial souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what if it were the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fusion between the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion and the Clear Sky Hammer was the most powerful attack at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s disposal. Previously, even the Absolute Defense Barrier had been shattered by that attack, which was known as the Blaze Amidst the Frost, Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, what Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were using at this very moment was the last fusion skill at their disposal, the fusion between the two insect-type martial souls, that of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion and the Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In terms of pure offensive capabilities, this fusion skill wasn’t as powerful as the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer. However, this was the only fusion skill that was controlled by Wang Dong. In terms of flexibility, this skill was comparable to that of the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer, which staked everything for a single, all-out attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A supernova that seemed as though a myriad rays of light had exploded spread out from Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s bodies. This light was so intense that nobody dared to even look at it directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the surging Hongchen’s Yearning was forced to slow down due to that intense light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right after that, the bluish-gold pair of wings started to spread outwards at an astonishing rate. Within the blink of an eye, they had already doubled in size.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, the Radiant Butterfly Goddess only had a pair of front and rear wings. At this moment however, it now had a pair of jade-colored middle wings which were as transparent as a gem, and extremely alluring. An intense aura of life blossomed outwards, with a true essence of light and water. This dense aura of life complemented the aura of light extremely well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the dazzling pair of butterfly wings unfurled, the three colors of blue, gold, and green seemed to be embellished with countless rays of light. There seemed to be countless drops of water gently rolling around the butterfly wings, reflecting every single ray of light within their surroundings that could be reflected. Tens of thousands of rays of light shone forth, but layers of frost started to emanate from its feet, causing that slender figure to look ever so noble.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The frost quietly diffused, causing the surroundings to turn into a world of ice and snow. As the chilly aura started to spread out, an astonishing change occurred to Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s fused body. A slender figure had noiselessly appeared amidst the three-colored halo of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This figure was a girl, a girl who had already matured. This girl was over 1.8 meters tall, and her slender figure looked extremely moving and thrilling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a head full of bluish-pink hair which fell all the way to her feet. Her eyes were a brilliant gold, and even the word ‘perfection’ wasn’t sufficient to describe her moving, slender body. Her perfect looks eclipsed every single other girl within the arena, and every ray of light and curve on her body fitted extremely well. Nobody could even describe the first thing they felt when seeing her, but every single man and woman in the arena was completely drawn to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next instant, she made a move. After taking a slight step forward with her left leg, the slender woman was now in midair. The three differently-colored wings on her back had carried her slender figure upwards into the air in a graceful and light manner.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a small crack was carved open from the murky clouds in the sky. A ray of sunlight descended from the sky, passing through the tournament stage’s defensive barrier before landing on her.</span></p>

Bathed within the warm sunlight, she danced a Raiment of Light.</span></p>

Her three differently-colored wings continued to stretch outwards and fold inwards, making her noble figure look even more dazzling and brilliant.</span></p>

Then, the strong undulations of spiritual power caused her to fall into a mysterious state.</span></p>

It was as though it had only appeared to supplement the appearance of the beauty who could overturn cities.</span></p>
