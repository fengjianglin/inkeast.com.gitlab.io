After sending off the two sect masters, he quickly returned to his bed and sat cross-legged. He focused his mind and circulated his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he combined his consciousness and the Mysterious Heaven Technique’s soul power, he suddenly felt very clear. Due to his fusion with the Snow Empress, the problems with his spiritual sea had already been resolved. His spiritual power had risen instead of fallen. His entire spiritual sea was back in its Boundless Ocean state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady swam in his spiritual sea, occasionally exuding orange-gold light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could sense that a part of the origin energy of heaven and earth would fuse into the Snow Lady’s body as he cultivated, nourishing her. This outpouring of energy wouldn’t affect his cultivation speed. On the contrary, the speeds he cultivated at the Mysterious Heaven Technique were faster with her presence. Apart from the portion of the energy the Snow Lady absorbed, his own cultivation speed increased significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he had become a Soul King after gaining a fifth soul ring. Although his soul power was still a little rigid in his body, its overall circulation surged more and more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inside of his body was completely engulfed in gold. It wasn’t just from the Mysterious Heaven Technique, but also his spiritual power. He could sense that his body was changing drastically under the effect of his immense soul and spiritual power. It was as if he was evolving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t sure how long this would last, but he hoped that it would last forever. As his body evolved, his tolerance level would also increase. His spiritual sea felt as if it was growing due to the Snow Lady’s spiritual power, but that feeling would disappear as his body got stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After fusing with the Snow Lady’s Spirit, there was only one word to describe Huo Yuhao’s condition—metamorphosis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao spent an entire day in deep meditation. When he opened his eyes again, the sky was already bright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The metamorphosis of his body was still ongoing, but its speed had dropped significantly. He jumped off from his bed and stretched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only heard his bones cracking softly, and he was stunned to find out that he had grown taller. There were even lesser striations on his developed muscles, but the changes to his skin were far more astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had obtained a healthy, bronze complexion after years of tireless cultivation. Although this complexion made him seem very masculine, he had neglected skin care due to his hectic schedule of cultivation, which made his skin seem rough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After one day and night of cultivation, he was stunned to realize that his complexion had whitened a little. Although he was still bronze, there was a layer of dim light beneath his skin. This made the surface of his skin appear finer and smoother. The signs of aging that had accumulated had all disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Am I seeing things?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;This was his first reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He rushed to the washroom and looked at himself in the mirror. He was stunned. He couldn’t even believe that he was the person in the mirror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still the same Huo Yuhao. However, his body and face seemed to have experienced some slight but weird changes. It was these slight changes that had caused his appearance to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lines on his face had become more obvious, and they were now filled with a masculine aura. In his eyes, his calm gaze revealed a sense of dignity. His skin was indeed smooth, but it was different from a young girl’s skin. His skin was filled with a healthy, masculine aura. At least to him, he felt that he had become more handsome after this change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He faced the mirror and couldn’t help but ask himself, “Is, is this still me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This shouldn’t be changes that occurred because of the increase in my cultivation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He finally understood. The Snow Lady was the reason why his appearance experienced such drastic changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She even called me daddy, but she doesn’t look like me at all. I seemed to have changed because of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of this point, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Since when could a daughter change their father’s appearance? However, such a thing had happened to him. Had she despised her father because he was too ugly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but laugh in the end. As he thought of something, lights flashed, and the Snow Lady crawled out. However, she didn’t crawl out of his Eye of Destiny, but his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evidently, it wasn’t only his body that was evolving. The Snow Lady was also becoming more and more familiar with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to the day before, the Snow Lady seemed to have grown slightly. She was still an infant, but she was even cuter now. When she saw his reflection in the mirror, she starting chuckling and clapping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a little shy as he said, “Little fellow, did you despise me because I was ugly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady shook her head, but her deep blue eyes revealed her laughing intent. He wanted to hug her, but she turned into a streak of flowing light. In this state, she could change at anytime, so he grabbed onto nothing as he tried to catch her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she opened her mouth, she sucked water from the tap in the washroom and spat it onto Huo Yuhao’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he possessed the Ultimate Ice, he still shivered as he was struck by the cold water! She laughed cheekily and escaped. She seemed very delighted as she flew around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had absolutely no idea how to deal with her. Seeing that she was so happy, he also became more relaxed. He suddenly thought of what it would be like if he really had a daughter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of it, he unwittingly thought of that figure deeply imprinted in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong, is your twin sister fertile?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face blushed, and his heart rate increased. After all, he was only seventeen years old, and was still exploring his emotions. He didn’t realize this when he was cultivating normally. However, romantic feelings had started to develop in him after he met Ju Zi and saw the Goddess of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? The two sect masters are here.” Huo Yuhao was stunned to discover that he could sense presences outside even without using his Spiritual Detection. He even knew who they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the two of them could knock on the door, he took the initiative to open the door himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian smiled as he asked, “Your cultivation has ended?” As he looked at Huo Yuhao, he was slightly surprised. “Yuhao, why do I feel like you’re different from yesterday?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao invited both of them in and said, “Uncle Niu, I feel the same way. It seems like my body has been changing under the Snow Lady’s influence after I fused with her. I’m not clear on how much it’ll change. However, my body and spiritual power have become stronger. My telepathy with her has also grown. Even my skin and appearance have changed slightly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Niu Tian nodded and pressed his hand on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. A gentle soul power was poured into his body, which seemed to cleanse him as it circulated one round through his passageways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only felt a sense of warmth engulfing his body. It was extremely comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, your Spirit is impressive!” Niu Tian complimented with a shocked look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Huo Yuhao was puzzled as he looked at him</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian took a look at Tai Tan, but realized that he was staring at the Snow Lady and wasn’t paying attention to them. He sighed in his heart, “It seems like we’re too lonely.”</span></p>

You should know, that there are different bottlenecks at different stages of a soul master’s cultivation. Once he breaks through these bottlenecks, his cultivation will improve significantly. One of the greatest stages is between the sixth and seventh ring. The soul master’s martial soul will completely awaken its strength, and they’ll gain a Martial Soul True Body.”</span></p>

Because he was a genius from Shrek Academy, he wouldn’t dismiss Niu Tian’s words as simple numbers.</span></p>

Even so, he was only Rank 50, miles away from Rank 70.</span></p>

While he possessed the Violet Goldbear, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s martial souls were stronger than his. However, they only managed to beat him after unleashing all of their abilities—continuously using their martial soul fusion skills and Huo Yuhao’s understanding of the Sovereign’s Descent. Why was this the case? That was because Zhao Yang possessed a Martial Soul True Body.</span></p>

However, he was on an entirely different level since he gained a seventh soul ring that allowed him to use his Martial Soul True Body. No matter how talented Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were, they had to be very careful against someone who possessed a Martial Soul True Body. They had to team up to put up any resistance at all.</span></p>
