 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s face turned bitter, “Third senior, you know how painful it is to be under heavy pressure. Am I not in pain then? Because of your words, I don’t even dare to return to the academy anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi sighed and changed the topic. He said, “When the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion comes and holds down the fort at Dou Ling City, watch my mom deal with those officials and generals. Even though she steps out of line with her words sometimes, she’s still very intelligent. I inherited her intelligence. It’s much better for her to control the empire. At least she grew up in the imperial palace. She must have learned some tips and tricks on how to be the ruler of an empire. What do I know? I’ve been played by those officials and generals. It appears that I’m a prince, but none of my orders have worked out. They always seem to find a reason to challenge me. Things are better now. I can just walk away. The Tang Sect is much more comfortable! As for your problem, you can settle it yourself. If you’re really unwilling to handle it, I can help you tell the others. I’ll just say you and Wutong are both fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao twisted his lips and said, “Are you doing this for my own good? It concerns too many things in this world. How can I just put it down? Oh yes, third senior, how has the situation in the Sun Moon Empire been during this period of time I took Wutong for treatment? Has the Sun Moon Empire done anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi shook his head and replied, “I’m not sure. You should also know that the Sun Moon Empire is the best at hiding any information. If they really want to seal off any information, no one will know anything. The Sun Moon Empire’s army has disappeared. They should be in the Heavenly Soul Empire. As for exactly where, no one knows. Who knows when they’ll reappear? They only have two targets – the Dou Ling Empire and the Star Luo Empire. Oh right, it seems like the academy has become more generous. Not only have they asked the elites from the Dou Ling Empire to return, but they’ve also sent the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion over to help. Why is this so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled and answered, “If you have so many Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells, you’ll naturally be more generous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Xu Sanshi screamed. “Yuhao, don’t tell me that you robbed the Sun Moon Empire’s imperial palace? Otherwise, how could you have so many Class 9 shells? They’re strategic resources. Even the Sun Moon Empire rarely uses them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao told him about how he had robbed the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion. After hearing his story, Xu Sanshi gave him a thumbs-up. Xu Sanshi really wanted to kill everyone from those two soul engineer legions that Huo Yuhao had been up against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, what are your plans after returning to the sect? Are you going to revamp the sect, or what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought about it for a moment before replying, “The situation is a little complicated right now. I need to gather first-hand intelligence before I can decide what to do. I won’t return with all of you this time. When you see Elder Xuan after returning, relay the message that both Wutong and I are fine. We are going to the Sun Moon Empire to obtain some intelligence. We’ll report back once we’ve obtained something reliable. Furthermore, we’ll also do something to try to delay their army.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, I knew you were going to run away again. Alright, you can go. However, you must take care of your safety! Haih, I’m really worrying too much. Given your current abilities, especially your concealment ability, it’ll be difficult for anyone to deal with you. Not even an Ultimate Douluo will find it easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I’m not that optimistic either. Nothing’s impossible. Not only is the Holy Ghost Church after me, but I believe Di Tian is also watching me. He might appear at any time. Do you really think I can fight Di Tian given my current abilities?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi shuddered a little. “Little junior, don’t scare me. If that’s the case, we should split earlier. Both of you can still flee. What about us? It’s best to have fewer people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw him acting afraid. Ye Guyi suddenly flew over and was a little indignant as she said, “Why is he an Ultimate Douluo now? Huo Yuhao, challenge me to a duel if you dare.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at her and sincerely said, “Guyi, thanks for your help this time. If not for you, everyone might not have hung on until we came.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi’s face turned cold and she replied, “You’ve never treated me as one of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Why do you say that?” Huo Yuhao was astonished as he looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi coldly answered, “I’m also a part of the Tang Sect. It’s only right that I protect my comrades. Why are you thanking me in such a superior manner? I’m challenging you to a duel!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was confused as he looked at her. He sighed and asked, “Alright then. Where?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Here.” Ye Guyi pointed to the sky. Her six wings fluttered as she rose into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little helpless as he shook his head. He also flew up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan furrowed her brow. Xu Sanshi was even more shocked. “What is she trying to do? She wants to fight even though she just got here. Yuhao is also another one. Why did he agree?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong smiled at one side and commented, “She’s liked him for so long. It’s only right that she’s using him to vent right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was curious, “You know about it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong revealed a helpless look in her big, pinkish-blue eyes, “I’m not blind. Can’t I tell how she looks at Yuhao? In fact, I think I’m the one she really wants to challenge. However, she believes she can’t stop if she fights me. That’s why she’s using Yuhao to vent. No worries, I don’t mind letting her vent. It’s all for the harmony of the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi gave her thumbs-up as he wore an admiring look on his face. “Magnanimous! You have the demeanor of a big-hearted woman. Why don’t you let Yuhao have a few mistresses? I believe the Tang Sect will grow big and strong if he’s willing to open his mouth. Perhaps that War God Empress will come to the Tang Sect. Perhaps Shrek Academy is the one that will rule the continent in the end. Hahaha! Wutong, why are you looking at me like that? I feel a little uncomfortable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong snapped at him, “I think you’re looking for it. Come, let me challenge you too. Ever since I became a Transcendent Douluo, I haven’t really fought before. You can be my guinea pig. I can help you build your foundation to make a breakthrough as a Titled Douluo too. Sister Nannan, surely you won’t stop me, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan’s expression was also back to normal now. “Some people’s mouths are just loose. They deserved to be beaten up. Wutong, don’t leave any face for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were speaking, a fight had already begun in the air. Against Huo Yuhao, Ye Guyi had no intention of showing mercy. Her body immediately shone with golden light the moment she started. She unleashed her martial soul true body immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wore a bitter look on his face. He only focused on defending himself, and allowed Ye Guyi to assault him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he easily dispelled all her attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had to be admitted that Ye Guyi’s attacks were very strong. Huo Yuhao was also very impressed by them. When the fight was over, his shirt was already damaged in many areas. There were even a few spots that were charred, and he had to change before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi was also completely drained. She only stopped her attacks after she used the last streak of her soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only paid the price of a piece of shirt. After the fight was over, Ye Guyi appeared to be more relieved. However, she still maintained her silence during the journey back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an hour, they separated. Huo Yuhao held onto Tang Wutong as they proceeded in the direction of the Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi waved them goodbye with one hand and used his other hand to rub the bruises on his face. Tang Wutong’s abilities had increased drastically. Even his Xuanwu Shield wasn’t sufficient to defend against her. However, Tang Wutong still gave Jiang Nannan some face. She didn’t really whack him badly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Does this lass not know not to hit someone in the face?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was displeased as he complained to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the Heavenly Soul Empire was within sight. Huo Yuhao was holding onto Tang Wutong, but there was a melancholic expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire was gone. It had been wiped from the face of this earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Sun Moon Empire occupied the entire Heavenly Soul Empire, more than half the territories of the entire continent came under their control. Ever since the Douluo Continent had formed, no empire had occupied such a huge proportion of the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires teamed up, they weren’t strong enough to fight the Sun Moon Empire. While one person’s fighting strength could decide victory in a fight, it couldn’t change the overall situation in the entire continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regarding this, Huo Yuhao was very clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire would never stop the war. As human-shaped soul tools kept on developing, their powers were going to increase by leaps and bounds in the short-term.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the human-shaped soul tools currently used by the Sun Moon Empire, it seemed like they were rather simple. Only the Class 9 ones were strong enough. It was unknown how those lower-tier soul engineers were able to control those human-shaped soul tools, but it was certain that they were still rather impressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under this circumstance, the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions would become even stronger once they were able to equip their soul engineers with more human-shaped soul tools. If the human-shaped soul tools meant that the soul engineer legions could carry more stationary shells and Milk Bottles and increase their defensive strength, that was enough for their overall abilities to increase significantly.</span></p>
