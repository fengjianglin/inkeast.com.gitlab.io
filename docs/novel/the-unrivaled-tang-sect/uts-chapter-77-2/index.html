 <p><strong>Book 11: The Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 77.2: This Daddy has a Rough Cigar!</strong></p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng said, “The same goes for me.”</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen also nodded and said, “I’m recovering as expected.”</p>
 <p>“That’s good,” Wang Yan said. He then looked towards the seven members of the preparatory team, who were led by Bei Bei. “In your first match, you showed your opponents just how powerful Shrek Academy is. To be more accurate, you increased Shrek’s reputation even further. I’ve been observing the other academies’ matches during the past few days, and listening to the reactions brought about by your first battle; the effects you all achieved were much better than we could’ve expected. Our Shrek Academy has become the manifestation of ‘mysterious and powerful’ in the eyes of the other academies. They have no idea what our true strength is, while Huo Yuhao definitely became the center of attention. Furthermore, thanks to the show orchestrated by Yuhao and myself that day, he’s become the leader of the team in all of their eyes.”</p>
 <p>“To us, it’s already like that!” Bei Bei said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao blushed as he said, “Senior brother, please stop joking. As weak as I am, how could I be the leader?”</p>
 <p>“Even though strength is definitely the most important attribute in this tournament, not everything depends on it,” Bei Bei resolutely replied, “wasn’t your performance in the first match absolutely incredible? Who among those seated there could’ve done a better job than you? I don’t think that even the three students of the inner courtyard could have defeated them with a single move like you did.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao smiled and said, “What Bei Bei says is right. Your performance that day was simply amazing. Even though your cultivation isn’t that high, even we have to admit that that soul skill of yours is really quite incredible—especially when you use it play tricks.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao would always get embarrassed whenever he was faced by Ma Xiaotao. However, the nearby Wang Dong definitely wouldn’t be. “Senior sister Ma, how could you say that Yuhao played tricks? Wasn’t what he did for the sake of letting the academy win?”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao smiled in response, but didn’t say anything. She just looked ambiguously towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan waved his hand and motioned for everyone to keep quiet. He then continued, “During these past two days, I’ve carefully examined the matches between the other academies. This first elimination round can only be described as ‘fierce’. None of the other academies won as easily as we did. Even the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy struggled a bit with their opponents; it took them around ten minutes to conclude their battle. This means that we’ll definitely have enough time to conserve and strengthen our energy. The round-robin phase of the tournament will begin tomorrow. In fact, the list matchups for the round-robin is already out. It seems to have been compiled based on the order of the teams that passed this elimination round. My next objective is to come up with a plan for tomorrow’s match.”</p>
 <p>After their experience with the Hand of Death and having heard his instructions before the first match of the tournament, even the three students from the inner courtyard had completely accepted Wang Yan as the leading teacher of the team.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan said, “Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao are all my students, as such I know quite a bit about their abilities. However, I don’t know too much about you four. I hope that you all can tell me about your soul skills, as it will have an impact on the plan that I’m going to arrange for the match.”</p>
 <p>Normally, soul skills were a soul master’s biggest secret. However, the situation wasn’t the same inside the academy, let alone now that they were on the eve of an important match. Therefore, it was normal for Wang Yan to ask this question.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei nodded and went first in order to set an example as their team leader. He said in a grave tone, “I have a total of four soul skills: Thunderous Dragon Claw, Vigorous Thunderbolt, Thunderous Fury, and Thunderous Dragon Head.”</p>
 <p>Afterwards, he carefully explained both the characteristics of his soul skills and their usage. Then, it was Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan’s turn.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi was considered the number one student in the outer courtyard alongside Bei Bei, and his four soul skills broadened everyone’s horizons. As for Jiang Nannan, her soul skills were also quite good. In particular, if she were to use them in a one-on-one fight, they would surely leave a deep impression on her opponents.</p>
 <p>At last, it was He Caitou’s turn. He was also a Soul Ancestor like the others.</p>
 <p>“Caitou, considering the fact that you’re a soul engineer, there would usually be no need to inquire about your soul skills. However… the current situation is a bit special. We have to make use of everything at our disposition. If possible, could you please tell us about your martial soul?” Wang Yan asked He Caitou.</p>
 <p>He Caitou nodded, but he had an embarrassed expression on his face as he said, “Actually, even my martial soul has a certain use. But I’m sure that none of you will be willing to use it. That’s why I didn’t bother to show it.”</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao heard these words, he suddenly recalled the time when he’d seen He Caitou with a long and black object in his mouth. His expression immediately became somewhat strange.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan smiled and said, “It’s alright, everything has its use. Come on, let us see your unique martial soul.”</p>
 <p>He Caitou looked around and, lacking self-confidence, said, “You aren’t allowed to laugh.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao nodded seriously and replied, “Fine. We won’t laugh at you. Now quick, don't waste anymore time. Come on and show us this soul skill of yours.”</p>
 <p>He Caitou dark face blushed as he said, “This daddy has a thick cigar.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was dumbfounded, and she immediately got angry. “What did you just say?”</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t even have the chance to release her anger, when four soul rings, two yellow and two purple, suddenly appeared from beneath He Caitou’s body. His first soul ring lit up, and that black and long thing that Huo Yuhao had once seen reappeared in Caitou’s hand...</p>
 <p>The room immediately went quiet. He Caitou looked around, and—save for Huo Yuhao—everyone was dumbfounded. He quickly remarked, “You’re not allowed to laugh! You promised that you wouldn’t!”</p>
 <p>“Pfff—” The entire room immediately exploded into laughter. Everyone began to laugh; even Wang Yan was no exception.</p>
 <p>Yes, it was indeed truly unique! He Caitou’s martial soul was unique to the point that no one had expected it.</p>
 <p>They laughed so hard that the sound could even be heard in the corridor outside. Their laughter happened to be heard by the leader of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s main team, Ma Rulong, who happened to be passing through the corridor. His expression immediately changed when he heard them. Why were these guys from Shrek Academy laughing so hard? The round-robin would began tomorrow!</p>
 <p>He Caitou became angry from the shame he felt. He struck back fiercely by immediately stuffing the long cigar he was holding into Xu Sanshi’s wide open mouth.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi’s smiling face immediately stiffened. Then, a burst of flames appeared out of nowhere on the tips of He Caitou’s fingers that were holding the game, which ignited the other end of the cigar...</p>
