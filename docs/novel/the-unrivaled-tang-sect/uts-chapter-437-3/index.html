After hearing these few words, the middle-aged Soul King and the soul masters under him were all moved. Shrek Academy was a holy ground to soul masters! It was the dream of many young soul masters to be educated at Shrek Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re from Shrek Academy? Do you have any proof?” The Soul King’s expression softened somewhat. He took a few steps forward, but the rest of the soul masters had yet to move, continuing to surround the few of them. They were highly-trained, and wouldn’t be easily swayed by Huo Yuhao’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and retrieved the letter that Elder Xuan had given to him. He said, “This is a letter written by the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion, Elder Xuan, to the White Tiger Duke. Can you bring us to meet the White Tiger Duke? Oh right, I’m also classmates with the son of the White Tiger Duke, Dai Yueheng. He can also verify my identity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t pass the letter over, even though he was holding onto it. A Soul King who was in charge of patrolling the area naturally wasn’t qualified to read the letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hesitated for a moment before saying, “Alright, follow me then.” After he finished speaking, he turned around quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gestured and led his teammates along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other nine soul masters of the small team separated to open a path for them. It was only after they had all passed that these soul masters turned around and followed them, watching their movements closely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul King only waited for Huo Yuhao to catch up with him before walking side by side with him. He didn’t have any psychological pressure bringing the eight of them back to the base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There are thousands of soul masters stationed at the frontline camp, and they’re all very strong. How can these eight possibly affect them? Furthermore, these young chaps have to go through many obstacles before they can meet the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From a distance, they could see the Northwestern Field Army. The view was majestic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

The leader of the small team verified his identity before the soldier returned to his post.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a minute. I’ll go and report this matter. Later, there’ll be some people coming to bring all of you in. This letter…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “I’m sorry, but I have to personally pass this letter to the White Tiger Duke. Otherwise, you can also ask senior Dai Yueheng to pass it to his father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, please wait then.” The Soul King didn’t continue to pose problems, but instead instructed his own team members to wait before he quickly entered the camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he didn’t think that Huo Yuhao and the others could do anything, he didn’t dare to delay matters concerning Shrek Academy. He needed to report this matter to the top brass immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very quickly, more than ten people came out from the camp, though Huo Yuhao only knew the person leading this group of people. This person wasn’t Dai Yueheng, but the princess of the Star Luo Empire, Xu Jiujiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Princess Jiujiu is personally here to receive us? This is a little too much. Even though she’s not the main decision-maker in the military, she’s still a member of the imperial family. Furthermore, she has real power in the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Princess Jiujiu saw Huo Yuhao, she was also stunned, and more than a little surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At first, the Soul King didn’t think a bunch of young soul masters could do anything. However, Princess Jiujiu begged to differ. She had personally witnessed the miracles that Huo Yuhao had performed before! In addition, Huo Yuhao’s reputation had grown significantly following the appearance of the Spirit Pagoda. There weren’t many people who knew him personally, but many people knew his name. For those soul masters who were more resourceful and aware in the Douluo Continent, they most certainly knew of his existence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu was also followed by soul masters. Two of them were elders, and one of the elders was the Big Dipper Douluo. The other elder who was with the Big Dipper Douluo was obviously a Titled Douluo as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu had been in a bad mood these past few days. Ever since her mistake led to the death of many high-tier soul masters, she passed all authority over the soul masters to the White Tiger Duke. Whether it was her or the current Star Luo Empire’s Emperor, they trusted the White Tiger Duke greatly. They knew that Dai Hao wouldn’t do anything against the empire, even if he was given great authority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, who didn’t want to earn merits? Xu Jiujiu had a deep desire for power, which was why she had always expressed her wish to control a soul engineer legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, reality proved that she was inexperienced on a battlefield. The huge losses had made her doubt herself, and she had no choice but to pass all her power over to the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had been very reclusive over the past few days. She hardly gave any suggestions, even though she participated in every meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her presence today was a coincidence. The officer of the small team that Huo Yuhao and the others had bumped into was under Xu Jiujiu’s command. She was immediately notified of the arrival of people from Shrek Academy, given that it was extremely important information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was startled when she heard the words “Shrek Academy”, and immediately delighted. Even though she heard that there were only a few young people, she wasn’t affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the past few years, the Star Luo Empire had been doing its best to build up a good relationship with Shrek, with the goal of receiving the support of Shrek Academy at critical times. Given that youngsters from Shrek Academy had arrived, didn’t it mean that the more experienced and stronger ones were also coming?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the younger soul masters from Shrek Academy were different from young soul masters in the outside world. There were many talents in Shrek Academy. For example, Zhang Lexuan was only slightly past thirty years of age, but she was already on the edge of becoming a Titled Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, Xu Jiujiu controlled the intelligence department of the Star Luo Empire, and was clearly aware of the resources pumped into soul tools by Shrek Academy in recent years. With the arrival of reinforcements from Shrek Academy, they would receive massive help, even though it wasn’t enough to completely alter the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, she didn’t dare to delay, even given her status, and went out to welcome them personally. She had seen all the younger generation’s talents from Shrek Academy. In addition, she even brought two Titled Douluo out with her. Even if there were any changes, they would be well-equipped to handle them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these two Titled Douluo and the other soul masters from the Star Luo Empire, who all had at least seven rings, saw Xu Jiujiu quickening her pace, they were all stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While those people are from Shrek Academy, aren’t they all just youngsters? Why is Her Highness…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao, it’s actually you!” Xu Jiujiu’s words astonished all the soul masters from the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao! Hearing this name shocked them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t just lead Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect to successive victories in the Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament; his establishment of the Spirit Pagoda also made him an extremely notable figure in the world of soul masters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he had emerged as the champion in the Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament twice, that was only a big thing among the younger generation of soul masters. The existence of Spirits affected the entire world of soul masters! It might even influence the bigger picture in the future world of soul masters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various soul masters quickened their footsteps to keep up with Xu Jiujiu. They wanted to get a glimpse of the person who had established the Spirit Pagoda!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness.” Huo Yuhao quickly took a few steps forward and greeted Xu Jiujiu. He smiled at her and nodded slightly to acknowledge her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was from the Star Luo Empire, he was a member of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Even in the face of a princess, he wouldn’t greet her in an extravagant manner. That was just how powerful Shrek Academy was.</span></p>
