 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black light looked as gentle as ripples on water. It entangled with the Light of Annihilation that came from behind him. The moment the Light of Annihilation entered the black light, it started to ripple intensely. However, every single black ripple continued to twist and turn, stopping every single strand of Light of Annihilation from entering it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another black light flashed, and a huge shield appeared, blocking Ye Guyi, who came down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The shield was completely black. On it, one could see the carving of a huge, deep-blue turtle. On the back of the turtle was a small, coiled blood-red snake with jade-green eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the shield appeared, the entire Sparring Arena was covered by a layer of black ripples. It was like this entire area had turned into the bottom of a lake. Both Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu felt discomfort, as if they were stuck in mud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, this was the Xuanwu Shield, the complete form of the Xuanwu Shield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who benefited the most in the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley? It was definitely not those whose soul power had increased, but Xu Sanshi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the valley, he had resolved his relationship issue with Jiang Nannan, and the two of them were finally together. Furthermore, he had experienced that scene once more, and this time, his Xuanwu Shield was fully awoken. Now, he had a martial soul which descended from a pure, ancient bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among Shrek’s Seven Monsters, Bei Bei was no longer the strongest. Xu Sanshi, who now wielded his pure Xuanwu Shield, was the strongest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he unleashed his Xuanwu Shield, Xu Sanshi appeared to have increased in size. Countless black ripples pulsed from his body. Xu Sanshi took a step forward, and his Xuanwu Shield doubled in size once more. A powerful energy could be felt from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black light filled the entire Sparring Arena. The black ripples instantly turned into countless rising dots of black light. It was like a plate filled with water, which someone had just hit from underneath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

The two girls felt that the soul power they had used to launch their attacks had been instantly destroyed by this powerful energy. In shock, they retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, black ripples appeared once again. The vibrations made their movements sluggish. The movements of the two girls became visibly slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, continue to work hard. After Qiuqiu gets her sixth ring, you can consider looking for me,” Xu Sanshi chuckled as he waved his hands at the two girls. The surrounding black light became even more intense, forcing the two girls to go on the defensive. However, the moment the black light receded, Xu Sanshi had already disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s… he’s so strong,” Nan Qiuqiu said in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His martial soul is very powerful,” Ye Guyi said with a heavy expression on her face. “While it’s water-type, it had the thickness of a soil-type martial soul. Furthermore, I feel that his martial soul is not on the same level as ours. I estimate that he’s around Rank 68, very close to Rank 70.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu exclaimed in shock, “So our Tang Sect will soon have a second Soul Sage?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi nodded and said, “In the past, he didn’t seem so strong. In the past two months, however, he has become very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi heard the two girls’ conversation clearly, and could not help but laugh. He was delighted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi was right. Right now, his soul power was at Rank 68.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soul power did not increase in the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley. However, after his martial soul turned completely into the Xuanwu, his cultivation entered a strange state. It was like a form of refinement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The refinement of his martial soul caused his own soul power to become refined as well. His past two months of cultivation had allowed his soul power to change completely. Over the past two months, his evolved martial soul was able to complete its fusion, and his soul power naturally rose to Rank 68. Xu Sanshi estimated that in less than half a year, he had a chance of surpassing Rank 70. With the strength of his martial soul, the Xuanwu Shield, he would not even fear Rank 80 Soul Douluo once he hit Rank 70!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was not the only one who had improved. Through the Continental Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament, everyone from the Tang Sect who had participated benefited greatly from it. Their fights in the tournament and their struggles in the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley had allowed them to reap many benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao, under Dean Yan Shaozhe’s personal supervision, had successfully retrieved their sixth soul rings. They reached the rank of Soul Emperor, improving the Tang Sect even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu both had great potential. The reason why they were unable to fight those from the Tang Sect was because of their foundations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy was not known as the top Academy in the world for nothing. Its method of education was excellent, and reigned supreme. In particular, they were able to produce the best soul masters, who no one else could beat. Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi were both now on the path that Shrek’s Seven Monsters trod. Their shaky foundations, after the intensity of the past few months, solidified. Soon, they would improve faster and faster. With excellent instruction from good teachers, and Shrek’s Seven Monsters as their peers, their cultivation had been improving rapidly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third elder brother,” a clear voice suddenly called out..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes? Xu Sanshi replied without thinking. In the Tang Sect, other than Bei Bei, He Caitou, Xuan Ziwen, and a few others, almost everyone else called him that. He was thinking about the overall strength of everyone from the Tang Sect, so he did not pay much attention to the voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s spar,” said the voice once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure. Wait!” Xu Sanshi finally woke up from his reverie. He raised his head to look.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who wants to spar with me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw a smiling, confident youth, his eyes opened wide in shock. Then, brimming with joy, he shot forward like an arrow to hug him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You rascal! You finally ended your closed-door cultivation,” Xu Sanshi said excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right! I’m done. I took a shower and changed. Just when I walked out, I saw a good show. Third elder brother, your power has improved so much! I almost didn’t recognize you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi chuckled and said, “Don’t try and flatter me. Eh, what’s this? You can walk again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who had appeared in front Xu Sanshi, who delighted him so much, was none other than Huo Yuhao, who was ranked number six among Shrek’s Seven Monsters. His closed-door cultivation had indeed made everyone worry deeply for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lifted his right leg and kicked out. He nodded at Xu Sanshi and said, “That’s right, I’ve healed fully. All of my passageways are clear once more. I’ve absorbed all the energy into my body.” As he said that, his eyes shone with a faint light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Xu Sanshi’s sight was not as good as Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes, it was not weak either. He saw the instantaneous change in his junior’s eyes. To his shock, Huo Yuhao’s eyes shone with a pale white light. It was not as powerful or dazzling as his original golden eyes. Instead, it looked as clear and silky as jade. His entire body appeared to be holding in great power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little junior brother, you’ve changed!” After Wang Dong’er was revealed to be a girl, Huo Yuhao was naturally the youngest male disciple.
