 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spiritual Detection and sensed Tang Ya’s pulse as well as her physical condition. After pondering for a brief moment, he said, “Around an hour. Allow Teacher Xiao Ya’s bodily functions to slowly recover under the stimulation of life energy. In this way, she’ll be able to live longer. As long as we find the Bluesilver Emperor in the meantime and summon Tang Ya’s martial soul, as well as her original life energy, we’ll be able to treat her. When we pour in life energy then, it won’t disappear. She’ll be able to produce her own life energy too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Huo Yuhao’s explanation, Bei Bei felt more relieved. After the first round of detoxification, Xiao Ya’s condition wasn’t going to worsen anymore. What he had to do now was locate the Bluesilver Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Eldest senior, I suddenly thought of an idea. Listen to it and see whether it’s feasible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Bei Bei’s eyes brightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Due to the Sun Moon Empire’s invasion and the expansion of Shrek City, Shrek City is currently the safest place on the continent. At least this is what everyone from the three empires in the original Douluo Continent thinks. In Shrek City, there are powers from every empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Over the years, the Tang Sect has slowly grown in name. In my opinion, we should announce a mission to locate the Bluesilver Emperor. Whoever can provide reliable information and helps us to locate the Bluesilver Emperor will be owed a favor under the sect’s name, as long as whatever he wants us to do isn’t morally wrong. Or, we can repay him by giving him a batch of soul tools. After all, we are limited on our own. However, if we can tap into the strength of the entire Douluo Continent, we’ll be more able to find the Bluesilver Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Huo Yuhao’s words, Bei Bei was slightly stunned. After that, he furrowed his brow and said, “No, we can’t do that. We can’t place such a huge burden on the sect because of Xiao Ya. We won’t know what whoever helps us will want. I can’t bring so much trouble to the sect because of me and Tang Ya. Even if we have to repay someone, it should be under my name.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head in reply. “No, eldest senior. You are not persuasive enough. I’m afraid that you don’t want to hear this. No matter who it is, our individual abilities can’t convince entire empires to help us search for something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, the Tang Sect is different. Right now, the three empires of the original Douluo Continent have used the soul tools that we’ve produced. They also know of our close relationship with the Academy. Given this, we’ll be able to attract their attention once we announce this mission. From there, they’ll help us to find the Bluesilver Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei sighed and said, “Yuhao, I recognize your good intentions. However, we can’t do this. It took very long for the Tang Sect to achieve what it has today. We can’t do this for Xiao Ya…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why not? We think it’s workable,” Jiang Nannan suddenly interrupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nannan…” Bei Bei lifted his head to look at Jiang Nannan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan looked very determined. “Bei Bei, do you still remember why we joined the Tang Sect? We didn’t aim to own such a strong sect. We are teammates and friends. Honestly, Xiao Ya is the real sect leader of the Tang Sect. You are only acting on her behalf and assuming her authority because she hasn’t been around. Now that our real sect leader is in trouble, shouldn’t we do our best to help her?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, it’s not just her. No matter who faces such trouble in the sect, we’ll do everything we can to save him or her. It’s only this way that we can demonstrate how united the Tang Sect is, so that every disciple of the sect is willing to do his best for the sect, and treats the sect as his family. I think Yuhao’s idea is workable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Jiang Nannan’s words, Bei Bei went silent. Right now, he only felt a warm flow in his chest. All these years, he had been living in pain because of Xiao Ya’s disappearance. He had placed all of his energy into his cultivation and developing the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Jiang Nannan’s words didn’t just bring him warmth. They made him feel a sense of kinship, especially when she talked about the unity of the Tang Sect.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right, the Tang Sect is very united!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan turned her head after seeing Bei Bei lower his, and said to Huo Yuhao, “Yuhao, it’s set. After we return, we’ll announce this mission. I believe that there will be interested parties.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Huo Yuhao immediately agreed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei let out a long breath and nodded gently, saying, “Thanks. I’m thanking all of you on behalf of Xiao Ya.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao laughed, “Eldest senior, why are you thanking all of us on behalf of Teacher Xiao Ya? We’re all friends! This is what we should be doing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this plan, Bei Bei was instantly in a better mood. If they were unable to find the Bluesilver Emperor, even with the strength of the entire Douluo Continent, Tang Ya’s fate might indeed be sealed...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded and said, “I also believe that Yuhao’s plan is workable. Tang Ya is indeed the only heir to the Tang Sect. The Sect and Shrek Academy possess thousands of years of ties. I believe the Academy will support the Sect in this matter. However, please forgive the Academy, because we can’t use our name, given our involvements in many areas. However, the Academy will try its best to help no matter what conditions the person who finds the Bluesilver Emperor requests.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks, Elder Song,” Bei Bei said gratefully. Elder Song held a very important position in the Sea God’s Pavilion, only inferior to Elder Xuan. With Elder Song’s support, it was almost a guarantee that Dean Xian Lin’er and Qian Duoduo would also express their support. In addition, along with Huo Yuhao, Bei Bei, and Elder Song’s votes, they already had five votes in the Sea God’s Pavilion, close to half the total votes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things temporarily settled down in the demiplane. The mission this time had been successfully completed. Not only did they manage to save Tang Ya, they even used a Class 9 stationary shell to destroy an entire soul engineer legion of the Sun Moon Empire. This alleviated some of the pressure on the Heavenly Soul Empire at the front line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was only possible because the shell was detonated inside the Sun Moon Empire’s base. If not for Nangong Wan, they wouldn’t have accomplished this. Although the Sun Moon Empire’s army still seemed to be very disciplined, they were already facing internal chaos. Investigations were underway, causing great disruptions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire was delightfully surprised by this. Although their surveillance was limited, they naturally knew about what had happened, given the great uproar that had ensued because of the Class 9 stationary shell. It was so powerful that its effects could be clearly witnessed even from tens of kilometers away. They were already informed in detail of where the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions were by Huo Yuhao’s surveillance, and so could piece the puzzle together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for the fact that Wei Na was leading the Heavenly Soul Empire’s army then, and took the initiative to carry on with the original plan, they might actually have turned the act into a real show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of this matter, the marshals of the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires were very displeased. They thought that the Heavenly Soul Empire was too conservative, and hadn’t exploited such a great opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, the Heavenly Soul Empire had their own difficulties. Naturally, they knew that this was a great opportunity. However, the Sun Moon Empire didn’t seem to be in a bad state. Also, the armies that were gathered were already all the remaining forces that the Heavenly Soul Empire had. Once the fight fully broke out, they couldn’t possibly let the Dou Ling and Star Luo Empires lead the lines, they had to be the first to act. When that happened, they were bound to suffer heavy losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They might not even win this fight. Even if they did, it would be a hard-fought and tragic victory. Even if the Sun Moon Empire was forced back temporarily, what if they came back again? If the Heavenly Soul Empire sustained great casualties, how could they possibly revive their empire? Even if they could, they wouldn’t be able to protect it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire posed a great threat. However, if the Heavenly Soul Empire weakened to a certain point, and the Sun Moon Empire’s threat also fell, the Star Luo Empire and Dou Ling Empires might actually be able to threaten the Heavenly Soul Empire. As a result, given such a conflict of interests, the Heavenly Soul Empire still decided to follow their original plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The facts proved that their decision was right. Although the Sun Moon Empire suffered heavy losses, they weren’t on the brink of collapse. If there really was a fight, no one knew who would prevail. No matter what, the Heavenly Soul Empire was bound to sustain heavy losses as the aggressors. They had to breach the other four soul formations that the Sun Moon Empire had set up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the incident, there was a great uproar in the Sun Moon Empire. The loss of a soul engineer legion seemed to have caused Lin Hai to age overnight. He was the only one to shoulder this responsibility. Furthermore, the Holy Ghost Church had also sustained heavy losses. One of their elders was dead, one of their Holy Ladies had disappeared, and many evil soul masters had been killed. This responsibility was definitely not going to be shouldered by Zhongli Wu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were widespread investigations going on in the Sun Moon Empire’s base. However, three days had passed, and it still seemed like those from Shrek had vanished into thin air. There were no clues to their whereabouts at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing that Zhongli Wu felt was fortunate was that Nangong Wan, the Third Elder, and the Fourth Elder all survived, even though they had sustained critical injuries. The life energy of a Titled Douluo was very strong. After a certain period of recuperation, they would be able to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">--------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night of the fourth day...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black crack silently appeared inside a pitch-black tent. A figure silently appeared out of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was very quiet in this tent, where the Masquerade Douluo had stayed before he died.
