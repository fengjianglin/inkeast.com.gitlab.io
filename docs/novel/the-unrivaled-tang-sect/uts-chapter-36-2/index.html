 <p><strong>Book 6: Graduating</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 36.2: The Awakened Gray Color&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Amidst the loud laughter, the gray light within Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sea receded like a tide. After a few seconds, everything around him had returned to normal, and the gray pearl had returned to its original position.</p>
 <p>“My hand grasps the sun and moon and plucks the stars from the sky; this world has no one else like me.” Muttering these domineering yet somewhat sorrowful words, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but be left stunned for a moment.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm cursed in rage, “Bastard, bastard! That old fella actually dared to ignore this Brother. He even cursed at me! I want to kill him, I really want to kill him!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was jolted by the Skydream Iceworm’s voice, and said somewhat helplessly, “Brother Skydream, you should calm down a bit. That old mister didn’t seem to have any evil intentions.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm unhappily replied, “What do you mean ‘no evil intentions’? Weren’t you listening when he said that he wanted to crush me to death? This won’t do. Yuhao, you have to quickly raise your strength. He’s a parasite in your Spiritual Sea, thus only you can drive him out using your spiritual power. Even though his divine sense is at an extremely high level, he can’t hurt you since he’s a foreign object in your Spiritual Sea. Once your divine sense reaches his level, you’ll be able to easily deal with him.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was somewhat helpless. “Brother Skydream, you just said that his divine sense was at a very high level. How long do you think I’ll have to cultivate in order to reach his level?”</p>
 <p>“This… let me make a few calculations.” The Skydream Iceworm fell silent.</p>
 <p>Right now, Huo Yuhao was extremely curious. The fact that an intelligent soul ring was in his body already allowed him to stand out from the masses, but he hadn’t expected to absorb a strand of divine sense when he’d fused with the Skydream Iceworm. This was his Spiritual Sea, and though he was far inferior to the Skydream Iceworm and the old man, he’d clearly been able to sense everything going on in here. When that old man had spoken to him, he’d been able to sense the vicissitudes and sincerity in his voice. From that, he’d been able to tell that he truly had no intention of harming him. Furthermore, that strand of divine sense was extremely weak, so much so that it was even weaker than his spiritual power.</p>
 <p>However, was he truly as weak as he’d seemed? Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but think of everything that had just occurred. That seemingly-weak gray divine sense had taken control of his soul power, then activated the attack that had defeated Wu Feng. Even though it had been a Spiritual Shock, the gray light had been able to condense his spiritual power into something the thickness the strand of a piece of hair, which in turn had pierced through all of Wang Yan’s defenses and defeated her without actually harming her. Was this level of control something that he was able to compare to?</p>
 <p>If he possessed this level of control over his spiritual power, the strength of his spiritual-type soul skills would increase, as would the level of his soul power fusion with Wang Dong—to the point that it’d even be slightly excessive!</p>
 <p>This was true control. However, how could he increase his level of control over his spiritual power?</p>
 <p>“Aih…” The Skydream Iceworm let out a long sigh, “I’ve done a quick estimation. With your current cultivation speed, even if I were to wholeheartedly help you out, you’d still need around three thousand years for your divine sense to catch up to his.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Even though Huo Yuhao already a high estimation of the nameless old man, he’d mostly been trying to pacify the Skydream Iceworm when he’d said that he wasn’t as good as the old man. However, he never expected the Skydream Iceworm, who resented the old man, to give him an answer like this. As he wasn’t on good terms with the old man, it definitely couldn’t be a lie!</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm was extremely helpless. “Why else would I be powerless to do anything to a mere strand of divine sense? I don’t know where that old fella came from, but his divine sense is on a much higher level than mine. He’s very weak now, but the level of his divine sense has already reached a level I’m incapable of comprehending. He’s already surpassed the level of all living beings on this continent. It truly seems like I can’t do anything to him! Only, I don’t know whether he’ll have any combat strength once he’s recovered. We’ll see, but he shouldn’t have any. His divine sense is this weak now, thus even if he does repair it, it’s still just a strand.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao murmured, “Then, how strong was this old mister before his divine sense shattered?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm sulkily replied, “A level that you can’t even begin to fathom right now.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Brother Skydream, this old man has no evil intentions, and we can’t do anything to him anyway. Since that’s the case, why don’t we all just live together peacefully?”</p>
 <p>“Hmph!” The Skydream Iceworm snorted angrily, clearly unhappy.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“You’ve made a mistake; his Body Soul hasn’t had a second awakening.” Elder Xuan moved his oily hand away from Huo Yuhao’s chest.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan asked suspiciously, “That can’t be. If he didn’t have a second awakening, why did his Spirit Eyes turn gray? Furthermore, I clearly sensed a different aura from him! Even more so, he defeated a two-ringed assault-type soul master. Elder Xuan, why don’t we try it out again once he’s woken up?”</p>
 <p>After sending Wu Feng to the infirmary, Wang Yan had dismissed Class 1. He’d then rushed over to the inner courtyard and found Elder Xuan, then explained the situation of Huo Yuhao’s possible second awakening to him.</p>
 <p>This time around, even Elder Xuan had been left somewhat stunned. One of the many advantages a Body Soul had over other martial souls was its second awakening. A Body Soul that could achieve a second awakening was a peak existence among Body Souls. Moreover, a Body Soul that achieved a second awakening would immediately reach a new level. Because of this, he’d hastily followed Wang Yan to Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s dormitory in order to see Huo Yuhao’s condition for himself.</p>
 <p>Somewhat impatient, Elder Xuan replied, “There’s no need to bother. Little Wang! I know you’ve been studying Body Souls, but you can’t be content with such a shallow understanding. Do you even know what happens when a Body Soul achieves its second awakening? He hasn’t even reached the most basic level of a second awakening. His soul power is still Rank 17, meaning that it hasn’t changed at all. If he’d truly had a second awakening, his soul power would’ve reached the bottleneck of Rank 20 at the very least. This kid can be considered to be quite talented, but he’s still too old. He won’t reach Rank 30 by the age of twelve, so there’s still a gap between him and the most outstanding students amongst the freshmen. In the future, don’t waste my time with him.” With that, he drank a mouthful of wine and left.</p>
 <p>With a downcast look on his face, Wang Yan told Wang Dong to take care of Huo Yuhao, then proceeded to leave as well.</p>
 <p>It was already late into the night when Huo Yuhao awoke. The pain in his body had already diminished by a large amount. Moreover, Wang Yan had also brought some healing medicine over. His injuries weren’t light, but his bones and internal organs hadn’t been injured. With the help of Shrek Academy’s top-ranked medicines, his injuries weren’t much of a problem.</p>
 <p>What a soft and warm feeling. To his astonishment, Huo Yuhao discovered that he was sleeping soundly atop Wang Dong’s bed. On the other hand, Wang Dong was soundly asleep with his upper body leaning on the bed.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t the first time that Huo Yuhao had been on Wang Dong’s bed, but it was the first time he’d slept there.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was greatly touched by Wang Dong's actions. He clearly understood how mysophobic Wang Dong was. Normally, Wang Dong wouldn't even let him sit atop his bed. Yet, he'd actually allowed him to sleep on his bed, despite his body being covered in dust from the Soul Duel.</p>
 <p>After quietly getting up from the bed, he carefully picked Wang Dong up and placed him on the bed. Turning his head, he glanced towards his wooden bed that didn’t even have a mattress. He gently placed Wang Dong on the fur-coated mattress and shuffled him around before lying down next to him.</p>
 <p>The two of them were slightly cramped, being together on the same bed, but they were still kids. They weren’t as fat as Xie Huanyue, so squeezing together was still possible, though only barely.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao then pulled the cover over both of them. With a warm feeling in his heart, he fell asleep again. It had been a long time since he’d had such a relaxing night of sleep without cultivating. At that moment, he completely relaxed from the various emotions he’d experienced during the day.</p>
 <p>Morning. The sky outside slowly brightened.</p>
 <p>As Wang Dong slowly woke up from his sleep, he slowly came back to his senses with his eyes still closed. <em>How comfortable! What a nice sleep I had.</em></p>
 <p><em>After being dragged along by that fella to cultivate every night, it’s been such a long time since I’ve had such a nice night of sleep. It feels so nice to snuggle this warm and cozy pillow, and to sleep so soundly. Holding this pillow is so warm. Nice... Nice….</em></p>
 <p>Filled with contentment, Wang Dong nearly fell back asleep. Suddenly, his mind shook, remembering something.</p>
 <p><em>That’s not right! Huo Yuhao was injured yesterday, so I should’ve been taking care of him! How did I manage to sleep so comfortably?</em></p>
 <p>Remembering the injured Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong immediately woke up and opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>The first thing he saw was the shape of a face. Soundly asleep, Huo Yuhao's cheeks were ruddy under the morning sunlight. A strong aura of warmth slowly emanated off of him.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was thoroughly stunned. He discovered that his head was currently leaning against that person’s shoulder. His arm, on the other hand, was latched onto his chest, and it was even gripped tightly. His thigh was over that person’s leg, and he’d even hooked his heel onto his outer thigh in order to prevent himself from falling.</p>
 <p>This, was this a body pillow?</p>
 <p>His mind turned blank. Three, two, one...</p>
 <p>“AH—” An ear-piercing screech suddenly rang out through the first year dorms.</p>
 <p>This screech was simply too loud. Even though the dorm rooms had extremely good soundproofing, it instantly jolted a large amount of first years who were cultivating or sleeping awake.</p>
 <p>“Aiyah, you’re gonna make me fall to death.”</p>
 <p>Humans were always defenseless when they were asleep, and Huo Yuhao was no exception to this. He’d been sleeping very soundly, and he’d only felt a warm, soft ‘pillow’ that released a fresh odor sticking to him. With the soft yet thick fur-coated mattress he’d slept on, he’d slept very soundly. Normally, he’d already be awake in order to cultivate the Purple Demon Eyes. However, he’d slept especially soundly today.</p>
