<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><strong>Book 1: Skydream Iceworm</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 4.1:&nbsp;'Thunderbolt' Bei Bei</strong></p>
 <p>Bei Bei spoke with slight astonishment, “Little brother Huo, you definitely need to think about this carefully. Joining a sect is not a small matter. Even though our Tang Sect is already on the decline, when all is said and done, we were still once the number one sect under the heavens. If you regret your decision in the future, and wish to betray the sect, no matter whether it is Tang Ya or myself, neither of us will forgive you. ”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Big brother Bei, I’ve already thought this matter through carefully. I no longer have any relatives, and am of a young age as well. I only learned how dangerous the outside world was after coming to the Great Star Dou Forest this time around. I want to become an outstanding individual and a powerful Soul Master. Joining the Tang Sect is no doubt a shortcut for me to achieve that. Not only does joining the Tang Sect let me enter Shrek Academy, I can furthermore receive guidance from the both of you. Moreover, I believe in the both of you. The two of you were willing to tell me of the predicaments the Tang Sect is currently facing. I can thus feel the sincerity that the both of you hold towards me. I’m willing to help the Tang Sect regain its glory together with the both of you.”</p>
 <p>“Good, you couldn’t have said it any better.” Tang Ya took hold of Huo Yuhao, and embraced him in excitement.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei also nodded slightly as he looked at Huo Yuhao, as if he felt the same way too. Huo Yuhao was much more mature than his peers of the same age. Although he’d only obtained his first soul ring after he was over ten years old, and even though talent was important, hard work was absolutely necessary, let alone the fact that he was a rarely-seen owner of a spiritual-type body soul. It could be said that the Tang Sect had gotten him for a cheap price.</p>
 <p>The faint fragrance on Tang Ya’s body caused Huo Yuhao’s face to immediately turn red. He didn’t dare to move at all, he just stood there innocently.</p>
 <p>It was Bei Bei who again helped him out of this embarrassing situation, “Teacher Xiao Ya.”</p>
 <p>Only now did Tang Ya loosen her embrace on Huo Yuhao’s arm. She smiled at him, and looking at her appearance, she was extremely pleased. Obviously, though she absolutely wouldn’t admit it, the very first reason that she’d wanted Huo Yuhao to join the Tang Sect was because of the excessively delicious roasted fish that he made...</p>
 <p>“Little Yuhao, you should formally become my apprentice now. Our Tang Sect only has three people as of now, and we don’t have that many rules. Once you become my apprentice and call me your teacher, you’ll be a member of our Tang Sect in the future.” Tang Ya said firmly.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded and kneeled down in front of Tang Ya with a ‘putong’ sound. He then paid his respects to her, “Disciple Huo Yuhao greets teacher.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya stood there, unmoving. After letting him pay his respects three times, she helped him up.</p>
 <p>Note: Paying his respects, for those that don’t know, means knocking his head to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Very good, Yuhao. In the future, you’re teacher’s second disciple. Acknowledge your eldest senior brother.” As she spoke, she pointed towards Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>“I acknowledge eldest senior brother.” Huo Yuhao bowed again, this time towards Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei smiled slightly and said, “You don’t have to be so polite, junior brother. We’ll be family in the future.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya seemed to relax as she said, “Yuhao, you should be like Bei Bei, and refer to me as Teacher Xiao Ya in the future. However, don’t learn to be as cheeky as him, understand?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, teacher.” After paying his respects, Huo Yuhao had clearly become slightly reserved. However, the blankness in his heart had stabilised a lot. Joining the Tang Sect had caused a sense of security to imperceptibly appear in his heart. This feeling hadn’t appeared in his heart in a very long time.</p>
 <p>Xiao Ya flipped her wrist over, and pulled out a book from somewhere. She then passed it to Huo Yuhao, “Little Yuhao, this is a copy of our Tang Sect’s Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record; our Tang Sect’s secret techniques are recorded inside. Out of them, the Mysterious Heaven Technique is the foundation to all of the other techniques contained within. If you use it to meditate, it will definitely increase your cultivation speed. Your cultivation is still shallow, so changing your cultivation technique to the Mysterious Heaven Technique won’t have any side effects. Later on, Bei Bei and I will guide you in cultivation. Besides the Mysterious Heaven Technique, the Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record also has five more secret techniques. They are, respectively: Mysterious Jade Hands, which is for training one’s hands; Purple Demon Eyes, which is for train one’s eyes; Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, which is a capturing technique; Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks, which is a speed-type technique, and Hidden Weapon Hundred Separation, which is a method to use hidden weapons. The most famous techniques of our Tang Sect involve our hidden weapons, but you need to establish a good foundation before you can cultivate in them. What you need to do now is begin cultivating in the first five secret techniques. In the future, I’ll teach you how to use hidden weapons.”</p>
 <p>“Earlier, when I said that our Tang Sect had a secret technique that’d be especially suitable for you, I was referring to the Purple Demon Eyes. The Purple Demon Eyes is a technique to train one’s eyes, and you’ll be able to release an extremely strong spiritual attack after cultivating it to a certain degree. Since your martial soul is the Spirit Eyes, there shouldn’t be a more suitable technique for you than this. You should train in this technique as much as possible.”</p>
 <p>After receiving the Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record that Tang Ya had handed him, Huo Yuhao carefully placed it into the folds of his shirt, “Thanks, teacher. I’ll definitely put in a lot of effort to cultivate these techniques.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei tapped his belt, causing a belt that was black, and embedded with round white jades, to appear in his hands.</p>
 <p>“Junior brother, I’ll give you this imitation of the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges that our Ancestor Tang San once had. Just take it as a meeting present from your eldest senior brother. With it, carrying a few items on you will be much more convenient.”</p>
 <p>Whilst speaking, Bei Bei fastened the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges belt onto Huo Yuhao’s waist, and told him how to use it. As it turned out, the twenty four embedded jades on the belt each had a half-metre wide space that could be used to store various objects. Huo Yuhao only needed to guide his soulforce into the belt to be able to use it. It was a relatively precious soul tool.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s poor talent was reflected by the state of his body, but he was extremely smart. After a few tries, he managed to easily control the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges. However, a lot of his soulforce had been drained while he was learning to control it.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya said, “Little Yuhao, the reason why I followed your eldest senior brother out here was the same as yours; it was to kill a soul beast for its soul ring. Follow us, I’ll take you back to Shrek Academy once I’m done.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Teacher.” Huo Yuhao hurriedly gave a respectful reply.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya giggled and said, “Although you’ve already taken me as your master, you don’t have to be so reserved. Since the Tang Sect only has us three, what’s the point of us being so old-fashioned?”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei unhappily said, “With a teacher like you, it’d be a wonder if your disciples were able to be reserved. It’s getting late, let’s hurry up. Hopefully our luck will be better, and we’ll be able to find and kill a suitable soul beast on the outskirts of the Great Star Dou Forest.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah.” Tang Ya nodded and said, “Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Tang Ya walked in front, while Bei Bei remained behind, pulling Huo Yuhao along by the hand. The three of them sped up simultaneously, and rushed towards the Great Star Dou Forest.</p>
 <p>After obtaining his first soul ring, Huo Yuhao clearly felt that his own cultivation had risen greatly. This was especially so for his body, allowing him to be much more relaxed during the journey. However, his speed was still greatly different compared to Tang Ya and Bei Bei’s. A gentle flow of soulforce flowed out from Bei Bei’s hand into his, practically carrying him along on their journey. On the other hand, Huo Yuhao himself didn’t need to expend much strength.</p>
 <p>While they ran, Bei Bei spoke to Huo Yuhao, “Junior brother, our Tang Sect’s Mysterious Heaven Technique is presently one of the continent’s best cultivation techniques. As long as you cultivate it diligently, you’ll definitely reap some benefits. I’ll tell you the tricks needed to circulate the Mysterious Heaven Technique. You must remember them.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Huo Yuhao nodded his head, and listened to Bei Bei’s explanation seriously.</p>
 <p>Not only was Bei Bei’s outward appearance scholarly, he also had an extremely gentle and meticulous temperament. When he explained the Mysterious Heaven Technique’s cultivation technique to Huo Yuhao, he patiently explained all of the particulars of the technique in detail. When they came across an area that Huo Yuhao didn’t understand, he would give an explanation that was both easy and simple to understand, which caused Huo Yuhao to quickly become immersed in the fantastic technique.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya, who was walking in front, couldn’t help but stick her tongue out, because she was completely certain that she’d be unable to explain things as orderly as Bei Bei was, if she were the one to teach Huo Yuhao. As the sect master of the Tang Sect, she herself was truly unqualified as a teacher.</p>
