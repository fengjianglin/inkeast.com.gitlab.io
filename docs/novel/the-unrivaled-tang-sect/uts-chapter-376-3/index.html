Following this, a dim golden projection rose from Huo Yuhao’s body. As golden lights flashed, her Grudge in the air was crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah, interesting.” She drifted to the ground and didn’t continue attacking. She stared at Huo Yuhao with a strange look in her bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spiritual-type soul master? Very rare. Your spiritual cultivation has long surpassed your actual cultivation.” She seemed to become like a normal person right now, apart from her looks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “That’s right. You must be a spiritual-type soul master too. However, the paths that we are taking are evidently different. Your martial soul should be an Avenging Spirit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehehehehehe…” She let out a shrilling laugh, which was filled with hysteria and sarcasm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Avenging Spirit? Is my martial soul an Avenging Spirit? No, you are wrong. My martial soul isn’t an Avenging Spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No?” Huo Yuhao was the shocked one right now. “What is it then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She opened her eyes wide and replied, “My martial soul is called the Spirit of Retribution.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spirit of Retribution? Is there such a martial soul?” Huo Yuhao couldn’t believe what she was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why isn’t there such a martial soul? I created it myself. Isn’t it magical?! Hehehehe!” She was laughing, but her laughter sounded very forlorn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao squinted. “Self-created martial soul? I know. Your martial soul is mutated, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, no, no!” She replied with three ‘nos’ and her forlorn voice turned callous. “Have you seen a mutated martial soul that only awakened when the soul master was fifteen? No, you haven’t. My martial soul came from hatred, a deep hatred. When my hatred reached its extreme, my Spirit of Retribution appeared. I killed her, I killed her, I killed her! I want revenge! I want revenge! All of you can go and die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She suddenly went berserk, and mimicked a lifting action. Following this, her second, third and fifth soul rings lit up at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A weird white glow spread from her body, and countless Grudges appeared above Huo Yuhao and started to spread in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, she saw a soul ring shining. It was a clear-white soul ring that flashed with a dim golden color. When its light spread from Huo Yuhao’s body, his eyes started to shine brightly, and turned shiny and translucent. Purplish-gold light that seemed to be illuminated by countless streaks of starlight flashed before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah——” The female evil soul master’s head suddenly rocked back, and she even staggered a few steps. The huge avenging spirit that had been drifting behind her all this while was dissipated before it re-formed. The Grudges that she had released earlier were also immediately crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Shock! It was Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock in the concrete-immaterial realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s body shook slightly. After all, this evil soul master’s cultivation was too strong, far superior to his. Although Huo Yuhao had an advantage in terms of his spiritual power, a fight between soul masters didn’t just involve spiritual power. Moreover, her spiritual world was filled with a grim sense of evil. While Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock struck her, he also suffered from a backlash. Of course, she was hurt much more than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he stepped forward with his left leg, the look in his eyes suddenly turned gentle. A golden projection appeared behind him before embracing him and fusing with his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s gaze turned gentle. At this moment, his eyes didn’t reflect the look of the evil soul master in front of him. There was only a look of remembrance in his eyes right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remembrance was a very magical thing. Right now, Huo Yuhao unleashed his Fist of Remembrance, which contained a surging feeling of remembrance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fist with an indescribable color, but which yet seemed to shine with a glow that encompassed all colors, was unleashed towards the evil soul master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the evil soul master was still suffering under the effects of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock. However, she was still a Soul Douluo, and it wouldn’t be so easy to curb her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao’s Fist of Remembrance was about to strike her, her body suddenly dissipated like a specter. She changed into countless black projections that spread around. Each projection had the same look as her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a sharp scream sounded at this point. All the black projections re-gathered and appeared where she was originally. It was as if she had been struck by Huo Yuhao’s fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her body was covered by a layer of shiny light as she screamed. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This, this is…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t say anything. He exerted a force with his front left foot and it seemed like he was being lifted up. He raised his right fist and pointed his middle and index fingers forward. The glow that seemed to encompass all colors suddenly shot into the sky and turned into a sword light that was more than ten meters long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression also changed. The gentle look in his eyes turned into pain. He pursed his lips tightly, and he appeared to have teared up. His mind seemed to have gone to another world too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majestic sword light descended from the sky. One’s swordplay could only reach the peak if he handled his relationship well. This time, it was Huo Yuhao’s Sword of Longing, a sword which would never be forgotten!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The evil soul master was in a daze as she looked at the sword light that was coming down. Her state of mind was already affected because of Huo Yuhao’s fist earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she was also a spiritual-type soul master, she was also more influenced than any other opponent. Her Spirit of Retribution relied on immense hatred. However, she was forced into a state of remembrance by Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah——” Her sense of danger roused her instincts. She lifted her hands, and her seventh soul ring shone. The huge avenging spirit behind her drifted forward and fused with her body. She turned into a specter, but she didn’t attack or resist Huo Yuhao’s attack. Instead, she turned around and fled. She wanted to escape from the sword light that was crashing down towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, how could she escape Huo Yuhao’s Sword of Longing after she was struck by his Fist of Remembrance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Sword of Longing immediately tore her avenging spirit to pieces. Wherever this sword light passed, spots of bright light were left behind in the air. It was as if tears of remembrance had been scattered in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crushed Spirit of Retribution was re-formed. However, it was no longer in the state of a Martial Soul True Body. Rather, it regained the appearance of the evil soul master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao should be proud of his Sword of Longing. Without his sixth soul ring, he managed to force an eight-ringed Soul Douluo out of her Martial Soul True Body using his self-created fighting skill. This showed how strong he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More astonishingly, the female evil soul master’s eyes were no longer bloodshot, and the look in her eyes became similar to Huo Yuhao’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had gone into closed-door cultivation for several months, and fused his various abilities. He had perfectly combined his spiritual and soul power through his emotions, forming his three great skills. No matter how strong his opponent was, she would be affected by him if she wasn’t emotionally resilient enough to resist the invasion of his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These three great skills were mainly controlled using Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power, as his spiritual power was far superior to his soul power. When he was able to increase his soul power to a comparable level and unleash these three skills, he would be able to establish himself as one of the strongest soul masters on the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After unleashing his sword, Huo Yuhao was already crying. He pulled his palm back to his waist before flipping it over. He formed the shape of a heart in the air and all the lights were retracted at this instant. There was now an additional heart at the center of his palm. It was a golden heart. Even the most dazzling gem in this world couldn’t compare to the glow from this golden heart.</span></p>
