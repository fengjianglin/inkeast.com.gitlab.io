He had to go back and prepare as quickly as possible before he would set off on his own journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned around to his companions and said, “Alright, let’s go, too.” His destination was, of course, the Star Luo Empire’s front lines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi laughed out loud, and released his martial soul proudly. He stared at his red soul ring, and was as pleased as he could be. Having a hundred-thousand year soul ring was very impressive for soul masters! Furthermore, hundred-thousand year soul beasts didn’t just provide soul rings – they also came with soul bones!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tortoise shell that had fused into his Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle before this was the soul bone that the Golden Tortoise had given him. Furthermore, this soul bone was the most valuable soul bone, a torso bone!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For defense-type soul masters, torso bones were much more important than skull bones!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi couldn’t wait any longer, soaring into the sky after releasing his martial soul. He was a Soul Sage now, and could fly through the air without using flying-type soul tools. He was an exhibitionist and a show-off at heart, so how could he give up this opportunity to try flying out!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi flew into the sky, and pulled Jiang Nannan along with him. Jiang Nannan was a lot more reserved than he was, but she didn’t reject her first time flying as a Soul Sage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu activated their respective flying-type soul tools and followed closely behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan and Ji Juechen followed suit. Huo Yuhao led everyone as they surged into the sky at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was relatively closer to where Huo Yuhao was. As everyone was rising into the air, her voice suddenly appeared in his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re lying!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had compressed her voice into a single line. Dong’er didn’t seem to possess such a level of control before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong glanced at him with rather sophisticated eyes, and took the initiative to fly up next to him as she whispered, “You were lying just now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did I lie about?” Huo Yuhao asked, confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong sounded a little proud as he said, “You were just lying about the Beast God protecting you with his strength. If he were protecting you, how could he sever your interaction with the God Realm’s aura? This opportunity only comes once in a blue moon, and it can even trigger a Godly Appointment. If the Beast God’s strength was protecting you, it should have been protecting you from being disturbed by others!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stared at her in surprise. He was very sure that Tang Wutong was Wang Dong’er, except that she was a little different from how Wang Dong’er was like before. He could see Wang Qiu’er’s shadow in her from time to time. However, even though Dong’er had lost her memory, she seemed to have gained knowledge that she didn’t have before! How did that happen?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong giggled and pressed, “I’m right, am I not? Why are you lying!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said warmly, “Why should I tell you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong said threateningly, “If you don’t tell me, I will expose your lie to everyone else, so that everyone will be unhappy with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed and said, “You’re just like a child!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you calling a child?” Tang Wutong raged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed again and said, “What’s wrong with being a child? Innocent and devoid of evil...I like how you’re behaving right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was momentarily stunned when she saw the love and concern in his eyes that he didn’t bother masking. She blushed, and quickly said indignantly, “You lecher! Are you asking for a beating? Are you telling me or not?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “Actually, it’s nothing much. I just didn’t want everyone to worry for me. The Beast God, Di Tian, did place some restrictions on me. You’re right, he wants to stop me from interacting with that illusory God Realm. What can I do? I can’t defeat him, and I can’t resist him. If he’s stopping me from doing so, then so be it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong glared at him with her large and pinkish-blue eyes. Her long eyelashes were quivering gently as she asked, “Do you know how important that state you that you were in is for your future?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly and replied, “Haven’t you told me already? Of course I know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong said, “Then why are you acting so indifferently? Since you’ve missed this opportunity, you may not come across another one in your entire lifetime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered, “You have no faith in me? But I have a lot of faith in myself...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was a little upset. “You’re so dense and unreasonable! I’m too lazy to care about you anymore.” She stretched out her wings behind her back as she spoke, and beat them forcefully as she flew towards the front.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s mood was a little suppressed before this, but he suddenly felt his spirits lift as he watched her charming back and her flowing pinkish-blue hair fluttering in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For him, what Tang Wutong had just said to him was a form of concern!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong’er, even though you’ve forgotten about me, are you still subconsciously concerned about me? Actually, everyone doesn’t know this, but being able to be together with you is more important than becoming a god to me. Brother Skydream and the others have their hopes placed on me, and I will definitely work hard to become a god, but you are always the most important in my heart! No matter what, even if you’ve forgotten who I was before, I will definitely bring us together again as we are now!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Butterfly Wings stretched out behind his back, and he accelerated as he chased after Tang Wutong. He flew behind her without going too fast or too slow and watched her enchanting back. For Huo Yuhao, this was the best form of relaxation for his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong continued flying in the front. She didn’t interact with anyone else because she wasn’t familiar with the others. The more she flew, the more she felt as if something was wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She subconsciously turned around, and was met with Huo Yuhao’s mesmerized eyes. She trembled, and almost lost her balance in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you looking at?” Tang Wutong was beside herself with fury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered, “I’m looking at you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you staring at me so lecherously?” Tang Wutong said ferociously. But she was just too beautiful, and even though she was deliberately trying to put on a ferocious and wicked outward appearance, she was still so cute in Huo Yuhao’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt amused as he said, “What? I can’t look at you? I’m just flying behind you, so isn’t it normal that my eyes are on you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re not allowed to look at me!” Tang Wutong raged.&nbsp;</span></p>

You can’t ask me to close my eyes when I fly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong grunted coldly and said, “You’ll fly in front me and stare at the air by yourself.”</span></p>

He nodded and said, “Alright,” He immediately flew in front of her in a flash.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Nan Qiuqiu was pouting, and a little displeased as she said, “Look at them, they’re flirting in public! Hmph! She lost her memory? I think they’re just putting on a show!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi shook her head softly and said, “Try to be unbiased, pretty girl. Are you interested in him too? You should be able to tell from his eyes that he can’t possibly like anyone else other than her. Is one-sided love so interesting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu giggled and said, “You’re trying hard to convince yourself by saying all that, right, sister Guyi? I wasn’t paying attention to Huo Yuhao’s eyes, but I saw a lot of yours. Ever since he came back, your eyes keep turning towards him carelessly. What are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi blushed and retorted, “Why can’t I look at him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu laughed and shot back, “You can look at him, but you can’t have him. Aren’t you worried?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi grunted and suddenly sped up as she surged towards the front and said nothing else. There was a faint trace of helplessness in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You may like someone, but that someone may not have the same feelings for you...</span></p>

Perhaps that was because he was simply too outstanding, and he had attracted her attention ever since the beginning. Ever since then, she couldn’t notice other men at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was, Ye Guyi didn’t know how many times she had chided herself gloomily to walk away from her one-sided love, but discovered that she couldn’t do it at all. The more she wanted to walk away, the deeper his figure was imprinted in her mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She gave up trying towards the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s like that already... if I like him, then so be it. I’m liking him while I’m cultivating at the same time, anyway.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;She didn’t have any family, and nobody would hurry or urge her to find a man. She spent most of her time and energy cultivating, and she would let nature take its course with her feelings and love. Smoothing her state of mind and keeping peace with herself was a lot more comfortable. Thinking about Huo Yuhao from time to time was a kind of bliss for her, especially after he returned; her happiness was more conspicuous when she saw him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t wish or hope for anything at all, and was just staring at him quietly. She realized that she was quite satisfied with how things were. She had mocked herself, she had felt speechless about herself, but so what? She would have walked away from her feelings a long time ago if she could. Wang Qiu’er was so outstanding, but even she couldn’t move his heart, and she even sacrificed herself to save him, in the end.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I have never done anything for him, so I’m just going to bury my feelings for him deep inside my heart. Maybe, after a long time, these feelings will dampen, and I will naturally forget about them. Or, another man that can move me will appear and take his place in my heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi didn’t have much faith in the latter. Finding someone who was more outstanding than Huo Yuhao seemed a little challenging.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t know about the changes in Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu’s mentalities. He was flying in front, and still wore a faint smile on his face. His spiritual power was powerful, and he could clearly feel that there was a pair of pinkish-blue eyes trained on him from behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether I am watching the person I love, or the person I love is watching me is a kind of happiness! It’s so nice that Dong’er is back...</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

She couldn’t help but start to daydream.</span></p>

He was just flying in front of her quietly, and he clearly wasn’t doing anything, but he seemed to integrate into the air around him, as though he were part of that air and space in the first place, while she and everyone else were outsiders.</span></p>
