Aren’t they supposed to be individual?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was confused as he replied, “Of course we stay in the same room.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sect masters’ expression changed. The second sect master asked anxiously, “How many beds are there in the room?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao even more confused as he answered, “Of course there are two beds. Although we’re guys, we can’t possibly sleep together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh.” The two sect masters heaved a sigh of relief and looked at each other. They could each see the look of helpless mirth on the other’s face…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t understand at all. “Sect masters, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master forced a smile and replied, “Nothing. Wang Dong has been a clean freak since he was young. We had thought that he lived alone. We didn’t expect that the two of you would be staying in the same room. He must have brought you a lot of trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “It’s true that he’s a clean freak. However, he’s also very lazy. Aside from his own bed, he doesn’t tidy up the room at all. I’m the one who tidies up the place every morning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recounted how they met each other and became classmates, as well as how they were sent to compete together in the academy’s tournament. He also related everything that had happened after that, and the close friendship that they shared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sect masters listened to him attentively. Apart from the initial interruption, they didn’t disrupt him anymore, obviously very interested in what he had to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was also recalling everything that had happened as he recounted everything to them. He was also very excited, especially when he talked about their experience in the Elite Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. He was very animated as he described everything, especially when he got to the four martial fusion soul skills that they shared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sect masters also relaxed the more they listened to him. They weren’t just smiling or nodding their heads slightly as they listened to him now. Their gazes appeared much gentler, too. Huo Yuhao didn’t mention how he had saved Wang Dong, but the two sect masters could tell a lot of things from his expression, behavior, and tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed very quickly, and it was soon noontime. The two sect masters dragged Huo Yuhao out for lunch, after which he continued speaking for another two hours. He only stopped when they returned to Clear Sky Castle. In the meantime, Huo Yuhao didn’t talk about himself at all. He only recounted everything that had happened between him and Wang Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is roughly what has happened.” Huo Yuhao spoke until his throat was dry. However, he could sense that the two elders’ attitude towards him had changed after he told them everything. They appeared much closer to him, and this was proven clearly from the way they spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master smiled as he said, “Yuhao, your experiences with Wang Dong are very enriching! No wonder the two of you have such a close relationship.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “It’s my fortune to have Wang Dong as my good brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master gestured and said, “You should stop calling us sect masters. My surname is Niu and my full name is Niu Tian. My second brother’s surname is Tai and his full name is Tai Tan. You can call us uncles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief. If they were other people, he would have stormed off from the cautious and scornful way they treated him before. However, they were Wang Dong’s elders. He had no choice but to tolerate them. But now it seemed that he had finally earned their recognition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Uncle Niu.” Huo Yuhao answered hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian said in a deep voice, “Yuhao, both second brother and I saw what happened to you that day. There must be more than one immense force in your body. That teacher of yours… it’s a pity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s face turned slightly pale, and he revealed a deep sorrow in his eyes. “He did it to save me. I’m sorry, uncles. I don’t want to talk about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian nodded and said, “Everyone has their own secrets. We won’t probe either. However, you were critically injured that day. I can feel that the pressure on you was very heavy. How are you now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “My body is already fine, but my spiritual sea was damaged, and has shrunk a little. I will try to restore it through cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian was shocked. “Your spiritual sea was damaged?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan was much more direct. “Kid, don’t tell lies in front of honest people. If your spiritual sea was damaged, how could you be sitting here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned, and replied, “My spiritual sea was indeed damaged! However, my spiritual origin is fine, although my spiritual powers have dropped a little.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan was doubtful. “Your spiritual sea and spiritual origin belong together. Don’t tell me you can separate them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I didn’t. However, the damage to my spiritual sea didn’t affect my spiritual origin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian said, “Can I take a look at your spiritual sea? I have no other intention but to see whether I can heal it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Thanks, Uncle Niu.” Huo Yuhao knew that they weren’t completely confident in him. After all, even Wang Dong didn’t know his secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian stood up and came before Huo Yuhao. He pressed his right hand on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t resist, and relaxed. With the abilities of these two sect masters, he couldn’t resist if they wanted to harm him, anyway. They were at Elder Xuan’s level, and the Clear Sky Sect was once the top soul master sect on the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian’s eyes slowly turned green. Huo Yuhao only sensed a gentle aura surging into his mind. That gentle aura moved down his body. At the same time, a warm feeling circulated around his body. Huo Yuhao felt very comfortable, and his passageways even started to heal at a faster rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That gentle aura then ascended and slowly entered his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shut his eyes. He could sense that the aura was being manifested as a wave of green gas. He couldn’t tell whether it was spiritual or soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that green gas entered his spiritual sea, it started to drift and move about inside. It didn’t start any waves in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Green lights surged and started to spread in the spiritual sea. He only felt a refreshing chill coming from his forehead. His entire spiritual world seemed to have been cleansed. His damaged spiritual sea was slowing recovering under the effect of this magical force. His spiritual power was also increasing. This was an extremely magical and delightful feeling. It felt a little like when he saw the sea of clouds appearing above Clear Sky Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some time, the refreshing chill faded away, and Huo Yuhao was surprised to discover that the damage to his spiritual sea had been restored. Although it wasn’t restored to the level of the Boundless Ocean, its capacity had returned to normal. This also meant that his spiritual power could return to its peak state through continuous deep meditation, which would only take a few months. From his initial estimates, he had thought that it would take more than three years to recover, given the level of damage to his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He opened his eyes and appeared much more vibrant than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian was still standing in front and smiling at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks, Uncle Niu.” Huo Yuhao stood up and bowed towards him respectfully. This time, he was completely won over. He didn’t think anyone would have been able to heal the damage to his spiritual sea, with the possible exception of Elder Mu, if he were still alive. However, the Clear Sky Sect’s sect master was able to do so. In Huo Yuhao’s mind, he was on the same level as Du Busi.</span></p>

Furthermore, I can also sense that your control over your spiritual power is very good. This is a good thing. No wonder Wang Dong said that you are talented! I could also sense the presence of a second mental sea in your spiritual sea. When your spiritual sea was damaged, your spiritual origin was automatically protected by your second mental sea. When everything ended, your spiritual origin returned to your spiritual sea. I’m afraid you didn’t even realize this.”</span></p>

You can sense so much just by exploring a bit. I indeed didn’t know what happened then.”</span></p>

As long as I can do it, I will do it.” Huo Yuhao truly respected him. His control over his strength displayed his abilities as a truly powerful individual. Furthermore, Niu Tian was only making this request after treating him, and didn’t use the treatment to exchange for his help. Huo Yuhao respected him even more for that.</span></p>

It is also an existence of pure strength. I want to know what exactly this embryo will become, as well as the changes it will experience in the future. I have a feeling that this is the first time something like this has appeared on the continent. That’s why I hope you can tell me what you feel if the embryo in your second mental sea changes in any way. Of course, I can also help you if you get into any sort of trouble. At least, I won’t let you be harmed. What do you think?”</span></p>
