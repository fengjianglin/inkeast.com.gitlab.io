 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After fifteen minutes, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s soul power suddenly rose to Rank 96.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In another hour, their soul power rose to Rank 97.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours later, they were Rank 98.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In less than four hours, their cultivations had increased to Rank 98 with the help of the two Ultimate Douluo. When they reached that point, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s hands were no longer holding on to each other anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like they had judged earlier, their Haodong Power could no longer flow between them when their cultivation reached a certain tier. This was because it was too powerful. It was so strong that they themselves couldn’t handle it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only by letting go of each other’s hands that the soul power circulating in their bodies would weaken. This would open up more places in their bodies to circulate the immense soul power of an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui transferred purified soul power into them, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong only realized how dense Ultimate Douluo soul power was when they received it. Their soul power felt completely boundless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was well-aware that he and Tang Wutong might not win against either one of them even if they teamed up. It was much more likely that they would lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cultivations of these two individuals were simply too astonishing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his soul power got stronger and stronger, Huo Yuhao’s soul cores started to gradually slow down. Huo Yuhao only felt that his body was ballooning more and more. It seemed like it could blow apart at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to set a foundation for the establishment of your third soul core. You have a very strong foundation now. Your first soul core is in your brow, while your second soul core is in your chest. Your dantian is free for your third soul core to occupy. Next, your third soul core can only be space-type. Furthermore, your third soul core has to be woven in an alternatively up and down pattern. Finally, your three soul cores should be well-connected and well-linked to one another, to maximize their real power. I can’t help you with the final circulation, but I can help you build a foundation in your dantian. In the future, what you have to do is link this third soul core with your other two soul cores. It’s only through this that you can become an Ultimate Douluo. As for how strong you will be then, I wouldn’t know. I’ll pray for you and Mu En from another world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s voice appeared in Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea. Following this, Huo Yuhao sensed that the soul power pouring into his body by Long Xiaoyao had surged to his dantian. At the same time, some of it had separated and isolated the area above his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His cultivation is simply boundless! It’s too powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An outline of small soul cores was quickly constructed. Huo Yuhao’s two other soul cores were isolated, and felt nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The circulation of soul power in his dantian was the same as that at his brow area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had never considered the problem of how to make three soul cores circulate in tandem with one another. However, it would become an important consideration from now on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Long Xiaoyao didn’t mention it, Huo Yuhao knew that his three soul cores would bring him a lot of problems in the future if he didn’t take them into consideration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s body was also filled with soul power right now. However, she was in a more troublesome situation. This was because her first soul core was already in her dantian, even though her second soul core was in her brow. Only her chest could contain her third soul core. Her chest was where the soul power from her two current soul cores interacted. Her whirlpool-like soul power was generated there. How was she going to outline her third soul core?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering over it for a moment, Ye Xishui shared her thoughts with Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao had already helped Huo Yuhao with his third soul core. After he heard Ye Xishui’s words, he immediately stood up and came in front of Tang Wutong. He sat cross-legged in front of her and clasped his palms with her. He took the front, while Ye Xishui took the back. Tang Wutong was at the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao said, “It’s impossible for her to construct her third soul core in this condition. We can only put her in the same situation as Yuhao before there’s any possibility of completion. That’s why we have to shift the positions of her soul cores.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui couldn’t help but laugh when she heard Long Xiaoyao’s words, “That’s a good idea. I didn’t expect us to team up together to do something good one day. It’s a great feeling! Let’s begin then. I’ll lift her while you protect her. If we can’t succeed, there’s no one else in this world who can. Even if we don’t, there’s no danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t she right? Even Di Tian could only win against one of them. If they both fought him at the same time, he might not actually win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s soul core in her dantian was slowly lifted up, and gradually transferred to her chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s scales slowly turned blood-red, while Ye Xishui’s body turned illusory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sat where he was cross-legged. He silently sensed the changes in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul power in both his soul cores was already fully nourished. His third soul core had started to form, but it was isolated. The power used to isolate his third soul core was a seal implanted in his body by Long Xiaoyao. As long as it wasn’t removed, it would continue to isolate his third soul core. However, once it was broken, he had to immediately try to fuse his three soul cores. Otherwise, he was bound to die once there was any chaos in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he had directly absorbed Long Xiaoyao’s soul power, there was still a part of it that he couldn’t absorb yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As an Ultimate Douluo, Long Xiaoyao’s soul power was like essence. He had filtered out the elemental type of his soul power, but still transferred quite a lot of it to Huo Yuhao. As a result, Huo Yuhao couldn’t absorb all his soul power. His body couldn’t take it yet, not even though he was already so strong. This was because Rank 98 was already close to the extreme, while Rank 99 was the human limit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he reached this tier, he fully understood the problems that came with great power. Huo Yuhao’s senses were becoming more and more acute. Every minor change that happened to his internal soul power was stirring. It felt as if he might blow apart and die if he didn’t control his soul power well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The extra soul power was compressed in his dantian by Long Xiaoyao. It was where his third soul core was going to be. Huo Yuhao didn’t know how much soul power was going to be in his third soul core. He didn’t even dare to use his spiritual power to check.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to get used to his Rank 98 soul power before he could gradually control it. He could only try to form his third soul core after everything was clear. Otherwise, if he catalyzed a war between his current two soul cores and his third soul core, he was the only one who was going to suffer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was Long Xiaoyao or Ye Xishui, they had never faced this issue with a third soul core before. They were only trying things out, but it was an experiment that couldn’t fail. This was because the experiments were conducted on Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s bodies! If they failed, the two of them would be wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s condition was gradually stabilizing. Even Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao felt that this was a little weird. Tang Wutong’s passageways were very smooth. They didn’t meet with any trouble at all. Furthermore, Tang Wutong’s control was also very immaculate. She wasn’t in any danger at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of this, it was much easier for them to pour in their soul power into her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Long Xiaoyao returned to Huo Yuhao’s side, he poured his remaining soul power into him. Huo Yuhao’s third soul core slowly took form. The whirlpool became bigger and bigger, before it started to compress inward. Very soon, Huo Yuhao saw a pure-white entity appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why it was white was because it didn’t have any elemental type. Huo Yuhao had to give it an elemental type in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was terrifying. At least this was what Huo Yuhao thought. What if he failed? Of course, he knew that he could quickly make a breakthrough to become an Ultimate Douluo after he absorbed Long Xiaoyao’s soul power. However, without a doubt, it was much more dangerous for external soul power to surge into his body compared to the surge of his own soul power in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, everything was relative. If he relied on himself to cultivate and form his third soul core, he would certainly face the issue of a lack of soul power. With an Ultimate Douluo setting the foundation for him now, he would not meet such a problem in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had already decided, he could only carry on like this. It was such a rare opportunity. To Huo Yuhao, he wasn’t very excited. Rather, he was extra careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed second by second. Huo Yuhao was consistently sensing the changes to the soul power in his body. Fortunately, everything was proceeding very smoothly. The barrier that Long Xiaoyao had placed in his chest was very solid. It didn’t waver at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul power that was pouring into his body grew fainter. After that, it became weaker. Finally, Huo Yuhao’s body entered a state of calm when the last streak of soul power was poured into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he opened his eyes, Huo Yuhao immediately turned to look behind him. He only saw Long Xiaoyao smiling behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Long Xiaoyao was much more elderly than he normally looked.
