 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden flames were so scorching that the Holy Ghost Church’s Consecrated all unwittingly took a step back, not daring to touch the flames. It felt like Yan Shaozhe was burning his own spirit and body right now, purifying everything he had from this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is, is he mad? He’s killing himself?” Zhongli Wu was in a daze when he saw the burning flames, and completely stunned. He didn’t understand why Yan Shaozhe would make such a choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flames slowly extinguished. Yan Shaozhe had disappeared, along with any trace of his aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu should have been delighted that the Dean of the Martial Soul Department of Shrek Academy and the heir to the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion was dead. However, he felt that Yan Shaozhe had died too easily as a Transcendent Douluo. If it were him, he would have done his best to fight his way out, even if he was encircled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right, where’s the rest of those from Shrek Academy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When I first came out of the tent earlier, I saw at least seven or eight people from Shrek Academy. However, they were protected by the phoenix flames and concealed by the blizzard. Yan Shaozhe was fighting so hard to cover them. However, he’s the Dean of their Martial Soul Department. No, something isn’t right...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick, go search for them! We must not let them escape!” As he spoke, Zhongli Wu flashed away, flying towards the location where the people from the Holy Ghost Church were gathered earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned very grim when he came to where everyone from the Holy Ghost Church had assembled. On the ground was corpse after corpse. In just this short period of time, more than ten people from the Holy Ghost Church had died. Although most of them were Soul Emperors, they were still the elites of the church, since they were sent to the front line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t easy to nurture an evil soul master. Now that ten of them had died in one go, Zhongli Wu felt his heart ache. It wasn’t just ten of them. The Masquerade Douluo had also been burned to death, and the Bluesilver Holy Lady was missing. Twelve were gone, including two extremely important individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu felt his blood surging. He was about to spit out blood. “Bastard!” he shouted furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, those in the command tent had also reacted. Lin Hai came over, too. For some reason, he was gloating inside when he saw those dead evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one liked evil soul masters, even the soldiers on the same side as them. Evil soul masters couldn’t even be considered humans in the eyes of ordinary people. But everyone had to be prudent in front of them. Even Lin Hai wasn’t an exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Imperial Tutor, I’ve already summoned the leaders of the soul engineer legions we have in the sky. They also didn’t see how the raiders escaped. I’ve already given an order to search the entire base for them. All surveillance soul tools are operating to find them, too. The Heavenly Soul Empire has also retreated. It seems like they planned this attack; it was an ambush. How bad are your losses over here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu took a few deep breaths and tried to suppress his rage.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How bad are my losses? Incredibly bad!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Hai was already doing very well to cope with the situation. Even if he wanted to rage, he couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, please help me find them. Even if you have to dig one meter into the ground, I want them found!” Zhongli Wu ordered coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Lin Hai acknowledged his words before turning and leaving. He wasn’t willing to stay too long. It was too dangerous, given how Zhongli Wu looked like a walking volcano right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire base got busy. Lin Hai even got his men to dig one meter into the ground. After all, the people from Shrek Academy couldn’t possibly have vanished into thin air, they must have had some way of leaving. There were soul engineers and surveillance soul tools in the sky. Even if they could conceal themselves, they couldn’t have possibly escaped their encirclement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the tents in the core region of the base were temporarily dismantled before the ground was dug up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, nothing came up even after two days. Not only was Zhongli Wu extremely infuriated, even Lin Hai was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t tell me they really can disappear into thin air? If Shrek Academy possesses such mysterious and magical powers, they would definitely be a much greater threat…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Sun Moon Empire was puzzling over this matter, those from Shrek Academy were doing very well in the demiplane. The only worrying thing was Tang Ya’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had returned to the demiplane and sealed it shut. Even if the Sun Moon Empire dug ten meters into the ground, they couldn’t possibly find them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Yan Shaozhe disappeared, none of their enemies could find any trace of them. Under the cover of the blizzard and phoenix flames, no one saw how they had escaped the scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya wasn’t in very good shape. She lay in Bei Bei’s arms with her eyes closed. She was terrifyingly pale, and clutching her head in her hands, evidently in great pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, what do we do?” Bei Bei looked at Huo Yuhao like he was asking for help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “According to what the Delicate Silk Immortal told me, Teacher Xiao Ya should have been affected by some kind of evil poison. This poison has already spread to every part of her body, including her martial soul and spiritual sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Delicate Silk Immortal gave me a spiritual pill that she cultivated. It should be able to expel some of the poison. However, the problem is that the poison has fused too deeply with Teacher Xiao Ya. As she slowly detoxifies, her life energy might also slowly dissipate. She’ll grow weaker and weaker. This is why we need to find the Bluesilver Emperor, to fuse her life energy with her martial soul. By absorbing the Bluesilver Emperor’s strength, she’ll be able to stimulate the origin of her martial soul, re-igniting her life energy. This will allow her to live.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei asked, “What should we do with her now? What if we don’t treat her now? Wasn’t she doing very well in the Holy Ghost Church?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “It’s impossible to maintain her condition, seeing how she is now. She was greatly affected when she saw you, and her consciousness is slowly coming back. This has caused a reaction in the evil poison in her body. If she continues to take in more evil poison, she might be able to maintain her condition, but she’ll be more poisoned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, we don’t have any evil poison to give her. We need to start detoxifying her. Otherwise, once the poison runs riot in her body, even an immortal won’t be able to save her life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He asked, “Yuhao, tell me the truth. If we continue to detoxify her, how much longer can she live?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “I can’t tell; it depends on how fast she’s being cleansed. In my opinion, she’ll only last half a year to a year’s time, somewhere within that range.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei remained quiet. When he saw how pale Tang Ya was, he gritted his teeth and said, “Alright, let’s start. Within half a year, I’ll do my best to find the Bluesilver Emperor for her. If I can’t, that’s it for her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed silently in his heart when he saw how desperate Bei Bei looked. There was no other way. They couldn’t possibly return her to the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, let me check her body first.” He was already familiar with the Poison Scripture passed down in the Tang Sect, and was one of the best in terms of his understanding of all types of lethal poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retrieved the pill, which was releasing a dim pinkish glow, and letting out a light fragrance. When everyone smelled this scent, they couldn’t help but feel refreshed. Even Ye Guyi felt much more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this pinkish glow touched Tang Ya, the pill shone slightly brighter. The glow also instantly turned darker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s body shook, and she trembled a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, dark-blue patterns surfaced on her skin. It was like the patterns on her dark Bluesilver Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retrieved a needle and pricked Tang Ya’s finger. A drop of blood fell out. The pill received this drop of blood, which was slightly darker in hue than normal blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pill was originally faintly pinkish in color, but it turned dark pink after receiving that drop of blood. The drop of blood seemed to have vaporized, and a dark blue fog gradually rose from the pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used his other hand to cover the top of the pill, unleashing his Ice Empress’ Pincer. Under the effect of the aura of Ultimate Ice, the fog that rose up immediately condensed into powder and attached to the frozen ice crystals.</span></p>
