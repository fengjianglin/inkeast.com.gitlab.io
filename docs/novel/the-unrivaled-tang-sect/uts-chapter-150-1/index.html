 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Single-Horned Devilrhino jerked its body as Huo Yuhao lunged at it, attempting to impale Huo Yuhao with the drill-like horn on its head..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was prepared to dodge this attack, knowing full well that he couldn’t down this Devilrhino in a single strike. The Devilrhino’s head is its most vital area, and its most armored, not even the Darkgolden Terrorclaws have a good chance of penetrating it in one shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But a peculiar coincidence happened once more. . .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Single-Horned Devilrhino’s body shook as it was running, so its front hoof stepped into a small hole formed during the previous battle, but the small hole was slanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devilrhino was more than four meters long. Its body was thick and burly, and it weighed more than three thousand kilos. Its front hoof suddenly twisted, and caused its entire body to slant along with it. The horn it stabbed at Huo Yuhao completely missed, and its head was critically exposed to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Squelch—” Huo Yuhao wouldn’t be in the Shrek’s Seven Monster’s if he couldn’t capitalize on the mistakes of an enemy. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw’s five talons bunched together like a woodpecker’s sharp beak, and pierced through the Devilrhino’s eye when its head turned towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Single-Horned Devilrhino was taken by great surprise when its body slanted to one side, and it even forgot to close its eyes to protect them with its thick eyelids.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How soft and weak were one’s eyes? Furthermore, it was the Darkgolden Terrorclaw that stabbed into the eye. Huo Yuhao’s dark golden sharp blades jabbed into the Single-Horned Devilrhino’s head instantly, and its colossal body crashed to the ground with an agonizing howl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark golden talons turned an icy-white, and Huo Yuhao’s right arm was covered in a diamond-like layer of crystals. The harrowing screams of a dying Devilrhino ceased, and its head was blanketed in a layer of frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its body was excessively huge, and even Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice couldn’t freeze its entire body within a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strike was too fluid for that. His body sprung into the sky once more as the soul thruster on his back launched him with great might—at another Single-Horned Devilrhino.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the other Single-Horned Devilrhino’s suddenly lost their footing at the same time. Even Huo Yuhao, agent of their demise, found this unbelievable. One of the Devilrhino’s collapsed, falling right onto the Golden Tiger’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corpse exploded from the Ice Explosion soul skill, and the enormous body of the Single-Horned Devilrhino was tossed into the air. The frightening power of the Ice Explosion soul skill made He Caitou think back to their encounter with the corpse explosion back with the evil soul masters inside the cave. The gigantic Single-Horned Devilrhino was blown to smithereens, and its horn was blasted from the explosive force, landing right on a vulnerable long-range soul beast’s head—and piercing right through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Single-Horned Devilrhinos were all locked onto Huo Yuhao, so they didn’t threaten He Caitou at all, who was currently attacking with all his might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior brother, try attacking those long-range soul beasts’ eyes. Fire in bursts, and conserve soul power!” Huo Yuhao yelled out while his Darkgolden Terrorclaw easily pierced through another Devilrhino’s eye. The incredibly strange thing was that this Single-Horned Devilrhino was also inexplicably incapable of closing its eyes in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The long-ranged attacking soul beasts were definitely not in normal condition. Their mobility was reduced, and even after waves of attacks being launched at Huo Yuhao and He Caitou, not a single attack hit. Their ability to lock onto targets had vanished, and their luck with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aiming at the soul beasts wasn’t difficult for He Caitou, but soul beasts had very sensitive perceptions, and would swiftly dodge away when they felt something was off. Soul tools could lock on targets, but only one body at a time, and not onto a particularly small region. Still, He Caitou acted according to Huo Yuhao’s suggestions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these incredible, miraculous, and even insidious occurrences caused his confidence in Huo Yuhao to increase many times over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battlefield was already extremely chaotic. Two of the four Single-Horned Devilrhinos were eliminated by Huo Yuhao in a matter of seconds, and one was killed by the Ice Explosion. The remaining Devilrhino struggled back to its feet and continued charging towards Huo Yuhao. He Caitou managed to take out two long-range soul beasts, and another one was eliminated by the exploded Devilrhino’s flying horn. There were five more ranged soul beasts to kill, but skull projections still lingered over their head while they stumbled like before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eye of Destiny judged them with the Light of Destiny. Combined with Huo Yuhao’s third soul skill, Enfeeblement, was the cause of everything that had just happened and was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao finally understood the true meaning of destiny’s judgement. A golden shadow glimmered behind his back, and there were wheels of light protecting it. This was the radiance and fortune bestowed upon him by destiny, while those soul beasts were abandoned by destiny’s judgment. Their bodies seemed to be plagued by the god of weakness. It was a pity that even though Huo Yuhao was the creator of their bad destiny, he couldn’t change his own destiny. If not, the situation would have been even more sinister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Enfeeblement? This was a domain-type soul skill, so it should rightfully be called Mass Enfeeblement. Those that were struck by Huo Yuhao’s spiritual fluctuations would find their central nervous system affected. Enfeeblement didn’t diminish the target’s soul power, but it would cause the target to experience dizziness and weakness in their lower limbs, among other things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All these crippling effects weren’t conclusive. However, Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement’s most potent effect, was that it could be extended for a long period of time. He had only absorbed six-thousand years out of the whole fifteen thousand in the soul ring, but he could still channel Mass Enfeeblement for an entire minute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These twelve soul beasts were impeded by Mass Enfeeblement, and they were judged by destiny at the same time. One could only imagine their dire state. Huo Yuhao took this opportunity, and three Single-Horned Devilrhinos were felled, the tables had turned!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tch, tch, tch.” Three brilliant needle-like beams flashed by. Three long-range soul beast’s heads erupted in a cloud of blood mist simultaneously—all of them were attacked through their eyes, and their brains were vaporized instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A long and thin soul tool could be seen on He Caitou’s shoulder. Its foremost point was shaped like a cone, and those thin light beams were fired from the cone-like tip of this soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His three simultaneous blasts could only be described as the work of a sharpshooter. While the distance between him and his targets wasn’t even a hundred meters, the souls beasts were dodging swiftly, without stopping. Not even Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection could help him aim at those soul beasts’ eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou faintly felt as if there was an unknown force guiding him when he was firing these three shots. When the feeling peaked, he only aimed in roughly the right direction and fired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eight long-range soul beasts dwindled into two very quickly, while the last Single-Horned Devilrhino arrived before Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Single-Horned Devilrhino had formidable defense and offense. However, it wasn’t agile enough in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track and brushed past the Devilrhino’s side. Even though the Single-Horned Devilrhino had already locked onto Huo Yuhao, it still needed time to turn its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao grasped this opportunity, and his Darkgolden Terrorclaw slashed down ferociously—the sharp dark-golden blades slashing through the weak underbelly of the Devilrhino.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Single-Horned Devilrhino was the most defensively capable foe Huo Yuhao had come across since obtaining the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Right Palm Bone. Even his Darkgolden Terrorclaw couldn’t stab all the way into the soft underbelly of the Devilrhino, only halfway through instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, half was enough for Huo Yuhao. He bounced off the ground and plastered his entire body onto the Devilrhino’s side. Meanwhile his Darkgolden Terrorclaw turned an icy-blue—the Ice Empress’ Pincer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress’ Pincer gave the Darkgolden Terrorclaw the Ultimate Ice element, and greatly boosted the strength of Huo Yuhao’s right hand.</span></p>

His spiritual power had been thoroughly drained from the series of battle, to the point where he didn’t even attempt a simple Spiritual Shock.</span></p>

The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s shadow shimmered for a second behind his back, and a blanket of icy-green light immediately expanded outwards in the next moment. The struggling Devilrhino froze in place, unable to shake off Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

Before long, the entire body was coated in a layer of sparkling and translucent ice crystals, the Devilrhino was motionless, like an ice statue.</span></p>

He was supporting himself against the back with his hands as he panted with deep and heavy breaths—his face as pale as a ghost.</span></p>

He felt like he’d been hit with his own Enfeeblement as his body fell into a crippling state of weakness, while his spiritual power and soul power were spent The Domain of Perpetual Ice infiltrated through the open wound caused by the Darkgolden Terrorclaw and stopped the beast’s heart, instantly turning it into an ice sculpture..&nbsp;</span></p>

He quickly took out another thick and thin cigar and stuffed them into his mouth, before he lit them and sucked on them as hard as he could. He took out the Milk Bottle at the same time, and restored his soul power.</span></p>
