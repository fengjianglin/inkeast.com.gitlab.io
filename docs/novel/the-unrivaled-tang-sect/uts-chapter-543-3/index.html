 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The image lifted her hands as a blue hexagonal crystal appeared in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empress was about to hit her, it was blocked by this crystal. The attack disintegrated immediately, and the Princess of the Sea remained unharmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this… the Ocean Heart?” The Snow Empress asked in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ocean Heart was a fabled super soul skill which only Merfolk with the golden bloodline could control and use. It could grant its user immunity from any energy-based attack once. Following which, it would transfer the energy within the attack it had absorbed to the user, allowing them to combine that power with their own power for their next attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Princess held the Ocean Heart, she neutralized the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses and absorbed its energy. Following which, her entire body turned a brilliant gold as her spiritual energy surged and caused huge waves throughout the entire Ice Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea raised the Ocean Heart high up in the sky as a blue pillar of light shot straight up into the sky at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This blue pillar contained an insane amount of energy. It consisted of water-type elemental energy, Ultimate Ice energy from the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses, and the insane spiritual energy from the Princess of the Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This attack was called the Curse of the Ocean Heart! It was truly the strongest attack the Princess of the Sea was capable of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the blue light was released, the entire sky above the Ice Sea darkened. Countless lightning bolts flickered in the sky, as though the sky was about to crack and fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress and Ice Empress were both stunned by the powerful blow coming their way. The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass started to tremble in fear, while Little Bai’s jaws dropped as it stopped its storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The streak of blue light was going straight for Tang Wutong, and destroying everything that stood between it and her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress definitely knew how powerful the streak of light was. Before she became a Spirit, she was also able to kill her enemies with a single blow from her Snowless Glacier after setting up her domain. Unless it was truly necessary, soul beasts which possessed such high cultivation levels would never use such deadly techniques. The Princess of the Sea must have felt sufficiently threatened by Tang Wutong’s ninth soul skill to have decided to use her Ocean Heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One must know that the Ocean Heart would require a month to recharge before it could be used again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Tang Wutong seemed to be in her own world. She appeared to be completely oblivious to her surroundings. As the blue light continued to get closer to her, she did not show any signs of resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden light flashed as it moved in front of Tang Wutong. It was the Life Reflection Shield, which had landed in her hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this crucial moment, the Skydream Iceworm was the only one who was still able to keep himself clear-headed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It definitely knew that he would not be able to block this blow. However, he just wanted to fight for some time for Tang Wutong. At this instant, he was just thinking about all the things that had happened between Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, as well as the tribulations he had overcome with Huo Yuhao. He had no hesitation or any ulterior motives. All he wanted to do was protect Tang Wutong for that short instant for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And then, at that very instant, Huo Yuhao—who had been unconscious—was suddenly awakened by some mysterious energy. His eyes suddenly lit up with fear and determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dong’er! Wutong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blinding light flashed as all four Spirits were thrown aside by Huo Yuhao. He immediately planted himself before Tang Wutong just when the blue light was only three meters away from her. He extended his right hand to grab the Life Reflection Shield from Tang Wutong before swinging it out of the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around to face Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes slowly closed as he fell back into his unconscious state. However, his face revealed a satisfied smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not know what the blue light was. In fact, his entire “awakening” was purely subconscious. However, he was already satisfied with what had just happened. He was able to take the blow for his loved one. What could be more satisfying than waking up for this short instant to do that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm morphed back into its human form after being tossed out of the way. Tears were already streaming down his face as he tried to control his emotions. The other Spirits rushed towards Huo Yuhao after realizing what he was about to do as they tried to block the blow for him. However, it was too late. The Curse of the Ocean Heart was already at his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, the five Spirits’ minds blanked out. They naturally knew why Huo Yuhao would push them out of the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because they had all previously absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, the foundation of their spiritual awareness was very stable. Even if he were to die, they would still be able to live on and pursue their goals through alternate means. Their lives would not be threatened, at least in the short run. Huo Yuhao did not want them to die for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea and her daughter were also shocked to see Huo Yuhao put his body in front of Tang Wutong without any hesitation. They were very uncomfortable seeing his demonstration of love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This human is actually willing to sacrifice himself to save his companions! Does he really deserve to die?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was already too late. The attack released by the Princess of the Sea had already reached Huo Yuhao’s back. The Princess of the Sea did not believe that he would be able to withstand this attack. Both Tang Wutong—the human which seemed to threaten her—and Huo Yuhao would most definitely disintegrate into pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Curse was about a foot away from Huo Yuhao, the Icy War God’s Armor started to release dark blue ripples. It was trying to radiate as much Ultimate Ice as possible to resist the Curse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no matter how strong a soul tool was, its user had to be strong enough to harness its potential!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A low humming sound could be heard from the Icy War God’s Armor. It was almost as though it was crying for its owner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A long and loud sigh could be heard from a position in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Huo Yuhao was thrown out of the way like a gunny sack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That streak of blue light that was merely inches away from his body did not manage to hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong floated silently in mid-air, as though she had already lost consciousness. The Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun which was behind her back had also disappeared. She closed her eyes and slept like a sleeping beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trident which was glistening with a brilliant golden glow was suspended before her. The Curse of the Ocean Heart landed directly on the tip of the trident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess’ strongest attack—which rivalled that of an Ultimate Douluo—was neutralized. The Princess’ jaw dropped as she watched the Ocean Heart, which was in her hand, disintegrate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An illusory hand formed on the pole of the trident as an illusory figure appeared out of thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the person was not in his actual physical form, he was instantly able to calm the entire Ice Sea when he appeared. There were no longer any ripples or waves in the entire ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had long blue hair that resembled a waterfall. His long hair that reached his feet was the backdrop for his mighty figure and broad shoulders. The man wore a majestic blue robe, which seemed to ripple like water. If one were to pay close attention to his robe, one would lose his or her soul in the depths of the dark blue of his robe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though his handsome face hinted that he was under thirty years old, he had a pair of sunken eyes that were very alluring. His eyes seemed to look empty, yet at the same time, they appeared to encompass everything in the universe. Occasionally, a flash of purple flickered across his eyes. It seemed to hint at the inevitable passing of beauty in our world, as well as the astounding truths of life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress, Ice Empress, Skydream Ice Worm, Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass, and the Ice Bear King had all become frozen in mid-air after the faint figure appeared. Their spirit forms were no longer able to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao, who had been tossed aside was also floating peacefully in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The daughter of the Princess started to tremble vigorously. She lowered her head and did not dare to even steal a glance at the figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The beautiful Princess of the Sea’s eyes widened as the scales on her gigantic fishtail suddenly curled up. She realized she had lost all connection with the sea. Her power was decreasing at an impossible rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was not overly concerned by that. Her attention had already been fully absorbed by the golden trident before her, as well as the illusory figure wielding it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yo-You are…” The Princess of the Sea’s voice trembled, not out of fear, but because of her excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t hurt them. Bring them to your little daughter, and they will help you. Don’t let hatred blind you.” The voice projected from the image was extremely gentle. However, in the ears of the Princess and her daughter, it was filled with authority.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The image gently raised the trident in his hand. Following which, the trident released an unparalleled golden light. Instantly, the entire Ice Sea turned golden as the golden light rippled within and across the water. Every single aquatic soul beast in the Ice Sea felt as though they had been purified spiritually. All of their negative emotions seemed to have vanished.</span></p>
