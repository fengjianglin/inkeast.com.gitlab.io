 <p><strong>Book 14: The Finals!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 119.2: Xu Sanshi Goes All-Out</strong></p>
 <p>He fought differently from other soul engineers. When the Heavenfiend Douluo signaled the start of the competition, he leapt towards Xu Sanshi like a bolt of lightning.</p>
 <p>He was too quick. In terms of speed, he was even faster than his elder brother. Huo Yuhao could only tell that Chen An was wielding a pair of short swords as his weapons even though he had his Spirit Eyes.</p>
 <p>The 100 meters between them seemed to be covered so easily. That bolt of lightning surged straight towards Xu Sanshi, and even the Heavenfiend Douluo had to be absolutely focused in preparation to end this round.</p>
 <p>The radiance from Xu Sanshi’s Milk Bottle had disappeared when his opponent dashed out. He lifted the heavy Xuanwu Shield and performed an action that didn’t seem related to the competition.</p>
 <p>He moved half a step to the right, and tilted the Xuanwu Shield at an angle. He also shut his eyes at this point and sealed his vision.</p>
 <p>“Dang—” A streak of advancing golden light grazed past the Xuanwu Shield and amidst a stream of sparks. After that, a series of explosions echoed from the Xuanwu Shield. The frightening explosive force was too much for Xu Sanshi, even though he had the Xuanwu Shield. He retreated a few steps rapidly, and only managed to stabilize after staggering a little.</p>
 <p>Yes, Chen An and Chen Fei were different. Chen Fei used his speed, as he was a speed-type long-range attacker, whereas Chen An was a close-combat soul engineer. He specialized in close-combat and attacked rapidly. A powerful assault-type close-combat soul tool, along with his extreme speed, made him stronger than an agility-type soul king.</p>
 <p>The pair of short swords in his hand had been molded by him 7 times. The short swords would become more powerful every time they were molded. He had made them Class 6 soul tools through all his effort. One sword had a flash effect, and was extremely quick, while the other sword could invoke a thunderstorm. Once struck by this sword, a thunderstorm would rage and strike the opponent. It would also create an opportunity for the other sword.</p>
 <p>It took Chen An less than a third of a second to slow his assault. In the next instant, he had already attacked Xu Sanshi like a bolt of lightning.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi started to shift his feet, and his small steps changed repeatedly. It appeared that his actions were out of tune with the oncoming bolt of lightning, but he was able to dodge behind the Xuanwu Shield.</p>
 <p>A close-combat soul engineer was offensively stronger than a long-distance soul engineer. While the soul tool rays and soul tool cannons looked very dazzling, only a close-combat soul tool could unleash the effects of a soul tool to its fullest.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi’s defense had reached a soul king’s standard with the Xuanwu Shield supporting him. However, he was still forced back by Chen An’s relentless attacks. He couldn’t even stand properly. A streak of flashing light left streaks and streaks of shrilling sparks. Bolts and bolts of lightning brought booming, reverberating sounds with them.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi was in great jeopardy now. He was at risk of perishing under the pulsating bolts of lightning.</p>
 <p>He was getting closer to the edge of the stage. If this continued, Xu Sanshi would certainly be forced off the stage even if he could resist Chen An’s attacks.</p>
 <p>However, Chen An changed the direction of his attacks at this point. Xu Sanshi had to retreat laterally because of this.</p>
 <p>“Rascal, what’re you doing?” The Sun Moon team’s teacher could not help but scold furiously. Chen An was on the verge of victory earlier!</p>
 <p>“He wants to take revenge for Chen Fei. This fellow…” Ma Rulong was a little annoyed as he shut his eyes. What else could he say? If it were him, what would he do?</p>
 <p>Chen An didn’t force Xu Sanshi off the stage, as he wanted more time to attack. He wanted to find a loophole and kill him.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi was forced to retreat laterally. He was staggering now, and could be killed at anytime.</p>
 <p>The Heavenfiend Douluo was experienced, and could tell Chen An’s motive.</p>
 <p>“Boom—"</p>
 <p>An explosion rang from the Xuanwu Shield. Xu Sanshi’s hands also trembled a little, and he staggered backwards quickly. He wanted to use his soul skill to make up for his shortfall, but Chen An’s speed increased to its peak at this instant. Chen An’s flashing sword stabbed towards Xu Sanshi rapidly.</p>
 <p>The Heavenfiend Douluo hesitated for a while. He could tell that Xu Sanshi was unable to dodge this blow, but he saw Xu Sanshi’s Xuanwu Shield lighting up too.</p>
 <p>He could end this round if he made his move, but he couldn’t determine the victor. That was why he hesitated. He didn’t strike with the hand he lifted, as he didn’t want to influence the result.</p>
 <p>“Psht—” The flashing sword stabbed into Xu Sanshi’s chest. Intense lightning flashed across his chest, and his entire person seemed to be coated with a layer of lightning.</p>
 <p>“No—!” Below the stage, the critically injured Jiang Nannan sat up. She let out a sorrowful groan, then spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
 <p>How could Xu Sanshi not hear that? His eyes were filled with resolve initially, but a shred of comfort appeared when he heard that sorrowful groan.</p>
 <p>The lightning that spread across his body was the effect caused by the flashing sword. As the sword stabbed into his body, the flashing lightning surged in his entire body and could even tear it apart.</p>
 <p>Chen An was delighted when he managed to stab Xu Sanshi successfully. He muttered to himself, “Elder brother, I’ve avenged you.”</p>
 <p>However, his smile stiffened up at this point.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi’s body was covered on flashing lightning, but there were too many bolts of lightning on his body. Just as Chen An was stunned in place, a gentle ripple undulated, and Xu Sanshi’s tough Xuanwu Shield softened. It turned into rippling water that engulfed his body internally.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi had been waiting for this moment for too long. Against a close-combat soul engineer, his Mysterious Underworld Displacement was useless. Bringing his opponent close to him would only enable his opponent to increase his frequency of attacks. The Mysterious Underworld Quake couldn’t even quake at a speed that matched up to the opponent’s rate of attack. That was why he could only wait for an opportunity to arrive.</p>
 <p>Did Xu Sanshi slip up just now? No, of course not. He had intentionally revealed a crack in his defenses. That was because he could clearly sense that he was unable to hold on, as his soul power was depleting quickly and his opponent was attacking him relentlessly. He had no chance to wait any further, thus he needed to take a risk.</p>
 <p>The Xuanwu Shield turned into a ball of black watery light that engulfed Chen An precisely. In the next instant, a huge illusory Xuanwu Shield appeared behind Xu Sanshi</p>
