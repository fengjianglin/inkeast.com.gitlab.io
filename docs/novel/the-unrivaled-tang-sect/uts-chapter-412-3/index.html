 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao calmly replied, “I remember you mentioning before that that one didn’t count. It was part of your test for me. After that, I was seriously hurt because of your test. I had no choice but to use the water from the Blazing Sunspring to warm my blood and pluck that Yearning Heartbroken Grass. In fact, I only took one stalk of Yearning Heartbroken Grass. The other stalk was taken by Qiu’er in order to save me. It shouldn’t be counted. This is why taking five types of plants this time is already considered less than what I’m entitled to. I should leave with six types of plants instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How, how can you be like this?” The Delicate Silk Immortal was immediately furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s soul rings slowly rose from his feet, and the sixth soul ring that Wang Qiu’er had given him appeared. The moment it appeared, all the soul beasts were shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “You You, Qiu’er sacrificed herself for me in order to save me. I’m sure you know who she is. This means that I’ve inherited her power of destiny. I’m not an unreasonable person, but I really need to leave with some valuable plants today. Among all these plants, I’ll first need you to follow me. If you aren’t willing, I can take away just your destiny.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, what are you saying? You want to take me away? No, no way. That’s impossible. I’m not leaving this place. You can’t eat me! I’m useless to you!” The Delicate Silk Immortal instantly panicked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Huo Yuhao mentioned, they were more afraid of Wang Qiu’er than the entire Great Star Dou Forest. This was because the Icefire Yin Yang Well was one of the places in the world where destiny congregated. It was also the reason why this place looked so magical. If the destiny of this place was ruined, the Icefire Yin Yang Well would be damaged. When that happened, all the plants here would be doomed. If they left the Icefire Yin Yang Well, they wouldn’t be able to grow as fast as they did now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “You don’t have a say in this matter. I’m leaving with you. I’m not violating any restrictions that ancestor Tang San came up with. You are also one of the plants here, right?” As he spoke, he was already slowly walking towards the Delicate Silk Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, don’t! Don’t take me away. I can only curb all sorts of poison. You possess the strength of Ultimate Ice, which means that you aren’t afraid of lethal poisons anyway! Bringing me away won’t do you any good!” The Delicate Silk Immortal was extremely anxious right now. She wasn’t adept at fighting either, and had no chance of resisting Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the lack of unity between the plant-type soul beasts was demonstrated. Every one of them was scared of being taken away by Huo Yuhao, and didn’t dare to make a sound. Naturally, they didn’t come to You You’s aid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last time Huo Yuhao was here, he had activated the Snow Empress’ help. Given how strong the Snow Empress was, these soul beasts weren’t able to resist her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao only stopped when he reached the pink halo that the Delicate Silk Immortal released from her body. Bei Bei, who followed behind him, could smell the refreshing fragrance, and was jolted awake immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked thoughtful, and said, “You seem to be right. I don’t really need you to neutralize any poison. Let’s do it this way: help me locate one type of plant. If I’m satisfied, I’ll consider letting you off.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao took out the scroll that Bei Bei had drawn for him before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright, I’ll help you. There’s no plant that I can’t recognize in this world.” You You was delighted, and immediately agreed to Huo Yuhao’s request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t stop, and directly opened the scroll before presenting it to You You.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you see it? You are actually included in this scroll. It’s not a lie when I said that I wanted to leave with you. Tell me what the other plant is, and I’ll consider letting you remain here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the start, Huo Yuhao had already set this trap for the Delicate Silk Immortal. These plant-type soul beasts were very clever. He might not get an answer if he asked directly. He also didn’t have time to slowly get an answer out of them. He had no choice but to threaten them in order to find out what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I recognize what plant this is. However, can you really not leave with me if I tell you what it is? How can you guarantee that?” The Delicate Silk Immortal was indeed clever. She immediately stated her condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t make a sound. He lifted his right hand and his Ice Empress’ Pincer was instantly unleashed. He immediately grabbed onto her, and a streak of rose-gold light shot out from his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was one of the two soul skills from his sixth soul ring, Destiny’s Demise. Once struck by this Destiny’s Demise, all defenses that weren’t formed using soul power would lose their effect. One’s body would also become extremely fragile. Under the guidance of destiny, it was impossible not to be struck by it. Unless one’s soul power attack could directly destroy Huo Yuhao, his Destiny’s Demise would last for a full minute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah! No, I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you, okay?!” the Delicate Silk Immortal immediately screamed wildly after being struck by the Destiny’s Demise. He didn’t give her a chance to play any tricks at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s hand stopped in mid-air, and he said coldly, “Given your abilities, your life energy won’t dissipate any time soon even if I pluck you and leave. I can still slowly interrogate you even after we leave with you. So, you can choose to answer me here, or answer me after we leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll, I’ll tell you. I need to sense that plant you’re referring to. I can’t see your scroll. After all, I’m only just a plant. Can you describe what it looks like?” You You was trembling as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s lips twisted a little. Bei Bei, who originally had some sympathy for her, also turned cold when he heard her words. She was simply too cunning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao twisted his head to Bei Bei and said, “Eldest senior, can you show her what it looks like?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley had given Bei Bei three opportunities to present the image, which included the aura of the two plants as shown in the image. This was also why You You was much larger than what she looked like in the image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei acknowledged his words and shut his eyes. An illusory streak of light appeared in the air under his mental control. The appearances and auras of two different types of plants were presented in the form of projections in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, the Delicate Silk Immortal didn’t dare to delay any more. She was certain that Huo Yuhao would really lay his hands on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rings of pinkish light started to spread from her head as she sensed the projections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief moment, the projections vanished, and everything returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So?” Huo Yuhao asked. Although Bei Bei was very anxious now, he didn’t make a sound, and let Huo Yuhao do all the talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Weird. It’s very small and weak, but it’s very strong.” The Delicate Silk Immortal seemed to be in deep thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t try any tricks,” Huo Yuhao said coldly, “Otherwise, I’ll bring you to another place and let you think over it slowly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal rushed to say, “No, no! Ah! I’ve figured it out. I know what it is. It’s small and weak because of its size, but it’s strong because it comes from that species. It’s the Bluesilver Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bluesilver Emperor? What’s that?” Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei were both lost when they heard the Delicate Silk Immortal mention this name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal quickly said, “The Bluesilver Emperor is the emperor of Bluesilver Grasses. It’s the strongest Bluesilver Grass. While Bluesilver Grass looks small and weak, their emperor is extremely strong. The Bluesilver Emperor is also a true, hundred-thousand-year soul beast. I know what’s going on. Your friend must be poisoned, and needs my abilities to neutralize her poison before the Bluesilver Emperor can help her Awaken by guiding the strength of her bloodline. Your friend’s martial soul should be a Bluesilver Grass.”</span></p>

Tang Ya’s martial soul was a Bluesilver Grass. The Delicate Silk Immortal’s analysis was on point. If this was the case, she really had hope.</span></p>

You just need to bring her and the Bluesilver Emperor here. I’m sure I can neutralize her poison, but I won’t be able to remove it from her body. I have no way of doing so if the source of the poison is deep within her body. I can’t remove poison from a person’s blood. I can only neutralize the poison in her body after the Bluesilver Emperor forces it out of her blood.”</span></p>

He’s a hundred-thousand-year soul beast. Only a hundred-thousand-year Bluesilver Grass can become an emperor.”</span></p>

You’ve never left this Icefire Yin Yang Well. It’s logical that you don’t know. I’ll bring you out of here and we can neutralize the poison when we see him.”</span></p>

If you bring him here, he’ll be delighted, considering this is a place suitable for plant growth. He’ll help you then. If I leave this place, I’ll wither quickly. How will I be able to help the both of you if that happens? Leave me here. As long as you bring the Bluesilver Emperor here, I’ll help to neutralize your friend’s poison any time. Will that do?”</span></p>
