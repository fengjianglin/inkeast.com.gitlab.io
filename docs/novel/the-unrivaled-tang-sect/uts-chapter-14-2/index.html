 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 14.2: Skydream Points</strong></p>
 <p><em>Am I dead? Am I going to die like this?</em> In this moment, when death was approaching, the feeling that he had in his heart wasn’t unwillingness. Everything that had happened had really been too sudden. Hence, he was only at a loss at the moment.</p>
 <p>The scene before his eyes suddenly became clear. Huo Yuhao saw a strange scene: He saw himself…</p>
 <p>If Wang Dong were still awake now right, he’d have seen an incomparably shocking scene.</p>
 <p>In the moment that Huo Yuhao was about to be engulfed by that flaming hand, the colour of his eyes suddenly changed. His dark blue eyes—which had been twinkling with a faint golden light—suddenly became as white as twinkling frost in an instant.</p>
 <p>A gust of extraordinarily cold air suddenly spread outwards from Huo Yuhao’s body. He actually managed to forcibly disperse all of the heat coming from the figure in front of him. The fiery figure only let out a dull groan before curling up as they collapsed to the ground.</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao was utilising his Spirit Eyes, the soul ring that rose up from beneath his feet was white. However, at this moment, his normally white soul ring had actually turned an incomparably brilliant golden colour. A glaring golden light sparkled off of it, just like the morning sun was rising up from beneath his feet.</p>
 <p>With Huo Yuhao’s body as the core, the area around him—and a hundred metre diameter of him—instantly turned into a world of ice and snow. Even his opponent’s spiritual sea was frozen.</p>
 <p>The red figure seemed to be shivering violently, as the terrifying intimidating aura it let off was continuously condensed by the cold. Huo Yuhao slowly raised his right arm. It wasn’t known when his right hand’s index finger had turned ice-blue, nor when his eyes had begun to shine with a white light. A gloomy voice immediately rang out.</p>
 <p>“You dare to touch the person that this Brother has chosen, and dare to disturb this Brother’s sleep! Go and die!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao pointed forwards with his index finger, causing an icy-blue ray of light to suddenly flash in the sky, headed straight for the red figure.</p>
 <p>The temperature surrounding the red figure plummeted as a result of the extremely chilling feeling Huo Yuhao was emitting. Perhaps because it felt danger approaching it, the red figure struggled violently. Closely following that, the loud and clear cry of a phoenix abruptly rang out.</p>
 <p>An enormous phoenix floated up from beneath the figure, along with six soul rings—two yellow, two purple and two black. Soul Emperor rank!</p>
 <p>Among the six soul rings, the second, third, and sixth soul rings all shone at the same time. The flame behind the figure turned dark red almost instantly. A thread of fire that was as thin as a finger was spouted from the phoenix’s mouth, colliding with the ice-blue light that had been shot out of Huo Yuhao’s index finger.</p>
 <p>“Chi chi——” A series of strange sounds rang out. The thread of fire collapsed almost instantly. The enormous phoenix abruptly pounced forwards, using its huge body to shield the red figure from the front.</p>
 <p>The fiery red figure rolled back along with the violent cry of the fire phoenix and, with an icy-blue layer covering them from head to toe, they immediately dropped straight into Sea God Lake in the distance.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was just about to pursue and attack them, but halted his steps for a moment. The sound that had previously rung out rang once more. “How annoying, someone else came. Huh, this small guy’s physical fitness has improved very quickly! It seems that I can give him a bit more power already. Alright, I’m fleeing.”</p>
 <p>The golden soul ring rapidly dulled back to a white soul ring and disappeared. All of the coldness in Huo Yuhao’s surroundings also disappeared seemingly instantly. The water in the lake rapidly reverted back to its original state. Huo Yuhao’s white eyes that had been emitting a strong chill reverted back to normal. Finally, his body went limp, causing him to fall to the ground in exhaustion.</p>
 <p>Sea God Lake had just had frightening soulforce fluctuations a moment ago, but tranquility had already been completely restored. Only Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were left, collapsed and unconscious by the shore.</p>
 <p>In the distance, more than ten silhouettes were headed straight for them from the depths of Sea God Lake at an astonishing speed. It only took a couple seconds for them to arrive at the shore.</p>
 <p>“This is bad. Students from the outer courtyard were injured.” A white-clothed old man was the one leading the group. He suddenly strode over in mid-air and, as if he’d just teleported through space, arrived at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s side. He extended both his hands, and both of their bodies immediately floated upwards.</p>
 <p>“Fortunately, it seems that they’ve only fainted. They haven’t sustained any injuries. Teacher Li, please provide them with some medical treatment.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Another white-clothed middle-aged person hastily stepped forwards, taking charge of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. If Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were still conscious, they would’ve immediately recognised this Teacher Li aas the Soul Sage-ranked master who’d utilised his martial soul—The Tree of Life—on them yesterday, and had conducted a full-scale recovery on the entire class.</p>
 <p>His soul rings quickly rose up, and hoops of green light revolved around Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s bodies, quietly infiltrating their bodies. A miraculous scene appeared: The wilted plants in their surroundings had actually started to rapidly recover at an astonishing speed. One could also faintly see that the large-scale vegetation that surrounded the Sea God Lake was emitting faint green rays of light. These faint green rays of light were surging towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s bodies, slowly soaking into them.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Tao is over here.”</p>
 <p>The crashing sound of water rang out, and a white-clothed person fished out the figure clad in red who’d previously fallen into Sea God Lake.</p>
 <p>The person clad in red was already drenched from head to toe, revealing a lithe and graceful figure. Looking at the figure’s appearance, the person actually seemed to be a woman.</p>
 <p>The white-clothed old man went around to her side. He pressed her right hand to his shoulder and could see that rich white soulforce was surging into the woman’s body at an astonishing speed.</p>
 <p>“Strange!” The white-clothed old man furrowed his brow, as if there was something that he couldn’t understand.</p>
 <p>“Teacher Li, what’s the situation with these two students from the outer courtyard?” He turned his head and asked the teacher who was currently treating Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>The person known as Teacher Li said, “It’s nothing serious. They’ll be waking up very soon.”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed old man heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Thank goodness we didn’t make a serious mistake. It seems that Xiao Tao still managed to retain some of her consciousness. Teacher Li, send these two students back and repeatedly warn them to forget what they saw. If they divulge this matter to others, they’ll be expelled. Give them a high grade as compensation. We’re heading back.”</p>
 <p>The last three words were directed towards the others. He carried the woman clad in red, and as his silhouette flickered, he turned into a ray of white light as he headed towards the depths of Sea God Lake.</p>
 <p>In the moment that Huo Yuhao fainted and fell to the ground, he was no longer able to see anything on the outside with his consciousness. Naturally, he also didn’t know what happened after he fainted either.</p>
 <p>“You managed to disturb Elder Brother’s sleep so quickly! How annoying!” The Skydream Iceworm’s voice resounded in Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao dazedly asked, “Brother Skydream, you were the one who made that move just now?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm replied, “Of course it was this brother who did it! If not, you would’ve already become a dried up, baked person! That person’s fire attribute is truly very strong; she actually possesses the blood of a Phoenix Godbeast! If not, this Brother’s finger would’ve annihilated her. But, no matter. She should’ve lost consciousness already. That flame of hers seems to be slightly demonic. However, this Brother didn’t eat all that ten thousand year Ice Pith for nothing. Her powers are still far from comparable to mine. Little Yuhao, your cultivation has been very successful. Your physical fitness has increased significantly. The first seal of the ten seals that I left in your body has already been cracked open.”</p>
