 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light changed once again as everything seemed to have returned to normal. Huo Yuhao brought Ju Zi out of the huge black door as they returned to her tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi turned around and took a last glimpse at the mystical sight behind her. Even now, she was still slightly startled by the experience she had just had. “So this is your deepest secret that you have been hiding from everyone?” she asked gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao did not answer. All he did was stare at her as complex emotions overwhelmed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi continued, “You’re still too kind. You had a great opportunity to kill me just now—or at the very least imprison me. Actually, I was not completely truthful earlier. If I am not around, the army might just attack Shrek City. However, with the power that all of you possess, you will still have a good chance of surviving our attacks. As long as you are able to withstand the first wave of attacks, you might just stand a chance at defeating us. However, you have just let this chance slip away. Now that I am back here, there’s no way you can catch me again as long as I choose not to allow you to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “I know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s eyes widened in disbelief, and she asked, “Then why did you send me back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I couldn’t make up my mind. You’re right. I am just too kind. However, I hope that you will never challenge my limits again. You should not be overly confident about your abilities either. If I really have to kill you someday, you will never be able to run away from me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi revealed a smile on her face. It seemed as though she was not worried in the slightest about Huo Yuhao’s threatening words. “If you really have this capability, you should kill that man first. If you kill him, I will adhere to our ten-year promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted his eyes as multiple thoughts fleeted across his mind. He knew it was somewhat against his conscience to kill Ju Zi. However, he had no psychological barrier when it came to killing that man. Nonetheless, would he really be that easy to kill? Huo Yuhao knew he had to take down the entire Imperial Soul Engineer Legion in Radiant City in order to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll take my leave.” Huo Yuhao waved his hand at Ju Zi before beginning to fade into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was a little frustrated by his response as she suddenly spoke, “I will tell you who my target is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” Huo Yuhao, who was about to leave the tent, suddenly stopped and reappeared. He turned around and stared at Ju Zi in disbelief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi stood up and walked towards Huo Yuhao. “Yuhao, believe it or not, I only called you and promised to tell you this secret because I wanted to see you once more before you leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was startled by her words. As he sensed her affection for him, his mind turned into a complete mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My target is the Dou Ling Empire. You probably could have guessed it as well. You were just unsure if your guess was correct, that’s all.” Ju Zi smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at her and nodded. Following which, his body flickered as he vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi stood where she was as a faint smile appeared on her face. It was as though Huo Yuhao had never left her. It was only after a good long while that the smile on her face faded away. Following which, she was back to her usual professional self as she returned to her commander’s seat. Afterward, she reactivated the spiritual barrier she had shut down as she started to ponder something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the Commander’s Tent, Huo Yuhao soared up into the sky. Every single detection wave and fluctuation from the surrounding surveillance soul tools was instantly tricked by his Imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He only stopped when he reached an altitude of five thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around to look at the huge Sun Moon Empire camp beneath him. Huo Yuhao was a little disappointed in himself for not having the determination to deal with Ju Zi once and for all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though she behaved in a gentle manner in front of him, Huo Yuhao could sense how scary she was. From the start till the end, he did not manage to seize the initiative in their interaction. Ju Zi had delicately used every weakness in his heart to her advantage. It was truly frightening to see such a woman as your enemy’s commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, she was not called the War God Empress for nothing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt that the scariest part about Ju Zi was how she had only spoken the truth. Her rigorous analysis of her schemes and how her opponents would react had forced him to dismiss any ideas of imprisoning her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would definitely be more challenging to fend off an enraged Sun Moon Empire led by the Holy Ghost Church than to handle a calm and collected Ju Zi. Shrek City could not afford to be involved in a head-on clash like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, Ju Zi had a good grasp of what was on his mind. She knew where his limits lay, and how Huo Yuhao would definitely let her go after she revealed to him that she would never attack Shrek City. She had also accurately predicted that Huo Yuhao would believe her without any doubt. Perhaps this was because she had shut off the spiritual barrier and put down her defenses before him. She knew Huo Yuhao would never attack her after she did all of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air high up in the sky was extremely refreshing. After his short pause in the air, Huo Yuhao sped back to Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Elder Xuan had said, the only thing he could do after failing to convince the Elders in Shrek Academy was to stop Ju Zi’s operations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to Shrek City, Huo Yuhao headed straight for the military drill ground. Following which, he opened the Spectral Gate to release the three soul engineer legions back into their own respective training areas. At the same time, they brought out huge amounts of resources and rations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These resources were sufficient for Shrek City to set up multiple soul tool deployment areas within the city. With the addition of the three soul engineer legions, Shrek City’s defenses would definitely be improved tremendously. They would even be able to hold off the Sun Moon Empire’s all-out attack for an extended period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing all of these things, the sun had started to rise. Huo Yuhao headed back to the Tang Sect instead of returning to the Academy. He had already given instructions for the leaders within the soul engineer legions to submit their reports on the progress of their tasks at the military drill ground to the Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was surprised to learn that Bei Bei and Tang Wutong had already returned to the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not care about disrupting their rest as he dashed to his room to look for Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, how did it go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though dawn was only barely breaking, Tang Wutong was able to leap out of her bed to hug Huo Yuhao right after she was woken up. That was the responsiveness of a Titled Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning, she had heard about Huo Yuhao from the others. Even though the others might not be entirely sure what he had done, Tang Wutong had no trouble guessing what Huo Yuhao did while she was away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, she was clear that he had sent her away so as to prevent her from influencing his decision. If she was around, she would have definitely not allowed him to cultivate his second soul core with the Yin Yang Complement technique at this critical time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang!” The power of the seal was absolutely frightening. While Tang Wutong was hugging Huo Yuhao tightly, Huo Yuhao was not spared by the seal. The seal forced him away from Tang Wutong and threw him across the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was forced into the wall before he slid down and landed on the floor. He was exasperated to discover how powerful his future father-in-law’s seal was. The seal was actually able to adjust its power based on his current strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he now possessed two soul cores, he still felt a lot of pain after being tossed aside by the seal. At this instant, Huo Yuhao started to question how powerful his future father-in-law exactly was. His seal was so powerful that it could adjust its power based on the other person’s ability. It was important to note that Huo Yuhao could even flee successfully from an Ultimate Douluo. However, he stood no chance against the seal at all. He had thought that he would be able to hug Wutong properly now, but it seemed like he was still a long way from being able to do that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong let out a cold grunt and said, “I hugged you because I was very worried about you. But you deserve to be tossed aside by the seal. How dare you attempt to force a breakthrough when I’m not around? Have you ever considered my feelings? What should I do if you had failed?” As she spoke, her eyes started to turn red as tears welled up in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Tang Wutong sniffed a few times before racing forward to Huo Yuhao. She picked him up before sniffing his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shit!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao started to panic, but he ensured that his anxiety did not show on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Explain.” Tang Wutong let out a burst of cold laughter as she crossed her arms in front of her chest. He could see the rage within the violet pupils of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart skipped a beat as he tried to squeeze out a reply. “Weren’t we talking about serious matters? How did it go with the Dou Ling Empire? Any news from them? Did they listen to what you had to say? Did you manage to find the Heavenly Sun Douluo?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pouted and said, “I managed to find the Heavenly Sun Douluo and passed your message to him. But it was apparent that they were not persuaded by my words. In fact, elite troops from the Dou Ling Empire are already on their way to Shrek City. They should be here by tomorrow at the latest. When I reached their empire, they had already dispatched their elite troops. They had sent four soul master legions and two hundred troops in total.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao facepalmed and exclaimed, “Shit! Ju Zi’s planning to attack Dou Ling Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Tang Wutong showed a serious expression as she asked, “Explain yourself. Why is there a perfumed scent on your body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed as he lowered his head and started sharing how he had planned to abduct Ju Zi, but ended up being persuaded by her. He did not dare to hide anything from Tang Wutong. After all, her big round eyes seemed as though they could see through any of his lies—even if they were white lies. Hence, he decided that it was better for him to be truthful than to be caught lying. After all, that would be detrimental for their relationship. On top of that, Huo Yuhao did not think he had been unfaithful towards her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was visibly angrier after hearing his explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you hugged just because she asked you to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I only hugged her shoulders lightly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s still wrong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t believe how unreasonable women become once they’re jealous!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So what if I’m unreasonable? Go and find her if you want. Who knows? She might order her troops to retreat if you promise to marry her. In fact, they might even turn around and overthrow Xu Tianran. You would have effectively saved all of us!” Tang Wutong replied sarcastically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “Alright, I was wrong. I will definitely bring you along the next time I look for her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must be punished if you have done something wrong.” Tang Wutong glared coldly at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I need to be punished? I have already admitted that I was wrong.” Huo Yuhao looked at her with innocent eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong suddenly pounced on him and gave him a deep and intense kiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes widened as a warm and beautiful sensation traveled straight into his brain. His mind immediately went completely blank. Even his Yin Ying Complement soul cores seemed to be powerless in this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, it was needless to say that he ended up in the wall again.</span></p>
