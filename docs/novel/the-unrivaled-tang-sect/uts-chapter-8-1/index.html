 <p><strong>Book 2:&nbsp;Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 8.1:&nbsp;Monstrous Teacher</strong></p>
 <p>Shrek Academy occupied an extremely large area. Large areas of vacant land separated the buildings from one another. After Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had exited the dormitory, Wang Dong continued until he stood firmly within one of the empty spaces outside the dormitory, then turned around and beckoned Huo Yuhao towards him by curling his finger.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s heart was still burning with fury, but he didn’t immediately rush towards Wang Dong in anger. After undergoing a life-and-death experience in the Great Star Dou Forest, he’d learned one thing at the very least, which was to stay calm no matter what.</p>
 <p>That old man who’d been leaning on the chair at the dormitory’s entrance raised his head slightly. A gleam of curiosity flashed through his faint yellow eyes as he gazed at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong with interest.</p>
 <p>A faint golden light flashed through Huo Yuhao’s eyes, and a white soul ring subsequently rose from his feet, activating his Spirit Eyes.</p>
 <p>Seeing his “ten year soul ring” Wang Dong let out a soft laugh. “I’m very curious as to how you managed to enter this school. You dare to challenge me with just this bit of skill? I won’t even have to use my martial soul to deal with you.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the tip of Wang Dong’s left foot tapped the ground. His body was like an arrow as he charged towards Huo Yuhao. Not only was he fast, but appeared as if there was also an abnormal agility hidden inside his movement. He arrived before Huo Yuhao in the blink of an eye, and raised his right leg to kick him in the chest.</p>
 <p>With this raise of Wang Dong’s leg, only Huo Yuhao was able to make out that Wang Dong had a pair of legs that exceeded the proportion of a normal person’s. Before he realized it, the leg had already arrived in front of him.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Huo Yuhao moved. He rapidly took one step to the right whilst simultaneously using his left hand to push Wang Dong’s foot away.</p>
 <p>“Hmm?” Wang Dong clearly hadn’t expected Huo Yuhao to be able to dodge his swift kick. He drew back the right leg he’d used to step out with in a flash, and dodged Huo Yuhao’s left hand. At the same time, he shot out another kick lightning-like speed, this time aimed towards Huo Yuhao's neck.</p>
 <p>It was as if Huo Yuhao could foresee Wang Dong’s actions. When Wang Dong shot his leg out, Huo Yuhao simultaneously lowered his body and crouched down. In the next instant, his body bounced back up, and his right shoulder just happened to collide with the lower portion of Wang Dong’s thigh.</p>
 <p>Both of their movements were very quick. From an outsider’s point of view, it looked like Wang Dong had purposely sent his leg upwards such that Huo Yuhao could use his shoulder to push it up further.</p>
 <p>It had to be said that Wang Dong’s body was extremely strong. A normal person would’ve had their center of balance destabilized after having their thigh pushed up like that. However, Wang Dong’s right leg was instead actually raised up over him, as he did a split. His left leg was still firmly planted on the ground.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt a burst of both softness and elasticity from the shoulder he’d used to bump into Wang Dong’s thigh with. He didn’t let Wang Dong regain the upper hand as he rapidly charged forwards, immediately ramming into Wang Dong in an attempt to take advantage of him while he was still standing on one leg.</p>
 <p>Facing Huo Yuhao, who’d been dogging his heels till this point, Wang Dong made an astonishing movement. His right leg was still raised up in the air as he shockingly continued to move it upwards behind him, along with the upper half of his body. At the same time, his left leg shot out towards Huo Yuhao. In that moment, the width at which his legs were spread out had already completely exceeded the limits that normal people were capable of imagining.</p>
 <p>Although Huo Yuhao had relied on his Spirit Eyes’ spiritual detection skill to accurately ascertain Wang Dong's previous attacks, he’d already moved. Thus, he wasn't able to withdraw even though he’d sensed Wang Dong's movements.</p>
 <p>One was bound to have a certain amount of advantage over their opponent when they could anticipate their opponent’s movements. When Huo Yuhao saw that Wang Dong’s left leg had sprung up towards his chin, both of Huo Yuhao’s hands simultaneously made a downwards pressing motion, colliding with his left leg.</p>
 <p>“Bang——” Wang Dong’s strength was exceptional. His leg carried a powerful vibration that was difficult to describe. Huo Yuhao felt a burst of numbness from both of his palms, causing him to subconsciously activate the Mysterious Jade Hands technique. Despite him doing so, he still ended up staggering back in retreat.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s right leg that had fallen backwards only touched the ground lightly before his left leg that had been lifted up landed on the ground again, causing his whole body to flip over once again. Wang Dong’s right leg resembled a whip as it went straight down towards Huo Yuhao’s shoulder with a whooshing sound. He was evidently infuriated that Huo Yuhao had previously pushed his thigh up.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao, who was in the process of retreating, reacted the instant Wang Dong’s right leg touched the ground, bouncing backwards. Huo Yuhao’s footsteps suddenly became quick, and with a sway of his figure, he rapidly headed towards Wang Dong’s left side, getting out of the way of her strike.</p>
 <p>“Bang——” Wang Dong’s right leg that had whipped downwards hit the ground ferociously. He actually left a shallow footprint on the hard stone ground. Following closely after that, his whole body became like a windmill as he charged towards Huo Yuhao. Both of his legs were like two maces as he unleashed an attack akin to like howling winds and torrential rains in Huo Yuhao’s direction.</p>
 <p>Despite the surprise he’d received after going through their previous confrontation, Huo Yuhao had calmed down at this moment. He activated his Spiritual Detection ability in an area around him, and calmly determined every single one of Wang Dong’s attacks in advance. Under Wang Dong’s fierce attacks, the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks that he knew very little about was like a small boat that was battered on the left and right, yet refused to capsize.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was also becoming more and more apprehensive as he fought with Huo Yuhao. He could clearly sense that Huo Yuhao’s strength was far worse than his own. Regardless of whether it was his speed or strength, all of them were completely inferior to his own. However, his attacks still weren’t able to land on Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao wasn’t quick, yet he was always able to clearly discern his movements beforehand, and was thereby able to effectively evade his attacks. Wang Dong had already attempted to make a feint, but had still been unable to deceive his opponent.</p>
 <p>Not only was Wang Dong arrogant, he was extremely stubborn too. Since they’d agreed to not use their martial soul, he definitely wouldn’t use his. He could only continue to intensify his attacks, not believing that Huo Yuhao could continue to persevere.</p>
 <p>Indeed, Huo Yuhao had already reached the point of being unable to persevere for much longer. Not only were the attacks from Wang Dong’s legs powerful to the point that he almost couldn’t withstand them, but the speed at which he attacked was also unusually fast. He could only barely contend against Wang Dong while relying on his Spiritual Detection, under the condition that he was fully concentrated on the fight. However, as time passed, the disparity between the basic structures of their bodies gradually appeared.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had lived an arduous life since his childhood, and was malnourished. As such, the nourishment that the Mysterious Heaven Technique had provided to his body with had also just begun. Compared to Wang Dong, who had deep-rooted fundamentals, he was far worse in terms of his body’s development. Even though he’d utilised his martial soul, and even though Wang Dong still hadn’t, the nourishment that his soulforce provided was solely in regards to his internals. After they’d fought for a long time, it was inevitable that minute mistakes would emerge on Huo Yuhao’s end. Both of Wang Dong’s legs had only accurately swept at his side a few times, but his body was already experiencing a scorching pain. The Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks that he knew very little about had also started to become messy, and he became more and more passive.</p>
 <p><em>This won’t do. If things continue on in this manner, I’ll definitely lose.</em> Huo Yuhao retreated as fast as he could, as soon, he wouldn’t be able to keep avoiding Wang Dong’s attacks.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he raised his head without notice. Since this movement was quite large, Wang Dong also subconsciously looked at his face. He clearly saw a hint of purple flashed through both of Huo Yuhao’s eyes. Immediately following this, Wang Dong felt like his brain had been pricked by a needle and, with a sharp pain, his mind momentarily became blank.</p>
 <p>How could Huo Yuhao let this kind of opportunity slip by? He suddenly pounced forwards with a large stride forwards. He leapt up, and both of his arms wrapped tightly around both of Wang Dong’s arms. Both of his legs then wound themselves around Wang Dong’s waist, forcibly knocking him to the ground.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong had always used his legs when commencing his attacks. At this moment, Huo Yuhao was quite anxious. With his legs wrapped around Wang Dong's waist, how could he exert any force? As long as he continued to subdue Wang Dong, everything would be fine. Huo Yuhao could only subdue him and hope that everything would be fine.</p>
 <p>The stabbing pain in his brain caused Wang Dong to tightly furrow his eyebrows. However, that only lasted for a couple seconds before he became clear-headed once again. Nevertheless, Huo Yuhao had already knocked his body to the ground. His waist was tightly locked between Huo Yuhao’s legs, and his arms were also bound by Huo Yuhao. The distance that separated their faces was no more than an inch, and they could hear each other’s breathing.</p>
