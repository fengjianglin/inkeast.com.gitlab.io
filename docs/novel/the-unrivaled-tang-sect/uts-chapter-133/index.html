 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Scorching dragon flames were unleashed by her first soul ring ability Dragonfire. At the same time, she unleashed her Dragonfury soul skill. This caused Wu Feng to look like a ferociously burning piece of coal.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was expressionless as he went to face Wu Feng’s charge head on. His right hand slapped forward quickly, the Ice Empress’ Pincer active again.</p>
 <p>This seemingly simple palm strike produced a myriad of changes as it approached Wu Feng. While Wu Feng was somewhat impulsive, she was still akin to a weaker version of Ma Xiaotao; her wits weren’t lacking despite her recklessness. Much to her horror however, she realized that she couldn’t dodge Huo Yuhao’s palm strike no matter what she did. Thus, she sent a punch towards Huo Yuhao’s right palm with both of her hands in order to block his strike.</p>
 <p>Something strange happened when she did so; Huo Yuhao’s palm suddenly disappeared, causing her fists to hit nothing but air. After her fists had lost their power, Huo Yuhao’s palm re-appeared out of nowhere and struck her fists.</p>
 <p>“Psshh——”</p>
 <p>The sound that rang out was akin to a red hot coal being thrown into a basin of ice water. Steam rose up from her body, while the red glow from Wu Feng’s body retreated at a shocking speed. As things were, she couldn’t use her third soul skill now even if she wanted to.</p>
 <p>A streak of golden light flashed and struck her from the side, sending her flying. This second strike had been unleashed by Wang Dong. He’d attacked Wu Feng and Dai Huabin in different manners. This was only a competition after all, which was why he hadn’t used his Guillotine Wing on Wu Feng.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao turned his head and a purplish-golden radiance shone brightly from his eyes. An almost tangible ray of light flashed from his pupils before disappearing. Not far from Huo Yuhao, Zhu Lu screamed in horror and collapsed to the ground, fresh blood flowing from her mouth and nose.</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin’s hopes of unleashing the Netherworld Tiger with her were dashed the moment Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock hit; Zhu Lu had no chance of resisting Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock with her Rank 29 cultivation.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s gaze turned to Xie Huanyue, who’d burst out of the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron’s trap. With a suggestive expression in his eyes, he asked, “Do you still want to continue?”</p>
 <p>Xie Huanyue looked at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, then swallowed his saliva with difficulty and laughed bitterly while shaking his head.</p>
 <p>How could they continue?</p>
 <p>Behind Huo Yuhao, Zhou Sichen had been watching fiercely, but hadn’t made his move. Both Dai Huabin and Wu Feng were three-ringed Soul Elders, yet they’d been taken down before they’d even had the opportunity to unleash a second attack towards Huo Yuhao. While Xie Huanyue thought highly of himself, he didn’t think that he was stronger than Dai Huabin.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao seemed to have become a new person after his disappearance; it was as if he’d transcended their age level. Xie Huanyue had thought that they’d be evenly matched, yet the match had ended in a flash.</p>
 <p>Teacher Mu Jin fell into a daze after watching the match. Huo Yuhao had not only displayed his abilities, but also his calmness and composure. Even as a teacher, she’d been petrified when she saw Huo Yuhao’s gaze in battle.</p>
 <p>It was a look filled with wisdom and farsightedness, seemingly as if everything on the battlefield was under his control. And indeed, the entire match had been entirely under his control. Class 2 hadn’t even had a chance. Class 1’s seven members had held an absolute advantage over the weaker members of Class 2 throughout the match; Dai Huabin hadn’t even managed to block a single attack from Huo Yuhao throughout the whole match.</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin’s soul power had reached Rank 39, and his White Tiger enhancemed his body. Yet, his White Tiger couldn’t overcome the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion no matter how strong it was.</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress’ Pincer was a pure strength-type soul skill that was supplemented by the elements. Now that Huo Yuhao’s body had been enhanced by the ten thousand year Whale Rubber, Life Gold, and other such treasures, he was no longer inferior in strength to Dai Huabin. More importantly, Wang Dong was backing Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s soul power had reached Rank 36, and wasn’t far off from Dai Huabin’s, while Huo Yuhao’s had reached Rank 30. The combination of their Haodong Power was overwhelmingly powerful. Even a Soul Elder wouldn’t have an easy time against Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress’ Pincer. However, Dai Huabin had regarded himself so highly that he thought his arm capable of resisting Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress’ Pincer. Basically, he’d sought death.</p>
 <p>The match had ended even faster than Huo Yuhao had expected. He looked at Wang Dong, then turned to Xiao Xiao, who put away her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron and Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute. The three of them felt that this match had been too simple; it had ended before they’d be able to unleash their full powers. Their opponents had even been the elites amongst those in their grade.</p>
 <p>The more that this happened, the more that they understood the benefits they’d obtained from participating in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, as well as the influence and change the closed-door cultivation had on them by letting them find their own paths.</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen, Cao Jinxuan, and the Lan sisters didn’t look excited now. Rather, they were stunned. The four of them looked at one another, then turned to face Huo Yuhao, more than just friendship in their eyes. A tinge of admiration was also present.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing had had a magical impact on how they’d been dispatched. They’d just had to unleash their soul skills and follow the rhythm and speed that Huo Yuhao set.</p>
 <p>Cao Jinxuan was awed more than the others, as he was a control-type soul master himself. This was true control! The key wasn’t just controlling one’s opponents; it was being able to control one’s teammates too. With such a godlike team leader, he was even more confident in fighting others above his level.</p>
 <p>The Lan sisters let go of their Hairnet after Huo Yuhao gestured for them to, releasing Huang Chutian, Cui Yajie, and Long Xiangyue.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi came beside Huo Yuhao and looked at the distant Mu Jin, who was in a daze. She wasn’t excited, but proud! How could she not be proud with such a disciple?</p>
 <p>“Teacher Mu, I hope that you and your students will take care of our class’s hygiene in the future. If your students can’t take it, don’t bother challenging my class to a match anymore.”</p>
 <p>Once she’d finished speaking, Teacher Zhou turned around, lifted her head and walked away proudly, whereas Teacher Mu turned pale.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao revealed a slight smile on his face.. He actually liked this part of Teacher Zhou; she’d guided him with this temperament and strictness of hers. He could sense the passion behind her strictness as well. Even though she was harsh on her students, she was also very protective of them. Those who truly knew her wouldn’t forget her.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just Zhou Yi who walked out of the Soul Dueling Area with her head held high. All of the students from Class 1 did the same. They all felt exalted!</p>
 <p>They hadn’t just won this match. They’d won it flawlessly! This exhilarating feeling made the students from Class 1 feel tempted to rush into the venue and battle alongside their classmates.</p>
 <p>In a dark corner of the stands, the director, Du Weilun, was in a daze as well.</p>
 <p>“Does he really only have two rings, dean? Why can’t I recognize Huo Yuhao anymore?”</p>
 <p>Yan Shaozhe revealed a smile on his face. “It’s not just you that got surprised, even the teachers were awed by his abilities. More importantly, this kid doesn’t just possess talent, but a desire to improve that’s even more outstanding. He’ll become a leading figure of the younger generation given another 3 to 5 years. I don’t think he used even half of his power when he teamed up with Wang Dong earlier.”</p>
 <p>Du Weilun was awed. “Fortunately, you fought for him. Otherwise, such a large talent would have been snagged by the Soul Tool Department…”</p>
 <p>Yan Shaozhe interrupted him with a sigh. “I owe the Soul Tool Department a favor because of this. From this year onwards, we shall let the Soul Tool Department choose from our third-grade students and above once they pass the advancement examinations. This is provided that said students are willing to go to the Soul Tool Department of course. We’ll grant them permission to leave as long as they’re willing.”</p>
 <p>Du Weilin was shocked. “Dean, we’ll lose many geniuses this way!”</p>
 <p>Yan Shaozhe sighed, then said, “Teacher was right: I’m not generous enough with my actions. I’ve also figured things out over time—that the Martial Soul and Soul Tool departments are a family. In addition, I have to admit that I agree that the world of soul masters will continue to change as soul tools continue to develop. Especially after hearing Wang Yan’s detailed analysis of the tournament. If we continue to remain stuck in our ways, we’ll be surpassed one day. It’s time to change things.”</p>
 <p>Du Weilun still seemed a little lost, thus Yan Shaozhe patted his shoulder and said, “Just follow my instructions. Go and find Wang Yan and see what he has to say. You’ll understand what I’m saying once you have.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan had remained cooped up in the inner courtyard after he’d led the team back from the tournament. The only thing he did was occupy the Library of the Sea God’s Pavilion like a thirsty sponge as he continued to absorb the knowledge that he’d yearned for in the past.</p>
 <p>As they were conversing, a weird voice suddenly resounded. “Little Xuan, come out!”</p>
 <p>This voice didn’t seem very loud, but it echoed through one’s ears. It was akin to a clap of thunder when it echoed through one’s head. More frighteningly, this voice had engulfed the entire Shrek Academy. These few words also seemed to cause the atmosphere to suddenly become more gloomy around the Academy..</p>
 <p>Yan Shaozhe’s expression immediately changed, and he said in a deep voice, “This isn’t good; there’s a powerful enemy coming. Weilun, instruct all students to remain in their classrooms. I’ll make the first move.” As he spoke, Yan Shaozhe’d body shook and shot forwards from where he was. He didn’t advance towards the direction where the voice came from, but rather straight towards Huo Yuhao, who was currently in the Soul Dueling Arena.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Huo Yuhao had only just left the area. However, he was also startled when he heard this voice, which caused his Spiritual Sea to shake. He said in shock, “What strong spiritual power. He’s here to find Elder Xuan? Who is this?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s expression also changed greatly, and a glimmer of golden light flashed slightly from the depths of his eyes.</p>
 <p>The rest of the students were far more horrified compared to the two of them. They turned pale, while those with lower cultivations had even begun to shake.</p>
 <p>“Yuhao, be careful. The owner of this voice is at the same level as that elder in the Sea God’s Pavilion.” The Skydream Iceworm’s voice was very stern. It wasn’t just him who’d felt this; the Ice Empress and Electrolux seemed to have awakened too. Huo Yuhao could even feel a slight tension in his Spiritual Sea.</p>
 <p>At this point, a gentle white light suddenly surrounded Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>“Don’t resist. I’m bringing the three of you to the Sea God’s Island.” Yan Shaozhe’s voice rang in their ears. The next moment, they felt as if they were flying among the clouds, and everything was white around them. Zhou Yi and the Class 1 students who were next to them only sensed a white light flash and they’d disappeared. Only Zhou Yi had been informed of the situation by Yan Shaozhe.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, don’t panic,” she said hurriedly, “follow me back to the classroom immediately!”</p>
 <p>Where was the safest place in Shrek Academy? The Sea God’s Pavilion.</p>
 <p>“Old freak Du, it’s you?” Elder Xuan’s sonorous voice resonated above Shrek Academy, and a streak of bright, yellow light shot into the sky. The blinding radiance instantly covered the entire academy in an instant. Furthermore, an immense aura came from within the academy, shooting into the sky like waves of billowing air.</p>
 <p>“What ‘honor’ of Shrek Academy? Are you going to bully us with your greater numbers? Let’s see about that.” Several intense lights and flames shot up towards the sky from outside Shrek Academy. There were more than 20 beams of light that didn’t fade from within the flames as they rocketed into the sky. They were led by a dark green beam of light that was large enough to almost completely cover the rest of the beams behind it.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan stood in the air above Sea God’s Island, took a sip of wine and said coldly, “What? Old freak Du, are you planning to wage war against Shrek Academy?”</p>
 <p>A figure slowly appeared from within the dark green beam of light.</p>
 <p>It was a huge old man, who’s dark green hair flowed freely behind his back. But the funny thing was that he didn’t have hair on top of his head—he was bald.</p>
 <p>This elder’s complexion was ruddy and smooth like a baby’s, and didn’t have many wrinkles either. The only way one could tell his age was through the look in his dark green eyes, which seemed as if they’d experienced the vicissitudes of life.</p>
 <p>The twenty-or-so beams of light behind the elder lined up, gradually revealing the figures within them. They took different shapes and sizes, but they were all undoubtedly top-ranked individuals in the world since they could float in mid-air through the power of their own cultivations.</p>
