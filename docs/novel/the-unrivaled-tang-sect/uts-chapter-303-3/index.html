They defeated the next four opponents they faced easily. With their immense abilities, they managed to make their way to the top of their group after winning six out of six matches. They had one foot in the quarterfinal.</span></p>

Shrek’s team! In the first five matches of this round-robin stage, they had snatched easy victories. Under Wang Qiu’er’s leadership, and with their extraordinary abilities, they managed to overcome the Clearjade Sect, too. It was also on that same day that the team and vice-team leaders, Cain and Xue Bing, were unfrozen.</span></p>

In this round-robin stage, the Sun Moon team had already lost to the Tang Sect. If they lost again, Shrek would advance with the Tang Sect into the quarterfinals. If they won, the Tang Sect and Shrek Academy would face off in the next match. The Tang Sect and the Sun Moon team would advance if the Tang Sect won. If the Tang Sect lost, all three teams would be tied on the number of wins, and points would be used to calculate which two teams would advance. While the Tang Sect had maintained a hundred percent record so far, their points weren’t very high because they kept on preparing themselves for the team fights. The point difference between Shrek’s team and the Sun Moon team was almost negligible, and the gap might be widened in this match.</span></p>

If they won, they could ensure their spot in the quarterfinals as long as they achieved a huge victory in the last match. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy wanted the Tang Sect and Shrek’s team to fight one another for the other spot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same situation for Shrek Academy. As long as they defeated the Sun Moon team, they would definitely qualify with six victories in the bag. Whether they were going to be the winner or runners-up of their group would depend on their last match with the Tang Sect.</span></p>

Shrek’s reputation was too well-established. The reputations of both academies meant that this faceoff between both teams was bound to be an extremely intense one!</span></p>

Do all of you know why the Tang Sect gave up against them in the earlier round, but fought them in the first match of the round-robin stage? Let me tell you! It’s because the Tang Sect was afraid that we would lose. They did their best to weaken the Sun Moon team and give us a greater chance.</span></p>

If not for the fact that Shrek’s Seven Monsters are representing the Tang Sect, we would only be substitutes! During the last tournament, I wasn’t even at Shrek Academy yet! But I heard of their performance. They were only substitutes then! What happened? They brought back the title. Let me ask all of you... do all of you have the heart of a champion?</span></p>

Our advancement will not arise because of anyone’s help, but our own abilities. Tomorrow, I’ll tear the skin off whoever dares to look down on us! Do all of you understand? We are not only going to show the Sun Moon team why we are strong; we are also going to show the Tang Sect that they can’t underestimate us! Let’s show them that we are champion material! We’ll win tomorrow’s fight! Shrek...will...win!”</span></p>

Her voice, which inspired their passion and excitement, raised their fighting spirits to unprecedented levels. So what if it was the Sun Moon Soul Engineering Academy? So what if it was the Tang Sect? They were representing Shrek Academy – a team that had never lost this tournament before! They were fighting for Shrek’s glory! Right now, they could finally chant this slogan in front of everyone!</span></p>

She said evenly, “Follow me.” After she finished speaking, she turned around and faced the stage. As she turned, her gaze met Huo Yuhao’s. As their gazes met, Huo Yuhao saw the look of perseverance in her eyes as she led Shrek’s team towards the stage.</span></p>

They only had four rings, and were only Soul Ancestors, they hadn’t made it into the inner courtyard yet. But Wang Qiu’er had chosen the two of them to compete in such an important match, and left out Wu Feng and Xie Huanyue, who were both in the inner courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was more shocked that Wu Feng didn’t pose any objections, even though she was such a proud character. He couldn’t see any dissatisfaction from her.</span></p>

He had to admit that Wang Qiu’er’s leadership skills were very strong, she was able to easily handle her bunch of tough and arrogant characters. He couldn’t claim that he was at her level.</span></p>

Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen looked very serious. To the two of them, this was also a life and death battle. Their clash against the Tang Sect had left them depleted, and they now had no choice but to use their substitutes. Even though Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen were very strong, the overall ability of the Sun Moon team had dropped.</span></p>

The entire place also went silent. Xu Tianran had already arrived on the main stage. He was very excited for today’s fight, too. Yesterday, he had personally gone to visit the Sun Moon team, and promised them heavy rewards if they won this match. If they could win this match, Xu Tianran promised them the title. In the quarterfinals, they wouldn’t have to face the Tang Sect. That was because the Tang Sect could only face them in the final, and the Tang Sect’s next opponents included the Holy Ghost Sect!</span></p>
