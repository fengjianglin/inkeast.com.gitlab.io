 <p><strong>Book 4: The Golden Road</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 25.1: Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda VS Spirit Eyes</strong></p>
 <p>If Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess was the pinnacle of beauty for Beast Souls, the Pagoda that had appeared within Ning Tian’s palm could be considered the pinnacle of elegance for Tool Souls.</p>
 <p>Ning Tian’s clear voice rang out the instant that the pagoda appeared.</p>
 <p>“I call upon the first of the Seven Treasures: Speed.” Her first soul ring lit up when she finished saying this, the rich yellow light causing the pagoda to become even more beautiful. Immediately afterwards, two dazzling rays of light shot out from the pagoda and landed on the bodies of Wu Feng and Nanmen Yun’er.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had activated his Spiritual Detection at the start of the match, but he discovered—to his astonishment—that he was unexpectedly unable to perceive the circulation of Ning Tian’s soul power, nor the soul skill that she was releasing. Ning Tian’s dazzling pagoda seemed to be emitting a mysterious soul power undulation, which was protecting her aura from leaking out. Furthermore, it was actually able to block Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</p>
 <p>Just what was this Tool Soul? It was actually this strong?</p>
 <p>The scene that followed caused Huo Yuhao’s team to become even more startled. Wang Dong’s and Xiao Xiao’s situation suddenly changed when the two rays of light landed on Wu Feng’s and Nanmen Yun’er’s bodies.</p>
 <p>The speed of Nanmen Yun’er’s palms suddenly increased as they swung towards Xiao Xiao, so much so that even a string of consecutive afterimages were formed in midair.</p>
 <p>If Huo Yuhao hadn’t had his Spiritual Detection active, Xiao Xiao might’ve suffered a great loss from this exchange. The instant that the ray of light had landed on Nanmen Yun’er, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection had warned her. At the same time, Huo Yuhao—who was currently standing behind her—had suddenly grabbed the back of her shirt and pulled her out of harm’s way. However, she’d only managed to dodge Nanmen Yun’er’s palms despite this.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Xiao Xiao had activated her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, causing it to descend from the sky with a flash of black light. Once it landed, it caused a violent bang to ring out; Xiao Xiao’s first soul ring lit up as her Cauldron Quake activated.</p>
 <p>From the start of the round-robin tournament till now, Nanmen Yun’er could be considered the fastest opponent they’d met. This was even more true since she’d received the boost from Ning Tian’s pagoda. Currently, her speed had completely exceeded the level of Soul Grandmasters; even agility system soul elders might not be able to best her in speed.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was even more important during direct combat situations such as this.</p>
 <p>After missing her attack, Nanmen Yun’er immediately charged forward. From her viewpoint, she was confident that she could end the battle within the shortest possible amount of time by utilising her complete dominance in speed.</p>
 <p>However, a sense of crisis appeared in her heart the instant she charged forward. She suddenly forced her body to a screeching stop, and her first soul ring lit up, causing her hands to shine with a green light. One could faintly see that it had also spread to her arms, causing a thin layer of green light to appear around them. It felt somewhat similar to Wang Dong’s Guillotine Wing, but was clearly much weaker.</p>
 <p>The instant that she, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron suddenly landed, separating her from Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>Nanmen Yun’er had originally planned to dodge it and continue attacking, but the effect of Xiao Xiao’s Cauldron Quake activated, stunning her.</p>
 <p>As a violent boom rang out, violent seismic waves covered Nanmen Yun’er’s body, immediately sending her into a daze for a brief moment.</p>
 <p>The combination of Xiao Xiao’s Cauldron Quake and Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection could definitely be considered a n extremely powerful weapon. Even with her swift speed, Nanmen Yun’er had suffered a loss.</p>
 <p>The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron then charged forward, slamming her body away.</p>
 <p>When the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron landed on the ground with a bang and stunned Nanmen Yun’er, the distant Ning Tian opened her mouth again. “I call upon the second of the Seven Treasures: Dispel.”</p>
 <p>Another ray of light landed on Nanmen Yun’er’s body after she finished speaking; even though her dazed state should’ve continued for a few more moments, it was forcefully dispelled. She immediately moved backwards as fast as she could, while dodging the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.</p>
 <p>As Huo Yuhao looked at the distant Ning Tian, he was inwardly astonished. <em>What a strong auxiliary system martial soul, and what formidable judgement!</em> She didn’t have his Spiritual Detection, yet she’d instantly been able to judge the changes in the condition of the battle, and had supported her teammates without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>From the soul skills she’d released so far, Huo Yuhao could tell that her first soul skill greatly increased the speed of her companions, while her second skill could dispel any negative effects or sealing abilities her teammates were afflicted with, thereby returning her teammates to their peak battle states. Regardless of whether it was battle experience or the strength of her martial soul, she completely deserved to be known as a Soul Elder-ranked expert!</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was astonished, but Nanmen Yun’er and Ning Tian were even more astonished than he was. Their astonishment naturally had nothing to do with Huo Yuhao. From their viewpoint, the powerful person was Xiao Xiao, who’d rapidly retreated and released her soul skill. Furthermore, the positioning and timing of the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron had simply been perfect. Furthermore, she’d perfectly controlled Nanmen Yun’er’s soul skill while simultaneously blocking her sure-kill attack, and had even narrowly counterattacked, forcing Ning Tian to use her second soul skill. The two girls couldn’t help but view Xiao Xiao in a new light.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the battlefield, Wang Dong and Wu Feng were still stuck in a fierce battle.</p>
 <p>Both parties had top-ranked Beast Souls, but Wu Feng had Ning Tian’s buff, causing her agility and attack speed to increase. At the same time, she’d released her first soul skill—Dragonfire.</p>
 <p>A dense layer of flames had shot out from her body, covering everything within 30cm of her. This made it so that all of her attacks possessed the high temperatures of Dragonfire, and made things extremely inconvenient for Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>However, Wang Dong’s combat strength wasn’t at all inferior to his opponent’s. His second soul ring was at the thousand year rank, so the increase in power provided by both his soul rings was greater than Wu Feng’s. The rarity of his Radiant Butterfly Goddess also surpassed that of her Red Dragon. Although his opponent’s speed was raised, don’t forget that he had the assistance of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection! Whenever he spread his Guillotine Wings wide, he wasn’t put at a disadvantage. Contrarily, he was even able to place himself in an advantageous position by relying on the predictive ability of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</p>
 <p>Ever since he’d fused his martial souls with Huo Yuhao’s, a sense of mutual understanding had faintly appeared between the two of them. The effectiveness of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection had become greater when used used on Wang Dong, compared to Xiao Xiao. Wang Dong’s Guillotine Wing would often slash straight at Wu Feng when even miniscule opening appeared in his head. Wu Feng—who was currently being attacked—felt as if her hands were tied. In her current state, she definitely felt that she was stronger than her opponent. However, she was unable to put herself in an advantageous position. She didn’t dare to let herself be hit by Wang Dong’s Guillotine Wing. On the other hand, Wang Dong’s Guillotine Wing seemed like a parasite; before she could even make a move, her opponent’s attacks would already be waiting for her. This insufferable feeling—one that made her want to vomit blood—caused her to let out a few screeches.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, her current speed exceeded Wang Dong’s, and she was able to change her movements much quicker. Although Wang Dong could predict her movements, he still had to focus on defense. Even if he could predict where and when his opponent would attack, he’d suffer a loss if he couldn’t keep up with his opponent’s speed.</p>
