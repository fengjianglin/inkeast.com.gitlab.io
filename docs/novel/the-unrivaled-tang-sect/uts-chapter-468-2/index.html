 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only one other possibility besides these two empires. The person who had just come to investigate came from one of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s reclusive sects. It was the only plausible explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi felt a headache come on when she thought about “reclusive sects”. As of now, they had conquered more than two-thirds of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s territory, but the Sun Moon Empire had also sustained heavy losses. Their greatest losses weren’t in the war. Instead, their greatest losses occurred when they were fighting those reclusive sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire had a long history, which could be traced back ten thousand years. Back then, the Heavenly Soul Empire was still called the Heaven Dou Empire, and the empire was formed by the Heavenly Soul Empire and the Dou Ling Empire. There were many soul masters in the Heavenly Soul Empire, and there were many reclusive sects as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though these reclusive sects didn’t want to have anything to do with the Heavenly Soul Empire in normal days, the Sun Moon Empire was their enemy in the end. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, and they had to work together against their common enemy. Reclusive sects were always very secretive with what they did, as they focused on protecting themselves. They were always doing hit-and-runs against the Sun Moon Empire, and it highly irritated her. Even though these people didn’t have a decisive impact on the war, they were consistently causing damage to the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had appeared in the Ming Dou Mountain Range before, and now they had appeared far into the Heavenly Soul Empire’s northeastern region. It seemed like this sect, who was adept at the art of concealment and reconnaissance, didn’t have just one person who was good at these things. What was more frightening was the ice-type domain attack that had a reach of a thousand meters in diameter. Based on that range, that person should be a powerful Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Titled Douluo were always terrifying as an enemy. A Titled Douluo was just one person, and his powerful strength, in addition to the fact that he was hiding in the darkness, meant that he was a threat whenever and wherever. Even if this person didn’t care about lashing out against normal soldiers, he was still a great threat to the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. Without talking about other things, this person would destroy every single one of their aerial surveillance soul tools if he attacked a few more times. He could blind her entire army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s hands gradually clenched into fists. Cold light flickered in her eyes; she had to find a way to remove this threat, no matter what!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already returned to Dragon City at this point. The soul-stirring thrill from before was just another unimpressive experience among all his past experiences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He returned to the cloth store. Nan Qiuqiu was still awake, and was waiting in the courtyard for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did you take so long?” She asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “The situation is more serious than I had imagined. The Sun Moon Empire’s Fire Phoenix Legion is hidden among the army of twenty thousand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was shocked. How could she not know about the Fire Phoenix Legion? “What are they trying to do?” she said nervously, “Do they want to destroy Dragon City?” If a legion with an overall fighting strength like that one wanted to cause destruction, destroying an entire city really wasn’t anything much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “How can that be? If that were the case, then they wouldn’t have to expend so much energy to penetrate Dragon City with soul tools and technology. However, I wasn’t able to discover their goal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu frowned and said, “Then what should we do? We should continue investigating and figure out what’s happening. There must be something they want, with such a powerful soul engineer legion around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at her with a strange look in his eyes. “Yes, investigating is the right way to go. But there’s no&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">we –&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">there’s only&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">me</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu’s eyebrows immediately went vertical. “What do you mean? You intend to abandon me and go alone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said sincerely, “Qiuqiu, did you notice the disturbance outside just now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was momentarily stunned, and said, “I didn’t hear any disturbance, but I did see faint flickers outside the city. That was you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded as he recounted his experience in detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I managed to escape, but by a hair’s breadth, with my own abilities. If you were with me, neither of us would have been able to escape.” Huo Yuhao said with a very pained look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was rude and unruly, but she definitely wasn’t unreasonable. She stared at him and said, “You can’t put it like that. Are you saying that I’m a burden?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said nothing, and just stared quietly at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was a little embarrassed and annoyed at his stare. She grunted furiously and said, “Fine, so I am a burden. I won’t follow you, then. But since they have already discovered you, their defenses will be much tighter. How are you going to find out what they want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I wanted to find intel directly, but since I can’t do that, then I can only follow them. Since they have come all the way to the northern regions, their destination can’t be far. I will definitely be able to find out what they want as long as I follow them. Don’t worry, I will be more careful with the lesson I’ve just learned.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu contemplated for a while. Even though she wasn’t convinced, she had no choice but to admit that she was a lot weaker than Huo Yuhao was. Huo Yuhao would be burdened if he had to take another person with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, alright. You go, then. I’ll wait in Dragon City for you, and we’ll head to our destination from before after you come back. But you must be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed and said, “Qiuqiu is a reasonable lady, indeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t do that. I’m going to sleep. Hurry and leave if you must.” Nan Qiuqiu turned around and went back to her own room after that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh in his mind as he watched her elegant profile.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiuqiu is a nice girl, and I can’t let her become like Qiu’er back then, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heart began to ache when he thought about Wang Qiu’er. Dong’er should still be alive no matter how her situation was, but Qiu’er was already… This feeling had become an agony deep in his heart that would last forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed as his thoughts stopped there, and returned to his own room. After this night’s hustle, the Sun Moon Empire wouldn’t move out throughout the night, so it wouldn’t be too late for him to follow them in the morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao snuck out after finishing breakfast the next day. Nan Qiuqiu didn’t escort him out, but sulked in her own room after he left instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Am I not just a little weaker than you? I’ll catch up to you!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu decided that she would go into closed-door cultivation during the days that Huo Yuhao wasn’t around, and began to work hard inside the cloth store.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao left the city through the eastern gate just like he had the previous day. He returned to the forest he was hiding in previously. He wasn’t hasty to go out this time. Instead, he began to meditate in the middle of the forest as he observed the movements of the Sun Moon Empire’s army in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t stupid. He had dealt such a heavy blow to the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion the previous day, so the defenses within their army camp had to be incredibly strict. He would be going to certain death if he took the risk to investigate at this time. Since that was the case, he chose to observe from afar, since his aim was to follow them anyway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The maximum range of his Spiritual Detection meant nothing could possibly go wrong if all he wanted to do was follow an army. Only if the Sun Moon Empire could redirect all their aerial surveillance soul tools to his location so that they could conduct surveillance close to the ground across all positions could they possibly discover his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t much disturbance within the Sun Moon Empire’s great army. Everything seemed very calm and peaceful one day later, as if nothing had happened last night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very patient. He wasn’t flustered at all as he cultivated quietly inside the forest. He would just wait it out. His enemies weren’t hasty, so why should he be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He simply used his spiritual power to detect in a single direction from time to time, and would sweep over the Sun Moon Empire’s camp to make sure that the Fire Phoenix Legion was still around before he continued cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had gained quite some inspiration from last night’s battle. Furthermore, he had been focusing his energy on studying Ultimate Ice over recent weeks. This was something that needed a lot of time for him to slowly grasp. At the same time, he needed time to absorb the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence in his body. Cultivating anywhere made no difference to him. As for being exposed outdoors, that was a piece of cake.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three days passed like that in the blink of an eye. The Sun Moon Empire finally couldn’t stand the loneliness anymore, and they made ready to depart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had to admit that this army was very outstanding. They didn’t create much of a disturbance as they moved out, and their formations were very neat and strict. The army on the periphery began to move first, and they took down their tents, while the soldiers responsible for impedimenta took everything apart and packed it up. The soldiers formed up in neat lines as they proceeded north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly located the Fire Phoenix Legion’s team. The legion’s members were walking on the ground, and their formation was very neat. They didn’t act all high and mighty just because they were soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They can’t hold back any longer?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile appeared at the corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth as he stood up. He wasn’t worried at all. He couldn’t follow too closely, as he would be easily discovered if he came too close. He just had to follow them from several kilometers out. With his Imitation, those aerial surveillance soul tools in the sky couldn’t possibly discover his presence as long as he maintained a sufficient distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao followed far behind once the army had completely uprooted and moved on. He didn’t follow behind them for long, proceeding on their flank as he gradually shifted forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that for him to complete his reconnaissance mission, or even to ruin the Sun Moon Empire’s mission, he had to allow his enemies to lower their guard first. Therefore, he couldn’t allow his enemies to discover his presence, no matter what. His enemies would believe that he was already gone, given enough time, and that he had never returned after escaping the other day. As for making a move, he wouldn’t do anything unless as a last resort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao followed at a distance just like that. The Sun Moon Empire’s army continued pushing forward as they went straight north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The army was moving very quickly. They were almost always jogging; they would jog for an hour before they walked for a bit, and then jog again. This army was moving at a spectacular speed, their overall quality obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The army traveled a hundred kilometers north in one day. The air was starting to become increasingly cold. They stopped to set up camp and cook food.</span></p>
