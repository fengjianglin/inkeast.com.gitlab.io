 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea was momentarily stunned as tears burst out from her eyes once more. This time, her tears became like golden pearls as the entire underwater world seemed to quiver from her sobbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, that’s not possible. The Sea God just said that you guys can save my child, so you definitely can. I’m begging you, please save my daughter. I’m willing to pay for my disrespect before this with my life.” The Princess was sobbing uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head and said, “Princess, it’s not that I’m unwilling to help you, but I really don’t have that ability. Perhaps, there might be something he could do if he were still awake. But he’s been knocked unconscious from the battle he just had with you, and he’s expended too much spiritual power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea finally understood that she had brought this upon herself! She glanced at her daughter on the ice jade bed and then at Huo Yuhao before she gritted her teeth and said, “If he’s consumed too much spiritual power, then I have a solution.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She raised her hand as she spoke and waved it in the water. The golden pearls that she had shed as tears gathered in front of her once more. The Princess hesitated no more, and the golden pearls glowed under her control and flew in Huo Yuhao’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mermaid’s tears were the most valuable pearls in the world, and they contained pure spiritual energy. If normal people could obtain even a single tear, their intelligence would be enhanced, and they would even find longevity from the nourishing of their spirit. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea was queen of the mermaids, and golden pearls like that only appeared when she was in extreme grief. Every single golden pearl was part of her spiritual origin, and they would naturally return to her body if they dissipated in the ocean’s water. But in this moment, she directly passed the energy in her tears to Huo Yuhao. In other words, she was fusing part of her spiritual origin with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faint golden light circled around Huo Yuhao as they gradually diffused into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual aura immediately grew dense, and the Snow Empress gave up control over his body as well. She allowed Huo Yuhao to absorb the Princess’ spiritual power in that air bubble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every golden pearl landed on Huo Yuhao’s forehead before disappearing inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny opened soundlessly after a few moments, and his translucent soul core deep inside his pupil spun rapidly as it absorbed the Princess’ vast spiritual origin from those golden pearls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core was initially as deep as it could be, and everything around it was like a black hole. However, after absorbing that spiritual power, the dark soul core was slowly tainted with a golden layer as its rotation slowed. However, its aura became increasingly stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivating soul cores was the most difficult task for soul masters. Why was it so hard to improve after becoming a Titled Douluo? The reason was because a Titled Douluo had to continuously consolidate his soul core if he wished to improve his cultivation, and he had to increase his soul core’s strength and stability. How difficult was that? Furthermore, this was a task that external forces couldn’t help with at all in typical circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao seemed to have been blessed from his misfortune. The Princess was a soul beast who could be considered one of the most adept with spiritual power in the world. Her spiritual power wasn’t overbearing and dominant like the Evileye Tyrant King, but was instead filled with warmth and gentleness like the ocean’s water, and these golden pearls were tears that came from her spiritual origin, so they contained her purest spiritual power. There weren’t any impurities in them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao didn’t run into any trouble throughout the fusion process, and the golden pearls greatly nourished his soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Changing a soul core’s fundamental qualities through cultivation was extremely difficult. What was happening to Huo Yuhao meant his spiritual soul core wasn’t at its original standard anymore, and it was going through a qualitative improvement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How hard was it to undergo a qualitative improvement like that at his level of spiritual power? This qualitative change would definitely be enormously helpful for him to form his second soul core. His control would be greatly improved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess stopped after forty-nine golden pearls fused with Huo Yuhao. Her face had become a little pale, and her spiritual aura was conspicuously weaker than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She would need tens of thousands of years of nourishment to recover after consuming so much of her spiritual origin. Of course, that wasn’t important to the Princess of the Sea. The most important matter for her was to save her child!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was nourished so much that he finally, gradually woke up from his deep slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first feeling he had when he opened his eyes was how clear this world was. He didn’t need Spiritual Detection for everything around him to be in his senses, and that feeling was just too magical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eh? Is this the underwater world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao regained his memory as he immediately snapped his head to one side. He heaved a huge sigh of relief when he saw a pair of large pinkish-blue eyes staring right at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt very warm and wonderful when he saw Tang Wutong’s concerned eyes as she stared at him. She was most concerned about him, no matter when and where!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m alright, don’t worry.” Tang Wutong held his hand and gently leaned against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s great!” Huo Yuhao reoriented himself before he turned towards the Princess of the Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess seemed very frail, but her eyes were filled with hope as she stared at Huo Yuhao and begged, “I’m sorry, my respected human friend. We have misunderstood you before this, and I am begging you to heal my daughter. If you can save her, the Merfolk are willing to do anything to return this favor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao didn’t know what had happened, he could tell from the Princess’ attitude that they should have reconciled their conflict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao then turned to the mermaid princess lying on the ice jade bed. Of course, he understood what the Princess of the Sea was saying. That was especially so because this mermaid princess’ aura had become extremely weak. It wouldn’t be long before she would leave this world forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, let me take a look at your daughter first.” He didn’t have time to ask about what had happened as he arrived next to the ice jade bed. The air bubble that was protecting him shifted and followed his footsteps very strangely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao activated Spiritual Detection, and it stretched like an enormous web over the mermaid princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao realized to his surprise that his spiritual power seemed to have undergone another qualitative enhancement. It had become like his Purple Demon Eyes, and possessed a kind of ability that could go into very intricate detail. Furthermore, his spiritual power had become a lot more consolidated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao inspected her closely for a while, and discovered what the mermaid princess’ problem was as he frowned tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The princess’ situation is not very optimistic. I’m afraid I don’t have the ability to heal her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea and her daughter’s faces changed drastically when they heard his words, and their eyes grew dim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were also very adept with spiritual power, and had already conducted all kinds of checks on their little princess. Naturally, they knew what the problem was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued, “The princess’ spirit must have been severely injured. There isn’t any problem with her body, but her spirit has been separated from her body. Furthermore, her spirit is fragmented and incomplete, while her origin has been heavily damaged. This is the reason why her spiritual sea and her life energy are dissipating so quickly. I’m afraid she can’t make it another day. If not for the fact that the princess’ spiritual power is sufficiently strong, she might have…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess forced back her grief and asked, “Is there really nothing you can do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao contemplated for a moment. “Princess of the Sea, can you tell me how she became like this? What kind of enemy hurt her? I need to know what kind of injury her spirit has suffered before I can think of a way to help her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea hurriedly nodded before she recounted the same story she had told the Snow empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately understood after listening to her description. “It seems like the princess must have been hurt by evil soul masters. That evil soul master wanted to turn her spirit into an avenging spirit, so he used special methods to strip her soul away. He filled her spirit with intense resentment and hatred during the extraction process, as only then can the princess’ soul maintain its tremendous strength after becoming an avenging spirit. But he hadn’t completed his extraction process when you rescued her, and that’s the cause of this current situation. Did you see what the princess was like when her soul was being stripped away? I need to know what happened, and how much of her spirit has been taken away, and which part. That’s the only way I can save her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea shook her head and said, “I don’t know all that. She was like that when I rescued her, and we couldn’t stay in that place for long, so we hurried back. We thought that we would definitely have a way to save her with our own abilities, but…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned and said, “Since that’s the case, I can only take a risk and try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess didn’t hesitate at all. “That’s alright, just do what you need to. The child is bound to die if you don’t try, and even if you fail, that’s just her bad luck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess’ trust made Huo Yuhao relax a little. He nodded and said, “I have to find out how her soul was being stripped away. I will use abilities similar to that of an evil soul master during the searching process, so please don’t misunderstand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I will protect you.” The Princess answered without any hesitation. She only had a single thread of hope left in her heart, and she would probably lose her child forever if she let this opportunity slip. She had already decided that this little daughter would eventually be her heir!</span></p>
