He leapt up suddenly and used his right hand to strike Tai Tan’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan chortled and allowed Huo Yuhao to strike him. He jerked his left arm and struck at Huo Yuhao. From the look of it, both parties were going to suffer in this collision. However, Huo Yuhao knew that he was the only one that was going to be hurt if he was hit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, an azure-green light shone extremely brightly at the instant Huo Yuhao drew closer, and an extreme chill spread out - the Domain of Perpetual Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Tai Tan’s cultivation was very high, he still shivered as he was subjected to Ultimate Ice soul skills inside the Domain. Sharp blades appeared from Huo Yuhao’s right hand - the Darkgolden Terrorclaws!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against Tai Tan, Huo Yuhao didn’t have to hold back, and used the complete version of the Darkgolden Terrorclaws immediately. He had been saving this attack for a long time. The huge claws reached out over ten meters, and the dark-golden light they emitted seemed like they wanted to cut heaven and earth apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan was shocked. As he panicked, he lifted his left arm to block.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful!” Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but exclaim. He only had one goal in challenging Tai Tan. He would be pleased as long as he could force Tai Tan’s martial soul out. However, the man didn’t unleash his martial soul even under such a situation. On the other hand, he used his body to block the Darkgolden Terrorclaws’ sure-kill technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao’s words soon stuck in his mouth. As the lights of the claw flashed by, they left five marks on the ground. The loud boom caused the mountain peak to shake slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And what about Tai Tan? He was standing there as if nothing had happened. There were only a few tears on his shirt…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kid, you’re going to have to pay me for this shirt!” Tai Tan laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that he was fine, Huo Yuhao immediately unleashed his next attack. Azure-green light engulfed his body, and a streak of icy blue light that used his backbone as a cross-section shot out. Tapping into the Domain of Perpetual Ice, this azure beam absorbed all the moisture in the air as it struck at Tai Tan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan staggered a little as he was stunned once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Ice Empress’ Wrath didn’t cause any harm to him. It didn’t even manage to restrict him. Tai Tan was still fine as he stood where he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was getting a little dejected. He was using all the methods at his disposal. He didn’t use Spiritual Shock because he knew that he was only going to trouble himself if he used it, given the huge gap in their spiritual powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless he used soul tools, he didn’t have any stronger capabilities to continue fighting. At this point, he realized that his skills were useless in front of a truly strong individual. It wasn’t that they were lousy; it was that his cultivation was still lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it wasn’t all bad news. In this series of attacks, Huo Yuhao could sense the changes in this cultivation after he gained his fifth soul ring. The depletion of his soul power when using soul skills had dropped significantly. Even after using all his previous attacks, he had only expended about twenty percent of his soul power, even though every skill he used was rather strong. He had even used the Eye of Destiny! In the past, that alone would have used up half of his soul power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, nothing seemed to affect Tai Tan at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that all you got, kid? There’s nothing else?” Tai Tan brushed the icing off his body and looked at his torn sleeves before nodding to himself. After the series of attacks, he had a deeper understanding of Huo Yuhao’s cultivation. The soul skills that he used at the end weren’t too impressive to him, and Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice couldn’t threaten him. He had been shocked the most by Huo Yuhao’s first fist. The fist had combined his spiritual power, aura, and soul power together, leaving a deep impression on Tai Tan. From that fist alone, Tai Tan could confirm that Wang Dong wasn’t Huo Yuhao’s match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “I’m too lousy compared to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!” At this point, the Snow Lady’s voice rose. She drifted over in front of Huo Yuhao, unconvinced as she pointed her finger at herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed, “Are you saying there’s still you? Where did you go just now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady made another small action that made Tai Tan cringe. She lowered her head and pointed her two index fingers to the front, wearing an indignant look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rushed to comfort her, “Don’t worry. We are too far behind Uncle Tai. It’s normal that we’re losing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!” yhe Snow Lady shouted again. Even Tai Tan could tell that she wasn’t pleased from her voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is she saying?” Tai Tan asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao translated, “She asked me to try again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan chortled and said, “Come on, try again! Oh yes, I was too bothered with assessing your abilities, and forgot to whack you to vent my anger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help, but laugh. While Tai Tan’s temper seemed very short, he was in fact quite cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao glanced at the Snow Lady and said, “I shall depend on you, then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!” The Snow Lady lifted her chest, and her white robe shook slightly. If one didn’t know that she was a Spirit, he might think that her arms and legs were getting cold from being exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao squinted his eyes and quickly connected his mind with hers. He was sensing her opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A stunned look flashed across his eyes. In the next moment, the Snow Lady had already lifted her right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She looked very amusing as she lifted her right arm, especially when she extended her little fingers to point into the sky. Her deep blue eyes appeared very serious, but there was only one word to describe her – too cute!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan felt that he had great affinity with her. No matter how he looked at her, he absolutely adored her. Furthermore, he liked her the more she pranked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!” the Snow Lady shouted, and a magical scene occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Azure-green light expanded from Huo Yuhao’s body. It was the Domain of Perpetual Ice. At the same time, an intense orange-gold light shot out from the Snow Lady’s body. The second out of the four orange-gold soul rings on Huo Yuhao’s body started to shine very brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The temperature in the air dropped significantly, and it seemed to have fallen below negative twenty degrees Celsius. Furthermore, this new temperature covered all of Clear Sky Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountaintop became a world of ice and snow. Heavy snow raged under the effect of the strong winds. The three of them even lost track of where the others were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Tai Tan and Niu Tian needed to circulate their soul power to resist the cold under such conditions. Tai Tan was shocked to find out that he couldn’t pinpoint Huo Yuhao’s position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this level, one didn’t need his eyes to know his opponent’s position. He could feel it. However, he couldn’t sense anything in this brutal snowstorm. It was as if his senses were sealed.</span></p>

However, the effects of the soul skills were additional. The Snow Lady’s help enabled Huo Yuhao’s abilities to multiply all by herself.</span></p>

However, he couldn’t cover as large an area as she did now, or reduce the temperature so drastically. After he completed this Domain with the Snow Lady, he was shocked to find out that the depletion of his soul power was much less than he had expected.</span></p>

They were continuously converted into chilly wind and sharp snowflakes under the effects of this powerful Domain.</span></p>

Combined with his Domain of Perpetual Ice, it was called the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>

According to the current strength of the Domain, he could hold it for about ten minutes. The domain also covered a region more than five hundred meters in diameter. This was a true Domain-type soul skill! Huo Yuhao was already pleased with the help of one soul skill, but in this Domain, his abilities increased significantly!</span></p>
