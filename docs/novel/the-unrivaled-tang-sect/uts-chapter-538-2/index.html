 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5e07d8ec-7fff-b3e8-ae77-d7c6c1835c40"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, when he duelled with Wang Qiu’er, it was already very difficult for him to defeat her. Currently, Tang Wutong’s current ability seemed to be a combination of Wang Qiu’er’s and Wang Dong’er’s abilities. She was also already a Titled Douluo. When it came to individual abilities, she was probably the strongest in the whole Tang Sect. Even though Huo Yuhao was boosted by his multiple spirits, he could not be complacent when going up against her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing how he had been excluded from this upcoming affair, Ji Juechen retreated to the side unwillingly. However, he was still very excited to watch a battle between two powerful cultivators. Watching their battle was still very useful for his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ji Juechen retreated, Huo Yuhao took up his place as he allowed his energy to calm down. As he watched Tang Wutong, who was walking further and further away, he started to focus on his target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, He Caitou, and the others stopped fooling around. Xiao Xiao had quietly returned as she took up a place beside He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, everyone knew well enough that the two strongest cultivators in Tang Sect were none other than Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. However, they were not certain exactly how strong these two were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao teamed up with Tang Wutong to pin down the two evil soul masters, they had fully demonstrated the power of their martial soul fusion skills. However, that was still fundamentally different from facing off against one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One-on-one battles were the true demonstration of an individual’s abilities. It would show everyone how strong they had become, and that was something that everyone from Tang Sect wanted to know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu, who was standing to one side moved over to talk to Tang Wutong. She waved her fist and cheered, “Wutong, go for it! Beat him! Beat him until he loses all his teeth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was at a loss for words. “Qiuqiu, do you really hate me that much?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu replied, “This is no longer an issue of hatred. It’s about the battle between the sexes. Ladies, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her words received support from her fellow ladies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi then cheered loudly, “Yuhao, you can do it. Brother Ji has already lost the first round. You must not lose again! If you lose, I am afraid every male in Tang Sect will have to walk around with our heads lowered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s easy for you to say. I don’t think it will be an easy fight against Wutong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Tang Wutong had already walked to a distance which would separate her from Huo Yuhao by about a hundred meters. When she turned around to face Huo Yuhao, her beautiful eyes showed the excitement in her heart. No one knew whether she was excited to fight, or excited by the prospect of destroying Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao focused his gaze on Tang Wutong. Bei Bei walked forward a few steps before declaring, “I will be the referee for this duel. Are both of you ready?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the previous duel between Ji Juechen and Xiao Xiao, this duel was obviously a lot more formal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As of now, the higher-ups of Tang Sect were not the only spectators. After hearing the commotion above the knoll, many of the soul engineers from the three legions had left their resting areas and surrounded the knoll to watch the upcoming duel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that they were about to witness a duel between Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, all of them were visibly more excited than the duelists themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the soul engineers in the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, the Fort Soul Engineer Legion, and the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion were young people. Even the older ones were only middle-aged. They were all people who were full of bloodlust, and were raring to watch people fight. They were extremely interested to watch a battle between two top-class soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, quite a number of people within the legions had witnessed Huo Yuhao demonstrate his abilities during the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date. It was also then that he got together with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even people who were not fortunate enough to see them at the Blind Date would have definitely heard about them. Now, they were about to watch them duel in front of their eyes. It was an opportunity not to be missed! As people quickly passed the message about the duel that was about to start, a large number of soul engineers had surrounded the sparring ground. Even though they were keeping a safe distance from the actual ground itself, their excitement was still infectious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were not anxious about the duel at all. Both of them merely stood there as they waited patiently for the duel to officially begin. Even though the fight was about to start, both of them were perfectly fine with having the legions spectate their battle, because it was a good way to improve their morale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone wanted to be assured of the strength of their commanders. A strong commander would not only lead them to victory, but would also be capable of keeping them safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong chose to wait a little longer until everyone had found a safe viewing point before they nodded at Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei naturally understood their intentions as he smiled. “Both of you really have great chemistry! Are you ready?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, they nodded. Bei Bei raised his right hand before looking at both of them. Then, he lowered his hand rapidly as he announced, “Start!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he announced the start of the duel, Tang Wutong made the first move. Her beautiful dragon wings opened up from her back as her soul rings ascended from her feet. The sight of this made the throngs of soul engineers cheer in delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not only cheering because she had nine soul rings. &nbsp;She possessed a combination of soul rings which far exceeded the best-known combination! The sight of Tang Wutong’s red hundred-thousand-year soul ring made the crowd wild.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this the true strength of the wife of our Chief Commander? That’s unbelievable! Will Chief Commander be able to beat her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After witnessing the powerful soul rings Tang Wutong possessed, everyone turned their attention to Huo Yuhao. Once again, they were stunned by what they saw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes released a gentle golden glow as a humongous golden eye formed behind his back. Seven soul rings gently ascended from his feet. Even though there were only seven rings, their colors were overwhelmingly attention-grabbing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first soul ring was milky-white, with a circle of golden carvings. The second soul ring was already black. The third, fourth and fifth soul rings were also black in color. And to everyone’s surprise, the sixth and seventh soul rings were red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the appearance of his seventh soul ring, the air around Huo Yuhao started to bend and twist, as though he were no longer real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong slowly raised her right hand as her body emanated an intense golden glow, which spread outwards in the shape of a butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she tapped the tip of her foot on the ground gently, she sprang forwards towards Huo Yuhao in flight. As her wings flapped intensely behind her back, she had already flown a hundred meters and was right in front of Huo Yuhao before anyone could even see how she did it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s way too fast!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone cheered in unison after witnessing her incredible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong leaned slightly to the side as her right wing went straight for Huo Yuhao. A deafening howl could be heard as the dragon wing extended to form a gigantic blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body had become illusory the moment Tang Wutong dashed over. He had activated his Spiritual Interference Domain. While the wing cut through his figure, it was not able to hit his real body. Huo Yuhao had silently moved towards behind Tang Wutong right before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He threw out a simple punch at her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the punch seemed extraordinarily simple, Tang Wutong froze after receiving the blow, as though she had become immobile. Huo Yuhao’s punch seemed to contain a black hole that was holding her in place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong closed and folded the wings behind her back before releasing them again violently as she hoped to use the sharp edges of her wings to counter Huo Yuhao’s fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this instant, Huo Yuhao's eyes flashed as he released a spiritual blast radiating from the center of his body into the area about ten meters from him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden trident rune on Tang Wutong's forehead flickered and absorbed most of the force from the spiritual blast. This only delayed Wutong slightly, as her wings continued in their course and collided with Huo Yuhao's fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Ping!" A loud metallic sound rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retreated rapidly upon their collision. The others also noticed how the air around him had started to show signs of cracking and shattering. These cracks were caused by the sharpness of Tang Wutong's dragon wings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, things were also not easy for Tang Wutong. The golden light from Huo Yuhao's fist had followed the contours of her wings and flowed into her body. To her surprise, this golden glow caused her to lose her focus for a split second.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being forced backwards, Huo Yuhao's third soul ring lit up. A vertical beam of white light shone on Tang Wutong. Mass Enfeeblement! Of course, it had been focused on a single target under Huo Yuhao's superior control. Its power was naturally magnified as it became a lot more concentrated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, his fourth soul ring lit up. A mysterious whirlpool formed above Tang Wutong's head. If one were to pay attention to the whirlpool, one would notice the little vertical eye which was flickering within it. Spiritual Confusion!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After releasing two powerful control-type soul skills simultaneously, Huo Yuhao's soul rings suddenly changed. The original seven rings became eight different soul rings. Even their colors had become different. As he raised his right hand, a gigantic deep blue sword appeared. Following which, the sword went for Tang Wutong's head as it followed the two powerful soul skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques: Unparalleled Chill, Empress’ Sword!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This series of transformations was extremely rapid. Everyone found it hard to follow Huo Yuhao's movements, as his attacks were just too quick for their eyes. His transition from controlling to attacking was seamless. He did not seem like he was going easy on Tang Wutong at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong only lost her focus momentarily. When the Mass Enfeeblement landed on her body, she had already regained her focus. Her eyes revealed a flash as her body flipped on its own in mid-air. Afterwards, she raised her hands as her fourth soul ring lit up. Dragon God's Possession!</span></p>
