 <p><strong>Book 6: Graduating</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 36.1: The Awakened Gray Color!</strong></p>
 <p>Surprisingly, Huo Yuhao had actually stood up! Furthermore, he’d used a hoarse yet determined voice to express his wish to continue fighting.</p>
 <p>The students who’d originally thought the battle to be over immediately quieted back down and stared at Huo Yuhao with stupefied gazes. They were unable to fathom what could be helping him stand back up since he’d been struck by Wu Feng’s powerful attack. Was the position of class monitor <em>this</em> important to Huo Yuhao?</p>
 <p>To Huo Yuhao, whether or not he became a class monitor didn’t really matter. However, his honor was something extremely important to him; he couldn’t allow anyone to tarnish it. This was the reason he’d accepted Wu Feng’s challenge in the first place—even though he knew he’d probably lose. It was also the same reason he was standing back up now.</p>
 <p>Wu Feng’s hysteria immediately diminished the second that she saw the red glow in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. However, the instant that Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned gray, she felt as if an enormous hand had grasped hold of her neck and was strangling her.</p>
 <p>This was the first time that Wu Feng had felt dread from Huo Yuhao. Regardless of how strong she actually was, she was still a young girl no older than twelve!</p>
 <p>Wang Yan was also dumbfounded by Huo Yuhao’s current appearance. He hurriedly took a few steps back, while his heartbeat began to accelerate uncontrollably. The only explanation he could come up with for Huo Yuhao’s sudden change was a reason related to Body Souls. Thus, instead of interrupting their Soul Duel, he fixated his eyes on Huo Yuhao’s body whilst doing his best to sense the changes occurring within it.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had truly transformed in some way. As his had eyes turned bloodshot, his heart filled with an unyielding will to fight and resentment surging throughout his body, a refreshing feeling had suddenly spread silently throughout his Spiritual Sea. This refreshing feeling instantly covered the entirety of his Spiritual Sea, causing even the Skydream Iceworm to let out a bewildered cry.</p>
 <p>Gray—Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sea instantly turned gray. However, the dormant gray pearl that had always silently resided in his Spiritual Sea had vanished.</p>
 <p>The refreshing feeling quietly calmed down Huo Yuhao’s surging resentment and allowed Huo Yuhao to quickly regain his senses. However, his eyes had turned gray due to the changes in his Spiritual Sea.</p>
 <p>“Hatred will cloud your eyes.” A wise yet clear voice rang out in Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sea. When it did, even the Skydream Iceworm was able to clearly hear it.</p>
 <p>Ten balls of golden light simultaneously lit up in an attempt to expel the gray stream of light that had appeared, but it didn’t react at all. It was as if it was incorporeal. No matter how strong the Skydream Iceworm’s origin power was, it didn’t seem to affect the gray light; it hadn’t even been scratched.</p>
 <p>“You should use your spiritual power like this.” Huo Yuhao discovered that he’d lost all control of his body, but he could still clearly see everything that happened. Immediately afterwards, he felt his soul power boil. The Mysterious Heaven Technique’s soul power—identical to his in terms of power, quantity, and intensity—had also had its control wrested from him.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, his gray Spirit Eyes lit up as his Spiritual Shock was activated again. To his astonishment, this Spiritual Shock moved slower than normal as it left his eyes—as if it was a viper slowly extending its tongue.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the original ball-like Spiritual Shock had been shrunken down to the width of a strand of hair as it gently flew towards Wu Feng.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of the spectating students, Huo Yuhao’s eyes had suddenly lit up and turned crystal clear, rather than the muddy gray they’d been before. The gray light in his eyes had flickered slightly, after which Wu Feng had let out a sharp cry.</p>
 <p>Wu Feng had gathered her soul power around her brain the second the feeling of dread had appeared in her heart. However, at this moment, she suddenly sensed a gray needle slowly arrive in front of her. It pierced through the layer of soul power she’d created, then gently tapped her brain.</p>
 <p>Wu Feng’s flowing red hair flew into the air as her eyes turned gray as well. Immediately afterwards, she fell backwards with a sharp cry and directly lost consciousness.</p>
 <p>The battle had ended, but the students of Class 1 had fallen completely silent, as if their necks had been strangled just like Wu Feng’s earlier.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s body shook slightly, and the hint of gray in his eyes slowly faded away. However, he continued to stand as straight as a ramrod. After sweeping his already-normal eyes across the spectating students, he slowly left the arena without sparing a glance towards Wu Feng.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan hurriedly walked towards Wu Feng and made sure that she hadn’t suffered any true injuries. However, he still decided to carry her to the infirmary.</p>
 <p>Whilst running towards the infirmary, Wang Yan felt a passionate fire ignite in his heart. <em>Right, that was definitely the second awakening of a Body Soul. It must’ve been! Otherwise, why would his eyes suddenly change color? Why else would he be able to beat Wu Feng? Huo Yuhao won, he won! This won’t do, I have to find Elder Xuan and have him select Huo Yuhao as a core disciple.</em></p>
 <p>As Huo Yuhao was quickly approaching the resting room, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao had just left the arena, allowing them to bump into the grave-faced Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>“Yuhao, you’re awesome!” Xiao Xiao excitedly cried out. However, Wang Dong walked towards Huo Yuhao after realizing that something was off.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao looked deeply at Wang Dong. Afterwards, he directly collapsed onto Wang Dong’s body, passed out. Moreover, his breath was scorching hot.</p>
 <p>In reality, Huo Yuhao’s injuries were even more serious than Wu Feng’s. Wu Feng’s dual-soul skill augmented attack had seriously injured him. However, he’d forced himself to stand upright in front of all the other students. With deep breaths as he persevered, he’d carried himself all the way to the resting room.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong secured him tightly to his back with Xiao Xiao’s help, then rushed outside with only one thought on his mind, <em>Yuhao didn’t want anyone else to see him like this, so I have to fulfill his wish. He ran towards the dorms with quick strides.</em></p>
 <p>Only after Wang Dong had left did Xiao Xiao react. She hurriedly chased after Wang Dong, stopping only after they’d reached the dormitory area.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s physical body had fainted, but his consciousness had been dragged back into his Spiritual Sea. Moreover, he was exceptionally clear-headed.</p>
 <p>“Old fella, just who are you? Why do you want to fight over territory with me?” The Skydream Iceworm grumbled.</p>
 <p>The gray light didn’t withdraw, nor did it encroach upon the Skydream Iceworm.</p>
 <p>“This old man, fight with you over territory? Who do you think you are? You’re just a fleshy worm. If it weren’t for the fact that I currently only have a trace of my divine sense left, I’d turn you into fertiliser in mere moments.” The aged voice wasn’t willing to submit.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm spat, “Bullshit. If you think you’re strong enough, come on! Let’s see who’ll get rid of who! Don’t think that this Brother can’t see that you only have a strand of divine sense left. You don’t even have any power left! Do you really think that you can beat me in a fight by yourself?”</p>
 <p>The aged voice replied disdainfully, “You’re right; this old man only has a strand of divine sense left. However, this old man’s divine sense is on a much, much higher level than yours. Can you even do anything to me? Even though my divine sense has been shattered, you can’t even take on this single strand of it. Think about it: If I were to gradually recover strength and memories, what would happen then? I’d crush your fleshy body, then slowly squeeze you until all of your juice had squirted out."</p>
 <p>“You…” The Skydream Iceworm evidently couldn’t beat the old man in a war of words. He was infuriated to the point that all ten golden balls of light had unceasingly begun to surge with light.</p>
 <p>“This, what happened?” Huo Yuhao was flabbergasted. Why had his Spiritual Sea become so lively in this short period of time?</p>
 <p>The aged voice spoke to him in a much warmer tone, “Little fella, this old man didn’t belong to your world in the beginning. I only remember that, when I was about to die, I broke through the barriers of space and entered your world with only a strand of my divine sense remaining. I don’t know why that happened, but it might’ve been because of my overly strong soul power. When that large worm fused with you, it created intense undulations of energy that guided me towards you. Thus, my strand of divine sense entered your Spiritual Sea. Don’t worry, I don’t harbour any evil intentions. However, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to leave you, even in the future.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve only been left with this single strand of divine sense, so I’m extremely weak. I need time to slowly recover all of my memories, but the resentment that appeared in your heart earlier gave me a familiar feeling that finally woke me up. I don’t remember what happened in my past, but I can definitely tell you that you shouldn’t let hatred cloud your eyes. Once you do something unredeemable, you’ll regret it till the day you die. Furthermore, you won’t be able to do anything to make up for it. Something similar seems to have happened to me in the past. Fortunately, you’re still young, and you’re not too strong yet. There’s still time for you to gradually dispel the hatred in your heart.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s voice changed. “You’re saying that I shouldn’t get my revenge?”</p>
 <p>The aged voice replied indifferently, “That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying that you shouldn’t take out your anger on people who don’t deserve it. You can still get your revenge, but don’t harm the innocent. For example, let’s say that the chief of a village harms you. Would you slaughter the entire village if you were strong enough? Did those innocent villagers commit any sin?”</p>
 <p>Unhappy, the Skydream Iceworm cried out angrily, “Oi, Yuhao’s my host. He doesn’t need you to teach him anything! Do you think that this Brother is just air?”</p>
 <p>The aged voice replied in an extremely disdainful tone, “You’re naturally not air, you’re just a little bug. This old man’s too lazy to bother with you, I’m going to continue restoring my divine sense.” After saying this, his attention shifted back towards Huo Yuhao. “I scanned through your memories. You have too much hate built up in you. You can do as you wish and vent your hatred, but you can’t let this hatred ferment. Once I’ve recovered enough of my divine sense, I’ll do my best to help you out. Let me see what I can remember... Oh… other than a few blurry bits and pieces, it seems that I can only remember a single phrase: My hand grasps the sun and moon and plucks the stars from the sky; this world has no one else like me. Haha, hahahaha.”</p>
