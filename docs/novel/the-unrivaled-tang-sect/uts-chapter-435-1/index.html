However, a dash of coldness flashed deep inside his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Beast God, Di Tian!</span></p>

Huo Yuhao gradually drifted into view there, and he swiftly calmed down the raging tides that his four powerful Spirits had started. All four of them trained their eyes on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be worried.” Huo Yuhao’s calm voice travelled throughout his entire spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao!” The Skydream Iceworm was panting, and his breathing was thick and heavy.</span></p>

Since I have triggered this for the first time, there will be a second time, and there will be a third time. Do you guys trust me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All four Spirits were starting at him. The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was the first to transform into a beam of flowing light and land on his body. It didn’t have that many expectations and hopes when it chose Huo Yuhao, therefore, it also experienced the least disappointment. Faced with Huo Yuhao’s calm and formless pressure, it instantly made its choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress, the Snow Empress, and the Skydream Iceworm were all looking at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

Furthermore, even Di Tian can only obstruct me, but he cannot obstruct the heavens. Not even the Beast God can stop the heavens! Therefore, he was one step behind me today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All three soul beasts trembled at the same time when they heard his words, and their eyes flowed with incredulous looks.</span></p>

His spiritual sea riled up once more with him as the epicenter, but his spiritual sea was rippling with a rhythm this time. His immense spiritual power circulated rapidly around his body as a whirlpool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is to defeat Di Tian!”</span></p>

These four words were simple, but who dared to say something like this in the world today? Who even dared to think such a thing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian was the strongest individual in the world, after the Gods. He was the Douluo Continent’s number one Savage Beast, and he was possibly the strongest individual across the entire Douluo Continent. He was a Golden-Eyed Black Dragon King with eight hundred thousand years of cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had almost obliterated Shrek City all by himself. With his strength, how many people dared to challenge him, and how many people dared to claim they could defeat him?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when Huo Yuhao uttered those four words seriously, all three powerful soul beasts felt as if those four words were real. Huo Yuhao’s tone didn’t contain any outrageousness or arrogance; there was only seriousness, perseverance, and persistence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Defeating Di Tian was Huo Yuhao’s target for the future!</span></p>

A human who wanted to defeat the Beast God one on one… that was simply a joke. Even the strongest human that people knew about in the world today, the Dragon God Douluo Long Xiaoyao, wouldn’t say something like that. The stronger one became, the more one knew about how difficult it was to become stronger after a certain level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Beast God was someone who had gone through eight hundred thousand years of cultivation to reach his strength today. Only an Ultimate Douluo and other individuals of that strength could guess exactly how deep Di Tian’s foundations were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao made this claim, and he definitely wasn’t joking about it. He was very serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten years ago, he was a child inside the Duke’s Mansion who didn’t have proper meals to satiate his hunger. However, now, he wasn’t even twenty years of age, and he had already become a Soul Sage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Soul Sage with twin martial souls!</span></p>

He had invented Spirits, and founded the Spirit Pagoda. He had become something like a imperishable monolith in the history of soul masters, and his name was spread across the entire Continent with the Spirit Pagoda’s establishment. Every soul master knew his name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He possessed powerful spiritual power, and even with his seven soul rings, his spiritual power was stronger than that of a Titled Douluo. Furthermore, he also possessed Ultimate Ice, a truly formidable existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao seemed exceptionally gifted in every aspect and characteristic. However, only the Ice Empress and the Skydream Iceworm, who had always been by his side, knew how much Huo Yuhao had given, and how much effort he had put in throughout the entire process. Only they knew how much determination and resolve he had to have to achieve everything that he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had displayed resilience unmatched by normal people ever since he began fusing with the Skydream Iceworm. After joining Shrek Academy, he cultivated hard with inferior talent and innate abilities compared to everyone else. Huo Yuhao had gone through so many ordeals and trials during every step of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had had to watch the woman that he loved the most enter a deep slumber with his own eyes, and he had to watch another girl that loved him dearly offer her life for him. Every leap forward that Huo Yuhao’s strength took was accompanied by uncountable pains and toils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he had taken everything in his stride on his journey.</span></p>

He wasn’t that small blade of grass that swayed in the rain and the wind, he had grown into a robust and large, sturdy tree. Even though he was only a Soul Sage, nobody dared to claim that he wasn’t someone who played a decisive role, and one who held a balance of power on the Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the youngest member of the Sea God’s Pavilion, and a human that the Great Star Dou Forest had sworn to protect. Even the Beast God, Di Tian, had had no choice but to monitor him, though he didn’t dare let him communicate with powerful individuals from another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he uttered those words, that he wanted to defeat Di Tian, the first thought that appeared in the three soul beasts’ minds was,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He will definitely work as hard as he can to reach this goal.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything seemed impossible, but was it really impossible? How many things had Huo Yuhao done that were impossible for normal human beings? Huo Yuhao himself was like a monster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m sorry, Yuhao.” The Skydream Iceworm lowered his head, and two rows of tears flowed down his cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t release his tightly clenched fists, but his voice became a lot plainer than before. “There’s nothing to be sorry for, brother Skydream. I can understand what you’re feeling inside. I hate what’s happened to me, too, but hatred can’t achieve anything. All I can do is become stronger continuously, and one day, when I have enough strength to defeat the Beast God, I will make the reverse scale that he has attached to my body disappear. That day will be the day that I will take you guys into eternity. This is the goal that I have chased and desired my entire life. Furthermore, I trust that this goal is definitely not too far away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress’ icy voice rang out. “We will always accompany you as long as you still have that fighting spirit. Good luck!” After she finished her sentence, her wise and ice-cold eyes became crystal clear once again, and the little Snow Lady returned. She transformed into a beam of white light and disappeared into Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>

As long as you have the will to fight, we will always be your strongest and most determined supporting strengths. Good luck, Yuhao!”</span></p>

They vanished into his body inside his spiritual sea.</span></p>

He raised his fists and silently gazed into the distance.</span></p>

What happened?” Bei Bei asked in concern from beside Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had told him that he was alright before he descended into deep contemplation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was alright… but how could he be alright? That power of darkness didn’t belong to Huo Yuhao! That power of darkness suddenly appeared in a place like this, a place filled with light energy. That was highly unnatural in the first place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s body trembled as if he had awoken. He glanced at his companions, who were watching him with concerned expressions, and smiled as he shook his head. “I’m alright. That came from some power that the Beast God Di Tian has infused into my body. That power is meant to protect me. It might have sensed that my aura was starting to change, so it appeared to protect me. I’m okay now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you sure?” Bei Bei asked a little doubtfully. “Why do I feel that that aura didn’t come out to protect you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and smiled. “Eldest senior brother... you, third senior brother, and fourth senior sister have successfully fused with your respective Spirits. Congratulations! This time, your strengths have been greatly boosted. We should be going, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei could tell that Huo Yuhao wasn’t willing to tell him. He gave Huo Yuhao a serious look before he tilted his head slightly and said, “Alright, let’s go then. Little junior brother, if you have any problems, you have to tell me in time. Even if the Tang Sect can’t resolve these problems for you, we can still find Elder Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao heaved a faint sigh inside. Not even Elder Xuan could resolve the problems in his body!</span></p>

Bi Ji was still waiting outside, and she inquired about the process when she saw them walk out. She felt relieved when she heard that Xu Sanshi’s spirit transmission was smooth and successful, and she personally escorted them out. The Spirit Transmitting Hall was still being constructed, and it wasn’t appropriate to receive any visitors, so Bi Ji didn’t ask them to stay behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei stared at Huo Yuhao as they stood at the entrance to the Spirit Transmitting Hall. “Yuhao, you guys have to be careful on your journey. It’s the same thing every time: safety first, always!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded faintly, and replied, “You too, eldest senior brother. Don’t force yourself if anything out of the ordinary happens in the Setting Sun Forest. You can wait for me to return, and I’ll go back there with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei smiled and said, “Don’t worry. If the Tang Sect can’t even deal with a patch of toxic miasma, then we would have grown so much and so long for nothing. Depending on the situation, I might even bring Teacher Xuan along on my journey. He has been working too hard, and he’s tired himself out too much over the past few years. It’s time for him to change his mood and his environment. Who knows? This journey might be beneficial for him in breaking through to become a Titled Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up as he said, “It can’t get any better if Teacher Xuan follows you.” Xuan Ziwen was a Class 8 soul engineer, and very close to becoming a Class 9 soul engineer. His soul tools were very powerful, and he wouldn’t be afraid of any dangers if Xuan Ziwen followed Bei Bei to the Icefire Yin Yang Well. Huo Yuhao just wasn’t sure to what extent the plants and herbs over there could help those two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears grow.</span></p>
