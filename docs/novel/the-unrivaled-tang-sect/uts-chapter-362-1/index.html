 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense booms erupted in a circle and mixed with the icy mist that had just exploded before they merged into an enormous tornado that rocketed into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This explosion was simply too frightening, as if the apocalyptic explosion that had just occurred in Radiant City was descending upon the city once more. Terrifying soul power undulations pushed the soul power detector to its limits, and it detonated with a protesting crack of metal. The soul engineers hurriedly soared into the sky, and even then, the extreme chill coming from beneath them made them shiver all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This horrifying and tremendous explosion covered everything within one thousand meters on the ground, and some structures that were still standing were instantly blown to smithereens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the soldiers and citizens in the region had already scattered, and not many lives were lost. However, this frightening explosion’s force and impact was clearly similar to that of a Titled Douluo’s all-out attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was meticulous and cautious. The more dangerous the situation, the calmer he was, and his judgments would still be accurate even if there were emotions stirring up his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had predicted that they would attract their enemies’ attention when he hid with Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi once more, and this was the reason why he opted to unleash his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice even though it would affect Xu Sanshi at the same time. Otherwise, with the strength that he would have had if he had teamed up with Wang Dong’er to unleash Mantra Amidst the Void, Spiritual Tempest, every single soul engineer on the scene would also have been eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul engineers that had been frozen into ice statues became Huo Yuhao’s timed explosive bombs for later, and his left hand was the most important entity that controlled these explosives and their detonations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ice Explosion was known as a godly skill of Ultimate Ice, and that claim wasn’t without substance. With the proper prerequisites met, Huo Yuhao could become even more frightening than seven-ringed and eight-ringed soul masters in larger battles like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the outcome even when Huo Yuhao didn’t used his hands to activate Ice Explosion and detonate the soul power within these soul engineers’ bodies directly. Otherwise, this explosion would have covered far more than just a kilometer; it’s impact would probably have reached the various soul engineers in the sky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s face was cold and solemn as they soared through the air. He was carrying Bei Bei in his arms, Xu Sanshi on his back, and his heart was full of peace and tranquility at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t even look back when the deafening explosion erupted behind him. The huge army in front of them was shifting around, so Huo Yuhao and the others changed directions a little before they ran through the cracks between those soldiers, while Wang Dong’er and Ye Guyi followed behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei’s breathing was weak, but his condition was stable, and all his vitals were normal. Xu Sanshi’s breathing had become a lot more regular and normal after he took some time to rest and adjust himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, Huo Yuhao suddenly thought of the White Tiger Duke’s personal guards who had jumped off the cliff for him before this. He suddenly understood why so many men chose to become soldiers, as only on the battlefield could they have that feeling where they were together in both life and in death, and only then could they feel the honor and glory of being valiant warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There had been a thought in his mind, and it was just a thought, but it grew and gestated like a seedling from the bottom of his heart. He had made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them finally broke free from the Sun Moon Empire’s encirclement by zipping in between the gaps between the Sun Moon Empire’s army units with Huo Yuhao’s Imitation. Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, which was shared with the others, and his Imitation were the most important reasons why they could escape so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some flatlands in front of them, but Huo Yuhao chose to stop in his tracks at this moment. He frowned faintly, and turned towards Ye Guyi with an awkward look on his face as he said, “Ye Guyi, this place is considered safe for now. But if we continue towards the west, we will run into another kind of danger. We have to continue forward, but you don’t have to. I can tell you everything about us now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m Huo Yuhao from Shrek Academy’s inner courtyard, and she is Wang Dong’er.. She’s my girlfriend, and she’s also from the inner courtyard. I don’t have time to explain my abilities to you for now. You should know the Sun Moon Empire’s connection to the Holy Ghost Church, and you have also seen how powerful they are. There’s no way for us to fight them by ourselves with our strength. If you are willing, you can join Shrek Academy: the academy’s doors will always be open to you, and your Angel should be enough for the inner courtyard to make an exception to take you in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er glanced at Huo Yuhao and gently touched his arm. Huo Yuhao had just introduced her to another pretty girl as his girlfriend, which proved how sweet he was to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi was taken aback when Huo Yuhao mentioned that he was from Shrek Academy. She knew of Shrek Academy, of course; as the number-one Academy on the continent, there were probably not many who didn’t know it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder! No wonder he has so many strange abilities. He’s actually from Shrek Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They hadn’t known each other for very long, but for some reason, Ye Guyi had an indescribable faith in Huo Yuhai… perhaps because Huo Yuhao had the chance to kill her a long time ago, but he didn’t do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me think about it,” Ye Guyi answered with a subtle frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Alright, I won’t force you. But I believe that we will become allies in the future, since we share the same enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was still conscious, and right at this moment, the plain voice that had already traumatized them a little rang out once more in their ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have passed this Deep Adventure. The second test has been narrowly completed, so everyone can proceed to the third round – Sincerity Adventure. You may return.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four faint gold and silver beams of light rose up from their bodies at the same time. Ye Guyi looked on with widened eyes and a slack jaw as all four of them vanished right before her eyes in an instant. Her body also drifted out from under the influence of Huo Yuhao’s Imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi patted herself on the forehead. Her mind was already numb, as Huo Yuhao had given her too many shocks and surprises, to the point where she had gotten used to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Should I go to Shrek Academy? I’ll think about that after I leave this place. I’ll circle around since I can’t travel to the west.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">-------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden rays flashed by one after another as the virtual world that they were in reverted to reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong’er, Bei Bei, and Xu Sanshi appeared one after another in an entirely new environment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They seemed to be inside an enormous courtyard. The courtyard’s boundaries couldn’t be seen with the naked eye, and there was a golden sun and a silver moon hanging in the sky to show that they were still under the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley’s control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four gold and silver beams surged from beneath their feet. However, these rays of light were no longer arresting their strengths and abilities. Huo Yuhao could clearly feel that the soul power and spiritual power he had expended before this were being restored with incredible speed, and even the faint fatigue in his body vanished under the warm radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei’s reaction was the most conspicuous one. His body drifted away from Huo Yuhao’s hands, and was gradually straightened while a dense mist nourished his body continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could tell at this point that everyone else who had disappeared before had reappeared in this place, except they didn’t have mist around their bodies. Everyone was standing around in a circle, and everyone had a dome over them, as if they were trapped and couldn’t leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone heaved deep sighs of relief as Huo Yuhao and the three others appeared before them, with the exception of Zhang Lexuan. Her pretty eyes flowed with worry and anxiety when she saw that Bei Bei was still unconscious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was the first to recover from his weakened state. He realized to his surprise that not only had his body recovered, but the old injuries that he had sustained from the tournament had also been healed. The Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley did have its mysterious and miraculous characteristics!</span></p>

He opened his eyes and saw everyone around him, and he understood that he had passed the previous test. He turned around towards Huo Yuhao and squinted at him. Bei Bei didn’t seem like he had just returned from the edge of death at all, and his classic scholarly disposition and his faint, amiable smile returned to him once more. His eyes unintentionally met the anxious look in Zhang Lexuan’s eyes, and his expression froze a little. However, his eyes only carried a little more awkwardness, as if everything had become a little more complicated.</span></p>

All kinds of scenery glimmered into view, and every single one that was either familiar or novel rotated back and forth in the sky. Every scene that flashed and flowed by would produce waves of intense suction force.</span></p>

They had no chance to resist those light beams at all, and everyone was taken away by those golden beams, one after another, vanishing in the blink of an eye.</span></p>

He sensed the space that was twisting and contorting around him and it made him dizzy, but he tried his best to regain his composure as much as possible.</span></p>

These experiences would be valuable for his growth if he could safely exit the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley...</span></p>

He knew from his past experiences that he had arrived at the location where he was supposed to face his third test.</span></p>

He was still inside a boundless golden courtyard; the only difference was that there was someone standing roughly ten meters away from him. This person was covered in faint bluish-golden light, and Huo Yuhao couldn’t see him clearly at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
