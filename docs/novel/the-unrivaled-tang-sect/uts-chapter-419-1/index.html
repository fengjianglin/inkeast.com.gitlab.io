He swept his tiger claws in front of him, but didn’t manage to hit anything. Following this, he felt a pain in his belly, and crashed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this, a strong force transmitted from below his waist, and he was lifted up. He was being lifted by Huo Yuhao’s left leg, and Huo Yuhao gave him a kick to his belly with his right leg, sending Dai Luoli flying away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli wasn’t concerned about the pain he had suffered. Instead, he shouted, “Who’s there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who had exclaimed didn’t run away, but emerged from the darkness. She was in disbelief as she looked at Huo Yuhao and Dai Luoli, who was crawling up from the ground. It was the beautiful battalion commander, Xu Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli’s expression immediately changed greatly when he saw Xu Yun. He blushed, and became extremely embarrassed. He couldn’t wait to find a hole to hide in. Huo Yuhao walked towards Xu Yun in a well-behaved manner and greeted her, “Battalion commander.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun quickly came in front of the two of them. She took a look at Dai Luoli before turning to Huo Yuhao. She was shocked as she asked, “You, you are unable to beat an ordinary soldier? Dai Luoli, you are regressing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli turned his head to one side. It was the truth that he couldn’t beat Huo Yuhao. However, the utter embarrassment he was subjected to after the goddess in his heart learned about this truth caused him to feel extremely tormented in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Battalion commander, you can’t put it this way either. We were only sparring. Furthermore, martial souls aren’t everything. That doesn’t mean that a person without a martial soul can’t be strong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun twisted her lips, “This means that you think you are one of those who are strong even without a martial soul? Bullshit. Without a martial soul, how can you be strong? Dai Luoli is just weak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gently shook his head and said, “He isn’t strong, but he isn’t the first person with a martial soul to lose to me. He won’t be the last either. I don’t think you can beat me either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun hadn’t expected Huo Yuhao to talk to her in such a manner even though he was only a mere small team leader, and after he knew her identity. Her expression changed immediately. She was about to burst out in anger, but suddenly thought of something, and said, “Alright. I’d like to try then. I’d like to see how you can defeat me without a martial soul. Dai Luoli, watch carefully. Don’t throw the face of soul masters in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Xu Yun finished speaking, Huo Yuhao lifted his right leg and kicked her belly. Xu Yun’s forte wasn’t her strength. While her cultivation was greater than Dai Luoli’s, she wasn’t as strong as he was. She was immediately kicked more than ten meters back, and bent her waist in excruciating pain. She squirmed in place and retched repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing?” Although Dai Luoli was embarrassed, he kept on stealing glances at Xu Yun. Seeing that Xu Yun had been kicked by Huo Yuhao, he was immediately frantic. He couldn’t be bothered with anything else, and quickly rushed to her side to help her up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked innocent as he said, “The battalion commander asked me to try! Should I not have attacked?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had kicked Xu Yun quite hard. She wasn’t wearing any armor right now, and only felt cramping pain coming from her belly. Her face was pale as she struggled to stand up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had always been pampered since she was young. Since when had she been beaten to such a state? She was completely furious because of her pride and the pain she had suffered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go to hell!” Xu Yun pushed Dai Luoli away, and her body started to shine brightly. Following this, her forehead also lit up, and a dazzling crown surfaced on her head. Beneath her feet, two yellow and two purple soul rings quickly rose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her cultivation was indeed greater than Dai Luoli’s. She was a four-ringed Soul Ancestor. Considering the fact that she looked younger than Dai Luoli, it was already pretty impressive that she possessed such a cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was slightly stunned when he saw her cultivation. He had seen such a martial soul before, and it indeed had some form of significance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a Starcrown, the strongest martial soul in the imperial family of the Star Luo Empire. Only those who had the direct bloodline of the imperial family could possess such a martial soul.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her surname is Xu, which means that she’s a member of the imperial family? No wonder Dai Luoli is so obsessed with her. She’s actually a princess. Perhaps this Xu Yun is Xu Jiujiu’s younger sister?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her identity as a princess was unable to affect Huo Yuhao’s current plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun unleashed her martial soul, and the pain she suffered in her belly lessened significantly as she adjusted her soul power. However, her face was still pale, and she pointed her finger at Huo Yuhao. Her second soul ring instantly shone, and her Starcrown slowly rose. Streaks of starlight shot towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was her second soul skill, Starlight Shine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun didn’t believe that an ordinary person could resist a soul master.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow actually dared to kick me when I wasn’t paying attention. He can’t be spared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she revealed the same look of astonishment as Dai Luoli when he first fought Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was shocked to discover that her Starlight Shine failed to take effect on Huo Yuhao, even though it was supposed to be able to lock onto her opponent. It failed to lock onto Huo Yuhao and Huo Yuhao avoided her streaks of starlight as he quickly shifted his body. At the same time, he was also rapidly inching closer to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little stunned when he saw Xu Yun’s soul skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Starcrown is indeed the strongest martial soul of the imperial family of the Star Luo Empire. The cultivation path that Xu Yun has chosen is different from Xu Jiujiu. Xu Jiujiu is a control-type soul master, while Xu Yun seems to focus on long-range attacks. In terms of talent, she’s slightly weaker than Xu Jiujiu. However, it’ll be difficult to tell who’s better once she cultivates to her higher standard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he thought of this, Huo Yuhao didn’t have any intention of going easy on her. As he charged forward, his spiritual power also engulfed Xu Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very relaxing for him to deal with Dai Luoli even without unleashing his martial soul and using his soul skills. However, Xu Yun was adept at long-range attacks, and her Starcrown was stronger then his mutated White Tiger. In addition, she also had four rings. It was thus much more difficult to deal with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that her Starlight Shine was ineffective, Xu Yun pointed her right hand towards the sky. Her Starcrown immediately gathered a ball of light with a diameter of over almost half a meter. It was as if a star had descended upon the mortal world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yun’er, you can’t harm him!” Dai Luoli weakly reminded her. However, Xu Yun was infuriated, and diddn’t heed his advice. She pointed her right hand at Huo Yuhao, and her third soul skill, Starburst, flew towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pure offensive soul skill, and it was extremely powerful. Once it blew apart, the explosive force generated could even compare to a ten thousand year soul skill. Its destructive strength was also rather great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even against her Starburst, Huo Yuhao was still fearless. He had his Spiritual Detection to support him. No matter what soul skill Xu Yun used, she wouldn’t be able to escape his detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the ball of starlight flying towards him, Huo Yuhao’s eyes flashed mysteriously, and Xu Yun suddenly felt giddy. At this instant, Huo Yuhao pointed his right hand at the ball of starlight, and it immediately flew forward even faster. Following this, he made a slashing gesture. An invisible force severed the connection between Xu Yun and the ball of starlight just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t let the ball of starlight touch him either. He deftly moved it through the air with his hands, guiding it to go around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun was shocked when she saw this scene. She had no idea how a person without a martial soul, or rather one who didn’t unleash his martial soul, was able to resist her Starburst in such a manner. How was this possible?</span></p>

Instantly, he returned her Starburst. He was returning to her what she had tried to inflict on him. It was tit for tat!</span></p>

Huo Yuhao’s guess was right. She was the youngest princess of the Star Luo Empire, and was doted on by her brothers and sisters since she was young. She didn’t have any significant fighting experience! She came to be a soldier at her own request, as she wanted to contribute to her empire. Xu Jiujiu had no choice but to deploy her younger sister to the reserves. In her opinion, as long as Xu Yun didn’t have to go onto a battlefield, she would return after she got tired of military life.</span></p>

She had no intention of returning. The reserves were extremely safe, and thus Xu Jiujiu wasn’t worried about her younger sister’s safety, and left her to her own devices.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Xu Yun was stunned in place after witnessing the miracle Huo Yuhao performed. The Starburst she had unleashed earlier was now in front of her.</span></p>

After this, he leaped and blocked for Xu Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao silently shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silly kid. He should have pinned her to the ground. Since he was going to sacrifice himself to save her, he should have taken the opportunity to get closer to her.</span></p>

Although he was a little stubborn, he was a kind person.</span></p>

When she saw Dai Luoli using his arms to block her, she seemed slightly moved.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fool...</span></p>

In the blink of an eye, he had already run several dozen meters away. His voice also sounded from afar, “Aren’t you going to run considering the huge commotion that we’ve just caused? Aren’t you afraid of being dealt with by those from the Military Law Department?”</span></p>

What had happened tonight was a huge blow to her. If not for Dai Luoli earlier, would her own Starburst have struck her? She was most familiar with the power of her attacks. The strength of her Starburst was great enough to leave her critically hurt.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was that person just now?
