 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was much simpler for Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. They didn’t even need to put on makeup. Through Imitation, they managed to retain their youthful looks, but their appearances changed. For example, Tang Wutong’s eyes became smaller, and her pinkish-blue hair turned brown, a common hair color in the Sun Moon Empire. Some minor changes also made her look more ordinary. Although she still appeared delicate, she was not as ravishing as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi smiled when he saw how they looked. He said, “Not bad. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After walking out of the dark alleyway, they didn’t need to avoid the ordinary surveillance soul tools due to their camouflage. They righteously walked onto the streets and found an inn to stay in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Radiant City was very prosperous. Ever since the Sun Moon Empire occupied two-thirds of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s land, Xu Tianran consolidated his position in the empire even further. His throne was now very stable, especially after Ju Zi bore him a Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran and Ju Zi named their son Xu Yunhan. One month after his birth, he was named the Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For an empire, a Crown Prince represented its future. Furthermore, Xu Tianran was disabled. This made a Crown Prince even more paramount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since the Crown Prince was named, some of the doubts that came from the imperial family disappeared. Xu Tianran was finally respected as the Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was also well-loved by the Sun Moon Empire’s citizens. The story of how she became the Empress spread widely. She was just an ordinary civilian who was saved by Xu Tianran when he was still a Crown Prince. After that, she hurt herself seriously to save him, which touched him. Eventually, she became the Empress. With Xu Tianran’s help, Ju Zi slowly revealed her extraordinary talent in military matters. After Xu Tianran ascended to the throne, she accumulated merits and became the Marshal of the Three Armies, leading the Sun Moon Empire’s army in its domination over the Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Sun Moon Empire, the story that spread was that the Heavenly Soul Empire would have been completely annexed if not for the fact that Ju Zi was pregnant, and had to return to the empire to nurse her baby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was also known as a Goddess of War. In some areas, she was even more outstanding than Xu Tianran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Undoubtedly, everything about Ju Zi was intentionally spread under Xu Tianran’s orders. First, it was a means of making amends to her. Second, Xu Tianran was disabled and couldn’t do many things on his own. He needed someone he trusted to perform tasks for him. Ju Zi was a female. If she wanted to be in the limelight, she needed to be more glorious. This was why Xu Tianran did so much to ensure that she shone as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there was one more reason why she was being pushed into the limelight. This was because she had earned the recognition of the Sun Moon Empire’s army. In a few fights, she demonstrated her talent, and won over many generals. Whenever she was involved in a fight, the Sun Moon Empire always made headway. When she returned to the empire, things changed at the frontline. She had earned her reputation as a Goddess of War.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After settling down, Huo Yuhao told the Body Douluo before bringing Tang Wutong out to roam the streets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, aren’t you going to ask the Body Douluo about the true goal of this mission?” Tang Wutong asked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Why should I ask if he doesn’t want to tell? I think we aren’t the only ones in the dark. Many of the Titled Douluo on this mission probably don’t know the true goal of this mission. Only the Body Douluo and Heavenly Sun Douluo know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My mentality is different from before. I was fearless in the past. Then, I didn’t have you by my side. I didn’t know whether I could find you. However, things are different now. With you by my side, my greatest mission is to bring you back safely. I also hope to return safely with you. That’s enough. That’s why I’m not probing too much. Why should I bring more trouble to myself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stopped in her tracks. As Huo Yuhao was holding her hand, he also naturally stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong looked at him, and there seemed to be something in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and asked, “What? Are you touched?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong lifted her hand and caressed his face. “Yuhao, you’ve matured.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grabbed her hand. “You’ve recovered your memories this time and returned to my side. I’ve thought over many things clearly. I don’t want to be a hero that saves the world. I don’t care about my reputation either. You are the most important thing in my heart. As long as you are by my side, so what if I lose the world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I worked tirelessly in my cultivation and improved myself in the hope that I could better protect you and my loved ones. Wutong, I love you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very calm. So was his gaze. However, it was his words that made Tang Wutong tear up a little, and she was gently pulled into his embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me too. I love you too, Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to hug her too tightly. He wasn’t afraid of being attacked by the seal, but afraid of attracting attention if he triggered it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They only hugged gently. However, he still felt very warm in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a commotion could be heard on the streets. Fully armored Soldiers were running over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soldiers were all very tall and large. As they ran over, they appeared very domineering. They didn’t try to avoid anyone at all. Those who couldn’t react in time were knocked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao were on the streets too, but they couldn’t reveal their extraordinary speed right now. Huo Yuhao could only turn his body and block Tang Wutong. At the same time, he pushed her as they got out of the soldiers’ way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldier running at the front knocked into Huo Yuhao’s back. The resultant force did nothing to worry Huo Yuhao. However, he still staggered a few steps to the side. He even let out a groan. His acting was top-grade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little annoyed as he said, “These people are really party poopers!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong chuckled and commented, “This is not the effect of my father’s seal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bystanders on the streets were also displeased. Of course, they weren’t too loud with their complaints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s the Imperial Guards again. They’re revolting. They don’t treat us as humans at all. Recently, His Majesty has wanted to organize a Grand Sacrificial Ceremony. These Imperial Guards have been coming out of the palace on many occasions, and we’re the ones suffering for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imperial Guards?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted. In the Sun Moon Empire, the imperial family held the greatest power. Among them, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was naturally the strongest. They are also called the Imperial Court Soul Engineer Legion, and were the strongest among the Hand that Protects the Nation. The Imperial Palace of Consecration, also known as the Research Institute, was next. As for how strong the Sun Moon Empire was, no one fully knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was going to be a Grand Sacrificial Ceremony. However, Huo Yuhao realized that assassinating Xu Tianran was almost impossible after entering Radiant City. Xu Tianran controlled the core strength of the Sun Moon Empire right now. How was it going to be easy to kill him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After making turns along the streets and grabbing a bite to eat, Huo Yuhao brought Tang Wutong back to their inn. Once they entered, he heard Du Busi’s voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked Tang Wutong to return to their room first. He came to Du Busi’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi was in a single room on his own. The other two Titled Douluo from the Body Sect also had their own rooms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw Huo Yuhao, Du Busi raised his hand. The entire room was suddenly covered by a dim-green glow. If one wasn’t observant enough, they wouldn’t be able to detect any difference. However, Huo Yuhao was horrified to discover that his Spiritual Detection had been isolated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At Du Busi’s level and cultivation, his soul and spiritual power were almost completely fused. He was like Elder Xuan before – one step from becoming an Ultimate Douluo. However, it was a pity that he didn’t have a Qiankun Fortune Pill to help him. In addition, he was critically hurt before. It would take some time before he could complete that last step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is it? Did you discover anything while you were out?” Du Busi asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “Things are normal in Radiant City. The surveillance soul tools in the city have covered almost the entire city. However, more surveillance soul tools are pointed towards the outside of the city rather than inside the city. The Grand Sacrificial Ceremony is indeed in progress. Everything fits the information that we’ve been given.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi nodded and replied, “Yuhao, we have another mission apart from assassinating Xu Tianran.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao was shocked as he stared at Du Busi. Even though he had already deduced that, he was still astonished when Du Busi mentioned it. He knew exactly what this meant. It was Du Busi’s recognition of him. However, at the same time, it also meant that Du Busi was dragging him into this mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao started to regret having come. He was too young. If not for the fact that he had performed very well all this while, Du Busi wouldn’t have recognized his abilities. If that didn’t happen, he wouldn’t be roped in on this side mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued to act stunned as he asked, “What other mission is there? Are you talking about bombing the munitions warehouse?”</span></p>
