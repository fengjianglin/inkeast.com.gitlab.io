 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

As someone from the Star Luo Empire, no matter how much I hate the family, I have to serve my country. I’ll use my power to help my country resists its foreign foes. At the same time, I have to slowly progress to his position, and maybe even surpass it. Only like this can I force him to repent before my mother’s grave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er sighed visibly and said, “Yuhao, you really have changed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “I don’t hate the world as much I used to when I was young, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Teacher once asked me, what’s the goal of life? At that time, I replied ‘revenge’ without any hesitation. That was my desire. In other words, my hard work was primarily driven by a strong desire for revenge. However, teacher then asked me, ‘What comes after revenge?’ I couldn’t answer him. At that time, I didn’t know what I’d do after I got my revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher then said, ‘I don’t expect you to go and save humanity, but I hope that you can be a good person. Since you have no goal for your future, let me give you this goal.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then, confused, I asked teacher, ‘What’s the definition of a good person?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher smiled, and told me, ‘To make more people smile.’”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Huo Yuhao suddenly paused and frowned for a moment, before continuing. “If there’s war, no one knows how many people will perish. No one knows how many people will become refugees. Hence, I hope that by taking part in the war, I’ll be able to shorten it. Once the war ends, many people will smile happily. Of course, if possible, I hope that there will be no war to begin with. However, what I can do is still too limited.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei was shocked by what Huo Yuhao had said. He had never expected his little brother to say such things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was shocked too. She gripped Huo Yuhao’s hand and said softly, “I want to be a good person, too. When you do all this, I’ll always be by your side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei suddenly smiled. He placed his hand on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder and said, “Earlier, I felt that the Tang Sect lacked an ideal or goal. However, I believe I have found it now. Thank you, Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them looked at each other and smiled. Nothing needed to be said. At this moment, the arena had been cleaned up, and the second round of the fight for the top eight was about to start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

At this stage, if anyone wanted to win, they had to use all their strength. Hence, this was the best time to observe their opponents, which is why they had arrived early. While Wang Qiu’er had left, along with the other female teammates, the rest of the team from Shrek Academy, such as Dai Huabing, Xie Xuanyue, Zhou Sichen, Cao Jinxuan, and a few others, stayed behind to watch and make preparations. The winner of this fight, be it the Proudsword Sect or the Heavenly Dragon Sect, would be their opponent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The competition was still being refereed by the Unbreakable Douluo and Class 9 soul engineer, Zheng Zhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first people both sides sent out were both big, tall youths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The competitor from the Proudsword Sect wore tight-fitting green clothes. He was at least 1.8 meters tall, and while he had to be under twenty years old, he looked very mature. His shoulders were broad, and his arms exceptionally long. In particular, his hands were large, and his fingers were long and thick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw this person walking up on stage, Ji Juechen had the biggest reaction among everyone from the Tang Sect. A razor-sharp sword qi started rising from him. While it was momentary, it caught the attention of everyone from the Tang Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen narrowed his eyes. There was a fanatical look in his eyes at this moment. He tapped lightly on the armrest of his seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Jing Ziyan had seen this reaction from him often. It meant that his desire to fight was at its maximum, and he was itching to act. Evidently, the youth from the Proudsword Sect had aroused this sentiment in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, a youth in tight-fitting red clothes appeared. He was also tall and strongly built, but he was slightly shorter than the youth from the Proudsword Sect, yet appeared much firmer and broader. His hair, which looked as hard as metal, was orange-red and short.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of them were extremely powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thanks to Wang Qiu’er’s stunning performance in the individual round, every team now sent their most powerful teammate out in the first round. If not, they would suffer like the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy and the Radiant City Soul Engineering Academy, and be at a disadvantage and lose their momentum. That was not a good thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, even if the two of them were not the most powerful members of the Proudsword Sect and the Heavenly Dragon Sect, they were not that far off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“State your names.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Proudsword Sect, Wu Yifan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavenly Dragon Sect, Xing Yan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two youths stated their names, but they fixed their gazes firmly on one another. A powerful intent to fight could clearly be felt by both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please retreat and prepare for the competition.” While Zheng Zhan felt stifled in the previous round, it had ended, and he was now finally able to relax. At this moment, as he refereed a match between two comparatively normal sects, he appeared to be in a much better mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two competitors retreated to their respective ends of the arena. As they turned to face each other, their eyes started to shine. A powerful and unbridled fighting intent was rising up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right after Zheng Zhan said that, Xing Yan from the Heavenly Dragon Sect struck first. He took one step out and with a bang, his entire body shot forward like a cannon shell. In mid-air, two yellow, two purple, and two black soul rings appeared. He was an elite! Not only was he a six-ringed Soul Emperor, but he also had the ideal soul ring combination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, why did his fighting style look so familiar…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in the audience had the same thought in their mind… his fighting style seemed to resemble Wang <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu’er</span>’s. However, his explosive violent strength was slightly weaker than hers, not quite as terrifying and unstoppable. Even so, his overall style resembled hers quite closely. In mid-air, his first soul ring started to shine. A layer of thick, Scarlet Dragon scales enveloped his entire body instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was his martial soul, the Scarlet Dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A deafening dragon roar rang from his mouth. Xing Yan’s body doubled in size. His thick body was covered with dragon scales, including even his face. Evidently, he was not too far from becoming a seven-ringed Soul Sage, who could reveal his Martial Soul True Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Wu Yifan was no ordinary person either. Faced with his charging opponent, he stepped out and positioned his index and middle fingers together. Then, he pointed forward with both fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, a roar could be heard. A wide green sword appeared in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Likewise, two yellow, two purple, and two black soul rings appeared. However, they did not appear on Wu Yifan’s body, but instead, on his sword.</span></p>

The soul rings of normal soul masters would shine brightly when they unleashed their soul skills, the halo expanding outward or increasing in size. However, Wu Yifan’s soul ring was different. The first soul ring shone on his green sword and started to contract, and was completely absorbed into his sword.</span></p>

In terms of explosive strength, he was not as powerful as Wang Qiu’er, the gold dragon girl, and so naturally was much slower. If Wang Qiu’er were the attacker, Wu Yifan could still use his sword qi, but by the time it reached her, Wang Qiu’er might already be in front of him. Right now, Xing Yan was still twenty meters away!</span></p>

He made a circle with his hands, and an intense, dark-red light appeared on his dragon claws. It went straight for the sword qi.</span></p>

The reason was simple. The martial souls of all the disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Sect were dragons! Some dragon martial souls were weak, while others were strong. However, they had all inherited the haughty elegance of dragons!</span></p>

Hence, the students and teachers of the sect researched Wang Qiu’ér’s fighting style and studied its essence. Then, they taught it to their disciples!</span></p>

The benefit of this was not only in appearing powerful. Through the Heavenly Dragon Sect’s careful analysis, this was the best way for the two sides to come into contact in the shortest possible time. At the same time, they could also suppress their opponents in terms of aura. This was an excellent way to fight if you were a more powerful soul master!</span></p>

The green sword qi was shattered by Xing Yan’s punch. However, he felt a pain shoot through his fist, and wounds could be seen on his scales.</span></p>

His strong right hand gripped the handle of the sword. The tips of his toes touched the floor, and then he leapt into the air. He now wielded his sword with both hands as he charged toward Xing Yan.</span></p>

A powerful aura expanded from him, the sword qi within it evident. A sword light three inches thick could be seen on his sword. The air in front of him was shattering, and at the tip of the sword, a black void appeared!</span></p>
