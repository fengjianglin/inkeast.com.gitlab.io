 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were fine golden waves rippling continuously around the black hole. These golden waves gradually froze and took shape, and Huo Yuhao discovered to his surprise that they actually took a strange eye-like shape, while the black hole in the middle was the pupil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This… is this my soul core?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was watching him from the beginning to the end. At this time, he shared the same shock and astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had formed his own soul core as a Soul Sage. This was the first time he had heard of such a thing, let alone seen one! He had witnessed a miracle happen with own eyes, and was filled with pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he had obtained some inspirations from Huo Yuhao when he was compressing his mixture. Huo Yuhao’s compression method was different from typical soul masters. He was clearly using a lot more spiritual power than soul power, and when his element finally fused with his soul core, his martial soul seemed to become his main guide. This order looked very important. In the instant when the soul core collapsed inward, its soul power undulations were unnaturally stable, and it didn’t need any external strength to control it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul core had been formed in that moment, and it no longer absorbed Huo Yuhao’s soul power. It was only gently absorbing the origin energy of heaven and earth in the air. However, the deep darkness within it and the aura of the mixture itself clearly gave Elder Xuan a feeling that this core wasn’t that much different from that of a Transcendent Douluo. The only difference was that it was a little smaller.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, try to absorb it. However, you have to be very careful! If you feel like your body can’t take it anymore, release it immediately. You’ll have to risk regressing your cultivation instead of forcing yourself. Otherwise, this soul core can obliterate you with its power. You should feel whether your body can take its power once it enters you. Remember,don’t force yourself! If you feel even a little bit like you’re forcing yourself, don’t fuse with the soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Huo Yuhao steeled his nerves. He was still very much overcome by surprise, because he realized that soul power was coming back into his body after it was empty of it. Furthermore, his soul power was recovering faster than before, and his spiritual power was recovering at a similar speed. Everything seemed connected to this soul core!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t overly hasty to absorb the soul core. Instead, he crossed his legs and sat down in front of it. He channeled his soul power quietly as he replenished it while observing any changes that were happening in the mixture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was momentarily stunned before he said hurriedly, “Wait for a moment before you absorb it, your soul core seems different from most. It’s far too stable, and it doesn’t seem like it will lose control or become unstable even without your control. If that’s the case, you can try recovering all your soul power and spiritual power before attempting to absorb it. Don’t worry, I will observe from the side, and will immediately warn you if something is wrong with it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded toward Elder Xuan. His own feelings were identical to those of Elder Xuan, except this was his first time forming a soul core, so he didn’t know what it was supposed to be like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan drew a cold breath. This was the first time he had seen such a stable soul core that was almost near perfection. Did this mean that soul masters could create a soul core such as this before becoming a Transcendent Douluo, as long as their spiritual power far exceeded their soul power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Typically, Titled Douluo would have to immediately absorb their soul cores after completing them when they were breaking through to become a Transcendent Douluo. Otherwise, if their soul cores became unstable, everything that they had worked for could possibly be for nothing, while the soul core could possibly hurt their body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s soul core was different from the rest. It was so stable that it was almost like a normal object. Quite a long time had passed since the soul core was formed, but it was still extremely stable. The way it absorbed the origin energy of heaven and earth wasn’t as forceful and ferocious as that of a Transcendent Douluo’s soul core, but this kind of stability was even more precious and hard to come by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like Huo Yuhao might have a chance to fuse with his soul core successfully!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;This was just unimaginable. Elder Xuan was witnessing yet another miracle from Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time continued to pass. Huo Yuhao’s soul power and spiritual power were recovering at an astonishing speed, and it took him less than an hour before he reopened his eyes, back to his peak condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can I begin, Elder Xuan?” Huo Yuhao turned toward Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was astonished. “Your soul power and spiritual power have recovered?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan didn’t ask any further. Instead, he tilted his head and said, “Then yes, you may begin. Remember what I said before: it would be better for you to not complete the fusion than take any risks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged and turned his gaze toward his soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could feel a boundless and terrifying existence inside his soul core that could consume everything, just like when he was observing it before. When he stared at it, he immediately felt an incredibly strong attractive force that seemed like it wanted to pull his spirit into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao closed his eyes and opened his Eye of Destiny. Rose-gold patterns immediately shone from his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny gazed at the black hole, and realized, to his surprise, that he had a feeling as if his Eye of Destiny was staring at itself, as if the black hole was what it would be like after his Eye of Destiny was magnified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was just so unimaginable. Huo Yuhao didn’t have to control it; his Eye of Destiny naturally produced a strange gravitational force that pulled the black hole towards him. The faint golden light around the black hole also began to shrink, and even its original body was contracting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By the time the black hole was only a few meters in front of Huo Yuhao, it had shrunk to the same size as his Eye of Destiny. Golden light patterns shone from both ends, and it fit itself against his Eye of Destiny as if it was imprinting onto it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s eyes widened. He understood what Huo Yuhao wanted to do – he wasn’t just about to fuse with his soul core. The location that he chose wasn’t his dantian, a location that was easier for a soul master to absorb his soul core into. Instead, he chose the center of his eyebrows, the hardest place to accomplish fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Typically, even Transcendent Douluo breaking through to become an Ultimate Douluo would choose the chest instead of between the eyebrows when forming their second soul core. The reason was because the space between the eyebrows was too close to the brain, and a single mistake could threaten their life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao’s situation was different from everyone else. Spiritual power was his forte, and in the process of forming his soul core, his spiritual power helped his soul core become very stable. His martial soul was Spirit Eyes, while the space between his eyebrows was one of three locations that could absorb soul cores, and so close to his martial soul’s location at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao’s idea wasn’t impossible! He would leave his dantian empty so that he could store another soul core there when he was breaking through to become a Titled Douluo. In that case, he could wield two soul cores when becoming a Titled Douluo. Elder Xuan thought about his twin martial souls, and felt that this path that Huo Yuhao had chosen was most suitable for him. He exhaled deeply as he remained amazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the first time, Elder Xuan felt that he could no longer teach this little fellow in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden lights pressed together as his soul core slid in. Huo Yuhao’s body trembled, and two beams of rose-gold light blasted from his eyes as if they were two materialized swords. Elder Xuan wasn’t far from him, and took a step back subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Eye of Destiny shone with light between the center of his eyebrows, and its sun patterns seemed like they were being reinvigorated. They layered together as they glowed and stretched out from his forehead to the space between his eyebrows. The sun patterns looked like they were growing, and quickly stretched over his entire forehead. Huo Yuhao’s hair drifted into the air and danced in midair, even though there was no wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt as if a terrifying and indescribable power had been injected into his spiritual sea. This power was like a sharp cone splitting his head apart, and felt like it was about to suck his spiritual sea dry, trying to really open up another eye on his head. That agonizing feeling gave him feel a clear sensation of being shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s path could be said to have been forged through pain and agony ever since the day he had fused with the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. He possessed many abilities that soul masters couldn’t even begin to imagine. However, he had to sustain countless instances of unimaginable pain to gain such abilities!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His strength increased after every episode of agony. At the same time, every instance strengthened his spiritual resolve and endurance. His pain tolerance was not something that normal people could match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards the end, Dong’er and Qiu’er left him one after another, and he almost broke down because he had suffered too much pain in his heart. He had grown after that, grown from a young boy to a young adult, and a true warrior!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this moment, Huo Yuhao’s body was still trembling intensely as he was struck by this agonizing pain. His lower body was still stable, and his hands were clenched tightly into fists. However, he was subconsciously channeling his Mysterious Heaven Technique with his full strength. Immense spiritual power swirled within his spiritual sea at his whim to resist the intense pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four large Spirits hovered above his spiritual sea. They knew that everything that was happening was very important to Huo Yuhao. With the exclusion of the Skydream Iceworm, who had sacrificed his origin power, the other three Spirits were all using their consciousnesses to protect his spiritual sea so that it wouldn’t shatter.</span></p>
