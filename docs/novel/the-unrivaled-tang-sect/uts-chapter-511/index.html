 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given these problems, Shrek Academy was desperately in need of outstanding individuals who were capable of countering the upper echelon of the Holy Ghost Church. Although Elder Xuan was only a single step away from becoming an Ultimate Douluo, he clearly knew how difficult it was to the step to Rank 99.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Yan Shaozhe and XIan Lin’er, they were still very far from becoming Ultimate Douluo, despite already being Transcendent Douluo. They weren’t the only ones that were far away either—every soul master within Shrek Academy shared this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As things stood, what could they do in the face of an Ultimate Douluo? Contrary to expectations, an opportunity had presented itself in the younger generation of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honestly speaking, it was impossible for Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong to become Transcendent Douluo any time soon. However, there was still something special about them! Yesterday, all of the Sea God’s Pavillion’s elders had been astonished by the strength of their unleashed fusion skills. With their strength, how acute were their senses? The instant that each skill was unleashed, they’d been able to clearly sense that both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s abilities had increased to the point that it left all of them shocked. This was definitely not something normally achievable by an eight-ringed Soul Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were extremely talented. Furthermore, their fusion skills were the foundation for miracles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result of this, the academy had considered their options, before deciding that they would do everything in their power to help the pair improve their abilities. They would be the key to dealing with the Holy Ghost Church in the near future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, Huo Yuhao didn’t know the elder’s intentions. To him, Yan Shaozhe was simply here present to test their fighting strength. Of course, this was also part of the elder’s plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aura released by their fusion skills was one thing, but the strength they contained was another. With sufficient pressure, they would either collapse, or demonstrate an even greater level of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single elder of Shrek Academy was a research expert with many years of teaching experience. They all wanted to see just how much Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong would improve from this fight, as well as how much help they could offer to the pair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded at Huo Yuhao. Her gaze became sharper, and her strong belief flowed through his body alongside their Haodong Power. The name of this belief was ‘victory’!i</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though she knew how difficult such a feat would be, she was still determined to win. This was one of the qualities that a truly strong individual should possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao had rekindled their knowledge of one another. She wasn’t just his girlfriend, but his teammate and partner as well. Once, they’d fought side-by-side not long after entering the academy. Ten years later, today, they were still side-by-side, yet they now had the ability to challenge the Dean of Shrek’s Martial Soul Department. How could they not be excited?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he sensed Tang Wutong’s strong fighting intent, Huo Yuhao’s initially depressed emotions were wiped away.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve already promised to protect her. Since she’s so intent on winning, how could I cower away?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He rapidly circulated his soul power and interlinked it with Tang Wutong’s, their Haodong Power fusing once agian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He discovered that a part of Tang Wutong’s soul power had been filtered out, and that this portion was contained within the sunray pattern of the golden trident on her forehead. Without that portion of her soul power, she was like the old Wang Dong’er; her martial soul was still the Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t have any idea what that portion of her strength was. However, it was evident that it was of a higher standard than his own soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, their martial souls hadn’t been able to fuse due to this portion of her soul power. This had been why there’d been so many misunderstandings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao knew that Tang Wutong’s fighting strength would be somewhat affected if she didn’t use that portion of her soul power. However, this was two-sided, as it also meant that their Haodong Power could finally fuse. This was also what they were relying on to challenge Yan Shaozhe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong looked at each other, before nodding. A strong aura emerged from both of them, while the will to win appeared in both of their eyes as they grasped each other’s hand. Currently, the feeling that they gave off was as if they were both the same entity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he sensed the strong fighting intent coming from them, Yan Shaozhe nodded and smiled. “Very good. Let’s head to the practice arena. Just do your best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone followed Yan Shaozhe to the practice arena, which turned out to be the same place that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had been at together yesterday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides the three of them, everyone else stood around the perimeter. Meanwhile, a few of the elders—led by Elder Xuan—set up restrictions around the arena. Soon afterwards, a giant barrier engulfed the arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This practice arena had been constructed atop a mountain. When the restrictions were finished being constructed, they appeared very striking. The dim yellow glow of the barrier engulfed the entirety of the mountain-top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong held each other’s hand as they stood opposite Yan Shaozhe. Their soul power interlinked as it flowed, and their Haodong Power surged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s physical strength exceeded others of the same rank, even after he’d gained his eighth soul ring. With the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, Life’s Gold, and the dragon pill that Long Xiaoyao had given him, he wasn’t affected much despite how vigorous their Haodong Power was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao simply felt like the soul power inside of him was surging. At times, it felt like whirlpools would appear. His purely fluid soul power was extremely pure; in fact, there were no impurities in it at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When such strong soul power flowed into Tang Wutong’s body, she didn’t seem to feel uncomfortable at all either. Evidently, she was also strong enough to handle it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their soul powers were completely compatible. The fusion of their fighting strength was more than them just adding their fighting strength together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their auras quickly rose, after which their strong fighting intent surged towards Yan Shaozhe and suppressed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe smiled, and his body exuded a golden glow. Suddenly, the air within ten square meters of him started to ripple; it was as if was being baked by a strong fire. Under such a situation, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s immense fighting intent couldn’t directly locate Yan Shaozhe’s body, and could only remain suspended in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, little juniors. Show me how strong you two can get once you’ve fused your martial souls.” Yan Shaozhe’s voice echoed. Following this, a sonorous phoenix roar shook the sky, and an aura that had been repressed earlier was suddenly unleashed. A strong intent suddenly collided with Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s fighting intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the air of the practice arena became extremely violent. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s clothes creaked as they were blown about, but neither retreated. Huo Yuhao released a golden glow from his body, while a blue glow emerged from Tang Wutong’s. The two glows then intersected and fused with one another, before spreading outwards and disintegrating the strong intent that Yan Shaozhe had unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan and the others from Shrek nodded slightly when they saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After fusing their martial souls, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were already as strong a Titled Douluo. Furthermore, they weren’t simply as strong as a normal Titled Douluo. Else, they wouldn’t have been able to hold their ground against a Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Promising talents, promising talents! If they both become Titled Douluo in the future, they might just stand a chance against an Ultimate Douluo together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded in satisfaction after he thought this. Next up, it was time to see how effective their skills were in a real fight. Under sufficient pressure, their fighting strength would definitely be fully unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was the first to make a move, as a rose-gold vertical eye slowly opened on his forehead. When facing someone like Yan Shaozhe, how could he afford to hold back? He’d immediately decided to use his strongest ability, the Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his Eye of Destiny opened, a strong light flashed, and layers of blinding light filled the air. Afterwards, the circulation of all energy bodies around him seemed to slow down, and both Tang Wutong and his body’s started to become illusory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his Spiritual Interference Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only that, but Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection engulfed the entire practice arena like a web, and he shared it with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given his current spiritual prowess, and the small range he was focusing on, he was able to see everything in the practice arena in minute detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Yan Shaozhe had concealed himself, Huo Yuhao was able to immediately locate him the moment that he fully unleashed his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual power was already at the standard for a Titled Douluo. Furthermore, only a spiritual-type Titled Douluo could compare to him in terms of spiritual power, as his spiritual power had reached the concrete-material realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven soul rings shone from his body, while eight flashed from Tang Wutong’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since only seven soul rings were present, it meant that Huo Yuhao was currently using his Spirit Eyes, rather than that his eight-ringed Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fourth soul ring flashed, after which a whirlpool-shaped glow appeared above Yan Shaozhe. It was Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had long ago thought of a fighting strategy for Yan Shaozhe: If he wanted to overcome him and emerge victorious, his only option was to take the initiative. Only through assaulting and controlling Yan Shaozhe could he prevent this Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo from unleashing his full abilities. They would only stand a chance if that happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why Huo Yuhao had immediately used his Spiritual Interference Domain to protect Tang Wutong and himself initially. Afterwards, he’d used his Spiritual Confusion to overpower Yan Shaozhe and control him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Spiritual Confusion was a single-target control-type soul skill. While it was only his Spirit Eyes’ fourth soul skill, it was the strongest and most effective soul skill he had when it came to controlling a single person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s body turned slightly rigid when he was struck by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Confusion, and a slightly lost look appeared in his eyes for an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Huo Yuhao’s vertical eye lit up, and a blinding, rose-gold light shot out. This time, it was his Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spiritual Shock from his Eye of Destiny might not be as strong as it was when he was in his Martial Soul True Body, but it could be used quickly. There was no accumulation needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao didn’t expect Yan Shaozhe to suddenly take half a step forwards despite suffering from his Spiritual Confusion. Afterwards, his body turned entirely golden, and a golden phoenix opened its wings behind him. Yan Shaozhe seemed to have safely entered his own world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock struck him, Huo Yuhao felt as if his attack had struck nothing but air. At the same time, though, it didn’t quite feel as if the air it had struck was completely empty. However, the full strength of his Spiritual Shock wasn’t completely unleashed due to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time that Huo Yuhao had seen something like this. He’d only seen Yan Shaozhe exude a golden ring of light from his body, before returning to normal, despite his body being in a momentary state of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Yan Shaozhe’s realm. It was similar to Elder Mu’s Sovereign’s Descent. However, Yan Shaozhe’s realm wasn’t the same as Sovereign’s Descent. Yan Shaozhe’s own understanding was blended into it, something that belonged solely to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could the chief disciple of the Dragon God Douluo Mu En be so easily defeated? Huo Yuhao’s immense Spiritual Shock had been blocked, just like that! Huo Yuhao was the one left somewhat shocked instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only one who’d attacked. Tang Wutong had made her move, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings opened up behind her back as her soul rings rose. When Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Shock, Tang Wutong had mimed a lifting action. Afterwards, a golden Hexagram Array had accurately appeared beneath Yan Shaozhe’s feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong had calculated everything precisely. Even if Yan SHaozhe managed to block Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock, he’d still be affected by it and the Spiritual Confusion he’d previously been struck with. He wouldn’t be able to avoid her Hexagram Array then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the part of her memory that belonged to Wang Dong’er had only been restored for a short period of time, her coordination with Huo Yuhao seemed to come extremely naturally. Whenever their Haodong Power re-appeared, their chemistry re-appeared alongside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Tang Wutong had expected, Yan Shaozhe wasn’t completely fine despite managing to resist Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock. When the intense golden light from the Hexagram Array engulfed his body, he wasn’t able to escape from the spot he was standing at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s sixth soul ring suddenly lit up as he did so. At the same time, the vertical eye on his forehead instantly changed from rose-gold to black and white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Elder Xuan and those sitting outside of the arena shuddered when they saw this black and white vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sense of crisis almost instantly appeared in everyone’s heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What soul skill was this?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone from Shrek Academy was already very clear in regards to Huo Yuhao’s abilities. They knew that he was strong, but they didn’t know that he could unleash a skill capable of making everyone present feel as if they were in a crisis.</span></p>
