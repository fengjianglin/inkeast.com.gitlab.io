 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had gone silent. Even Zhongli Wu, who had been brimming with confidence, became quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the two hours before the battle, Zhongli Wu had made a series of plans, and Wu Yun was the first pawn he had decided to send out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was definitely able to guess what Ju Zi had managed to guess. Huo Yuhao must have the necessary credentials to possess the courage to step forward and challenge ten opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On top of that, Zhongli Wu must have tried to understand Huo Yuhao’s abilities and fighting style. He knew Huo Yuhao was but a Titled Douluo. Hence, his plan was carefully constructed with several considerations in mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu only had a single objective for sending Wu Yun out in the first battle. He wanted to use the strength and viscosity of &nbsp;Wu Yun’s dark-type powers to burn away Huo Yuhao’s soul power. This would create opportunities for the subsequent opponents Huo Yuhao would have to face. In fact, Zhongli Wu had instructed Wu Yun to surrender when necessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, it was not easy to nurture an evil soul master to a Titled Douluo. Furthermore, Wu Yun had just successfully become a Transcendent Douluo. Once he was able to consolidate his abilities, he would definitely be a huge asset to the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Transcendent Douluo had an enormous advantage over a Titled Douluo when it came to survivability. Hence, Zhongli Wu had planned for the first battle to be a protracted one. Even if Huo Yuhao were able to use his Ultimate Ice to suppress the dark clouds, he would have to exhaust a lot of his soul power and techniques in order to triumph over Wu Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, little did he expect Wu Yun to perish in just a few short encounters. Even his soul had been destroyed. In fact, Wu Yun did not even have a chance to unleash his martial soul true body. He was simply killed while he was trying to probe Huo Yuhao to see what he had up his sleeves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has Huo Yuhao really become so powerful?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These thoughts fleeted in the minds of the powerful soul masters and soul engineers from both sides who were spectating the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they went through the entire battle in their heads again, they realized that Huo Yuhao did not make many moves. In fact, they did not even remember seeing him release the soul rings from his body. However, his extremely powerful Spiritual Shock left a deep impression on everyone. A Transcendent Douluo was somehow unable to block his Spiritual Shocks, and had died because of his spiritual attacks. How strong must Huo Yuhao be in order to have pulled this off?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who were capable of keener observations would have noticed the huge explosion which happened in the end. It seemed to be some sort of ability Huo Yuhao possessed. It was important to note that an eight-ringed Soul Douluo might not even be able to kill a Transcendent Douluo even if the Transcendent Douluo were to just stand there and allow the Soul Douluo to attack him for twenty-four hours straight. On top of that, Huo Yuhao did not even seem to be using any kind of soul skills. He was somehow able to kill Wu Yun with a gentle movement of his palms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Wu Yun did not possess a spirit, and hence could not effectively control his body, it did not change the fact that his body was still impossibly strong, and his soul power was still present within his body! What kind of ability would allow Huo Yuhao have to have to achieve that feat?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Yin Yang Complement soul cores! This was the answer which very few people actually knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao had planted his palm on Wu Yun’s body, he had transferred his Yin Yang Complement soul power into his body. The soul power he had transferred was an extremely unstable vortex. To put it simply, Huo Yuhao planted a mini soul core which drilled into Wu Yun’s body. And this soul core was controlled by Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The explosion of a soul core within Wu Yun's body was bound to kill him. Without his spirit to control his soul power to defend against the explosive force, he would never be able to survive no matter how strong his body was. It was important to note that Huo Yuhao’s soul core not only contained Ultimate Ice, but also his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Wu Yun’s already shattered spirit could never have survived the explosion formed from the powerful Yin Yang Complement soul power. His spirit was simply destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s heart started to beat faster as she started to grasp a better appreciation of Huo Yuhao’s power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder he was able to pursue my two beast-ranked soul engineer legions with such ease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t believe how strong he’s become. Yuhao, you really are a generational talent! You are definitely the right heir to inherit Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was amazed by the powers Huo Yuhao had exhibited. At the same time, she was becoming depressed. The more powerful Huo Yuhao became, the likelier he was to remain her enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi could still remember the words Huo Yuhao had said to her earlier. If he really wanted to continue harassing the Sun Moon Empire’s army, she would have no choice but to ask the Death God Douluo for help. And when that happened, it would definitely be a fight to the death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can the second fighter please step forward?” Just when everyone was staring at Huo Yuhao as though he was an actual War God, he suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, now that the first one was dead, it was time for the Sun Moon Empire to send out their second representative! The battle had only just begun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was visibly angered by Huo Yuhao’s words. After all, he had just lost an evil soul master who had just attained the Transcendent Douluo rank! It had taken him many years to develop and nurture a Transcendent Douluo, only for Huo Yuhao to take him down so easily. Wu Yun was an evil soul master who would rank in the top ten soul masters within the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yun’s death was completely futile! He did not even manage to showcase his abilities, and was instantly killed by Huo Yuhao when he was still trying to probe him. This was a result of him not being sufficiently familiar with Huo Yuhao as well as the explosive power of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power. He did not even manage to drain much of Huo Yuhao’s power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu turned around to look at Ju Zi before whispering, “Marshal, Huo Yuhao seems to possess extremely powerful spiritual power. We must borrow the power of spiritual defensive soul tools in order to deal with him. Hence, I need our Class 9 soul engineers to lend us a hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi immediately frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was able to keep his wits about him and find out where the problem lay even in such stressful situations. No wonder he was the Leader of the Holy Ghost Church!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was right! In the age of soul tools, it would be extremely difficult to beat Huo Yuhao without soul tools, especially when Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock was so powerful. However, once Zhongli Wu was able to equip his people with spiritual defensive soul tools, they should be able to withstand a few blows from Spiritual Shock. After all, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was limited. He would not be able to replicate his Spiritual Shock ten times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was definitely unable to turn Zhongli Wu’s request down when there were so many people, including evil soul masters from the Holy Ghost Church, around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She immediately turned around to look at the soul engineers behind her before asking, “Is any of you willing to lend your spiritual defensive soul tool to the military supervisor?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were about eleven Class 9 soul engineers behind Ju Zi, and all of them were top-class soul engineers within the Sun Moon Empire. More than half of the Class 9 soul engineers in the entire Sun Moon Empire were present here. However, after hearing Ju Zi’s words, all of them kept silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s eyes widened in rage. He was angry to find out that no one was willing to help him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was definitely not going to rush them. After all, the longer they took to send out the next person, the more soul power and spiritual power he could recover. Of course, Zhongli Wu knew this as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu gritted his teeth and exclaimed, “I will buy them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no time for him to lose. Considering how much he wanted the Jiangshi Ice Bear King, as well as how there was no room for failure after receiving the military order, he knew he had no choice but to buy the spiritual defensive soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After running its operations for so many years, the Holy Ghost Church possessed wealth which could rival the other empires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul engineers present were visibly attracted by the proposition of a purchase. After a short discussion, they produced a price list before Zhongli Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All eleven Class 9 soul engineers were like brothers from the same mother, as they produced the exact same price list as one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Class 9 spiritual defensive soul tool was definitely priceless. The Class 9 soul engineers would naturally only accept rare metals as the currency of the transaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They requested ten types of rare metals, and one tonne of each type of rare metal in exchange for a single Class 9 spiritual defensive soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu could feel his heart bleeding after seeing what the Class 9 soul engineers had quoted. Even though the Holy Ghost Church was incredibly rich, rare metals were commodities which had great strategic value!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Duskwater Alliance, which Huo Yuhao had previously joined, specialized in trading rare metals. Even though the Holy Ghost Church had the quantity of the rare metals they had quoted, it was still a substantive cost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But could Zhongli Wu say no? The value of a Titled Douluo evil soul master was definitely a lot more than whatever rare metals they were demanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I will make sure all of you pay for this!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu gritted his teeth and agreed to the prices offered by the Class 9 soul engineers, even though he knew they were simply trying to raid him when he was out of options.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He purchased a single spiritual defensive soul tool, because he had no idea how long Huo Yuhao could last against the next person he was about to send forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was trying to buy as few spiritual defensive soul tools as possible. If he needed them again, he would buy them later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Class 9 soul engineers appeared to be very calm and collected, they were all laughing deep down. It was a pleasant feeling to see how an evil soul master was forced to accept an unfair agreement. After all, soul engineers, like soul masters, were normal people. They would naturally not have a good impression of evil soul masters. On top of that, the relationship between the Holy Ghost Church and the soul engineers was becoming increasingly strained over the past few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu regretted not bringing some of the soul engineers from his Holy Ghost Church along for this war. He had left all of them behind in the Radiant City. If not, he would not have to agree to such an unfair deal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Zhongli Wu passed the spiritual defensive soul tool he had just bought to the person beside him. “Little Feng, take care. Please prioritize your safety.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” The person who was standing beside Zhongli Wu was the woman he loved. She was none other than Feng Ling, the Vice-Leader of the Holy Ghost Church!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was going to send Feng Ling as Huo Yuhao’s second opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right from the beginning, Zhongli Wu had never planned to use all ten battles. He did not believe that Huo Yuhao had the ability to last for ten battles, even though he must have something up his sleeves. At the same time, he did not want to use all of his trump cards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were more than ten powerful soul masters from the Holy Ghost Church who had followed the army to war. Every one of them was at least a Titled Douluo. Other than the two Ultimate Douluo, they pretty much formed the backbone of the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after their previous battle, as well as the fight against Di Tian, they had lost a couple of people. The battle against Di Tian had been exceptionally costly. Currently, they only had nine people left, and two of those nine people were heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, they could at best send out seven people. Among the seven people, only four of them—including Zhongli Wu himself—were at the level of a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was extremely difficult to cultivate to become a Transcendent Douluo as an evil soul master. It was even more difficult to nurture one. Usually, an evil soul master would have an enormous advantage over a normal soul master even if they were at the same rank. It was not impossible for one evil soul master to fight against multiple normal soul masters. However, when it came to higher-ranked battles, the advantage would gradually diminish.</span></p>
