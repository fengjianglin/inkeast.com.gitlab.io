<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was a Rank 94 Titled Douluo, known as the Fire Phoenix Douluo. It was a pity that her martial soul wasn’t a Fire Phoenix, but a Fire Phoenix Sword instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fire Phoenix Douluo was once a very notable name in the Sun Moon Empire. She was as reputable as the Starsky Douluo, Ye Yulin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ju Zi first took charge of the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion, this Fire Phoenix Douluo wasn’t very convinced. How could she possibly submit to such a young lady? However, Ju Zi was the Empress, and Xu Tianran even pleaded for her to continue to remain in the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. She would be treated the same, and was even given greater benefits. Apart from her title, she would continue to command the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. She was even told that Ju Zi was the commander in name only, and so she remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as time passed, Ju Zi led the legion to countless successes in the war. She commanded the entire army, and managed to overwhelm both the Star Luo and Heavenly Soul Empires. The Fire Phoenix Douluo was slowly convinced by her. She was now fully committed to aiding Ju Zi in managing this soul engineer legion. Apart from admiration for Ju Zi, she was even starting to like her now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi also called her ‘granny’ normally. For the unmarried Fire Phoenix Douluo, it was her desire to have such a granddaughter. She imparted everything she knew about soul tools to her, so she shared a very complicated relationship with Ju Zi. She was her subordinate, kin, and teacher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Ju Zi had been captured, she was very anxious, even though she looked very calm. She didn’t suspect Ju Zi at all. After all, they kept thinking that their target was a Titled Douluo before they had attacked. Furthermore, they believed that it was likely to be a Transcendent Douluo. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have set such a huge trap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Ju Zi had an Invincible Barrier on her body, it still had a limit. Against a true Transcendent Douluo, it couldn’t possibly completely resist a serious attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stay away. Otherwise, she’ll perish with me.” Huo Yuhao sounded very forceful. He intentionally changed his voice to sound hoarse and old. It was difficult to tell his age or even his gender from his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let go of her!” the Fire Phoenix Douluo screamed furiously before taking a step forward. A strong beam of fiery-red light subtly surfaced behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, even in the Sun Moon Empire, someone who could become a strong soul engineer would also naturally have a pretty strong martial soul. The Fire Phoenix Douluo was a good example of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed coldly. “If you want her to die, make a move. Otherwise, move away.” As he spoke, he pressed his hand harder on Ju Zi’s throat. It looked like he was gripping her throat tightly. Ju Zi played along with him and groaned in pain as she revealed a painful look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop it!” The Fire Phoenix Douluo was very anxious, almost unable to maintain her calm exterior. Her eyes flashed. She had gone to so much trouble to set up such a trap to capture Huo Yuhao, but it eventually led to her legion commander being taken as a hostage.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person is simply too strong. Not only can he conceal himself and imitate someone else’s appearance, but he also possesses great ice-type abilities. Don’t tell me he has twin martial souls? Or does he have a strong soul tool with him?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fire Phoenix Douluo couldn’t tell right now, but she clearly knew that she couldn’t let him go. If she wanted to capture him again, it would be extremely difficult. However, if she didn’t let him go, Ju Zi would be in danger. Ju Zi wasn’t only the marshal of three armies; she was also the Empress! If her safety was endangered, no one could possibly handle the responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t care about what the Fire Phoenix Douluo thought. He strangled Ju Zi as he slowly moved forward. He wasn’t very quick, but his spiritual power started to spread quickly. When he only had two rings, he was able to scare a bunch of soul beasts by imitating the aura of the Ice Empress. After all these years, his abilities in imitation were unparalleled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He seemed to have assimilated with his surroundings as he unleashed a terrifying soul beast aura. The pressing aura that belonged to a hundred-thousand-year soul beast immediately caused all the seven-ringed soul engineers to pale. Some of them almost fired the soul tools in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took one step at a time as he walked towards the Fire Phoenix Douluo. Ju Zi was completely in his arms. No one would doubt that a Titled Douluo had countless ways to kill a person. The Fire Phoenix Douluo gritted her teeth and roared, “Stand back! Let him leave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pathway was slowly opened. The Fire Phoenix Douluo asked, “What will make you let go of our legion commander?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although everyone from the legion had already made way, their linked defensive barrier hadn’t moved yet. The Fire Phoenix Douluo was very experienced. She instructed everyone to make way to reduce Huo Yuhao’s killing intent, so that she would be able to negotiate with him afterward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao calmly said, “You don’t have the right to negotiate with me. After I leave, I’ll definitely let go of her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fire Phoenix Douluo didn’t budge. “Swear on your martial soul before I’ll believe you. Otherwise, I’d rather perish together if you hurt our legion commander after leaving.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao snorted coldly and said, “Alright, I swear on my martial soul that I’ll let go of this hostage after I leave. Otherwise, my martial soul will be crushed, and never be restored. Is this fine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How would he ever hurt Ju Zi? The Fire Phoenix Douluo had suggested that he should swear, and so he went along with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that he agreed so readily, the Fire Phoenix Douluo furrowed her brow. After hesitating for a brief moment, she eventually gestured and instructed her subordinates to remove their linked defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao slowly left with Ju Zi. He still remained very wary at this moment. There were so many soul engineers here. Perhaps the enemy had some kind of special soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He unleashed his Spiritual Interference Domain and both his and Ju Zi’s figures blurred. All the soul tools lost their locks on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s skin was as smooth as ever. Even though he was only touching her neck now, he could still feel how soft and smooth it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi didn’t make any noise apart from the earlier groan. To those from the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion, she had been completely suppressed, and wasn’t able to speak at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Huo Yuhao broke free from the encirclement. He turned around and faced the Fire Phoenix Douluo, who was following him. He slowly stepped back. Under the effect of his Imitation, he slowly melted into the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are also very strong. I hope you stay true to your words. Otherwise, your vow will turn into a curse!” the Fire Phoenix Douluo swore coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a Titled Douluo like her, she fully believed in destiny. A vow couldn’t be made easily, especially one that was on one’s martial soul. A vow was usually the most serious and official form of transaction between many Titled Douluo when they negotiated with one another. With Huo Yuhao’s vow, she believed that he wouldn’t dare to renege on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Never would she have guessed that Huo Yuhao wasn’t a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief after melting into the darkness. Although they were stuck in ice and snow, the back of his shirt was completely drenched with sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was simply too dangerous. If the legion commander of the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion hadn’t been Ju Zi, he wasn’t sure if he could have even made it out alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could clearly see that Ju Zi was ready to unleash her second Invincible Barrier. Under that circumstance, he could only attack with all his might. He had to either stop her from unleashing her Invincible Barrier, or crush the Invincible Barrier and take her as a hostage before his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for whether he would succeed, Huo Yuhao didn’t have any confidence at all. Today’s situation wasn’t any less dangerous than the time when he was surrounded by two evil soul masters and the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion in Sunrise City. Wang Qiu’er was the one who had saved him then. This time, it was Ju Zi. Fortunately, Ju Zi’s life wouldn’t be in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He subconsciously let go of Ju Zi’s neck. He only held her waist as he fled far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi didn’t utter a sound at all. She let Huo Yuhao bring her wherever he wanted. Right now, how could she not be emotional?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only after flying tens of kilometers away and using his Spiritual Detection to scan his surroundings to ensure no one was following them that Huo Yuhao landed. He found a place to stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, Ju Zi.” Huo Yuhao let go of his arms around Ju Zi’s waist and gently sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi turned around suddenly and embraced him. He was completely in her grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in a daze. The surrounding winds were very chilly. He had unleashed his soul power to protect himself and Ju Zi. He wasn’t afraid of the cold, but she was! At this moment, he had already forgotten that Ju Zi was a Soul Sage.</span></p>
