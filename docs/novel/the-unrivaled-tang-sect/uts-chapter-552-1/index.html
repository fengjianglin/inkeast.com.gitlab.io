 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Class 9 soul engineer, who thought he had just managed to escape from the jaws of death, was consumed by the intense purple-gold light before he could even let out a scream. The few remaining defensive methods he had did not even stand a chance against this streak of purple-gold light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Huo Yuhao’s plan be complete without Tang Wutong’s involvement? The Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun was the final blow!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The combined efforts of everyone helped slay a Class 9 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After realizing he had attacked the wrong person, the Starsky Douluo revealed an expression of grief and regret. His expression worsened when he saw how his companion perished under the Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun. His eyes revealed a hint of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And right now, the soul tool installation he had feared was about to be attacked did not seem to be under any form of threat from the enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Yulin immediately understood that they had been duped. The guiding flare was real, but the dark figure that followed after it was not any powerful offensive soul tool. It was a misjudgement he had made under the pressure of his circumstances. And because of his error, the soul tool front was not able to provide support fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when Ye Yulin wanted to contact them again, a huge pressure started to act on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dark blue entity was heading towards him after forming an elegant parabolic flight path in the night sky. The speed at which the person was moving could only be achieved with the help of a Class 9 flying soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Yulin could no longer afford to ponder how his enemies were able to secure the help of such a powerful Class 9 soul engineer. He immediately turned and escaped without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After releasing the Sunmoon Divine Needle twice in a row, he had expended a considerable amount of his soul power. On top of that, he had already witnessed the death of his companion with his own eyes. There were a total of five soul masters circling around him. Even though he was very egotistical, he was not foolish enough to think that he would be able to go up against five powerful opponents at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he chose to flee without hesitating. After all, he also possessed a Class 9 flying soul tool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, streaks of light exploded in the distant sky. Following which, there seemed to be a mysterious wave which rippled through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bastard!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Yulin was enraged to see those streaks of light. Of course he knew what those things were. Those soul cannon shells were not destructive. They were called interference shells. After exploding, they were able to release powerful interference waves which could temporarily disable all communication and surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s objective was apparent, because there were no surveillance soul tools near them. He was trying to cut off all communication between Ye Yulin and the other troops of the Sun Moon Empire. In fact, he had just been about to signal the soul tool front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Yulin seemed to become increasingly frustrated with how events were unfolding. In fact, there was also a growing sense of fear in his heart. His enemy was somehow able to predict every single action he was about to make. Huo Yuhao always seemed to be one move ahead of him. Hence, he was not ready to become complacent. There was no point in trying to delay these enemies anymore. It was of the utmost importance for him to escape and save his own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, the Class 9 soul engineer who was facing Bei Bei and the rest was also in a dangerous predicament. He made a few feints before releasing a series of powerful attacks to force them back. Following which, he also released his Class 9 flying soul tool and tried to flee. Of course, the path he chose to take fell within the effective radius of the interference shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and the others pretended to chase after them for a short while before quickly returning to the protective soul barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After their short battle with the soul engineers, most of the heavy artillery had already retreated into the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this short amount of time, one of the soul engineers had fallen, while the other two had fled. It was truly an exciting battle for the higher-ups of Tang Sect. Meanwhile, Huo Yuhao immediately focused his spiritual power to maintain the spectral gate, which had started to fade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, the gate had been kept opened by Li Ya. Fortunately, Huo Yuhao returned just when she was about to run out of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After successfully exiting the area that the interference waves affected, the soul engineers immediately contacted the soul tool front. The soul tools began to charge their long-range weapons with energy as they aimed at the linked defensive barrier where Huo Yuhao and the rest were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, all of them were racing against time. There were more figures emerging from the Sun Moon Empire’s Palace as they raced towards Huo Yuhao’s position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao had expected, they were lucky that the Sun Moon Empire’s Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was not around. If not, they would definitely not be able to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, a blinding white pillar of light surged into the sky from Radiant City! Its powerful glare instantly illuminated half of the entire city. The people who were closer to the white light felt as though day and night had been reversed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as his surroundings were illuminated by the white light, the faces of Huo Yuhao and his peers who had yet to retreat also became white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was instantly alerted by this powerful beam. Even though they were almost done with retreating, the Fort Soul Engineer Legion and the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion were still not done yet. They needed a little more time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they didn’t know exactly how powerful the white light was because of how far away it was, Huo Yuhao knew that the white light was definitely released by whichever soul legion was defending Radiant City. They must have revved up their linked offensive soul tools in order to generate so much power. Even if it was done without the support of the high-energy compression array soul tools, its power was still not to be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire sky—along with its clouds—had turned white. Even though the white pillar at Radiant City had disappeared, the white color in the sky was becoming increasingly intense with every moment that passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao focused his gaze on the sky. There was a gigantic white ball of light, which was at least a hundred meters wide, high up in the sky. It was following an incredible parabolic path as it headed for him and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit!” Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection had been feeding his peers with his observations. Hence, his companions were all able to see what he had seen. Xu Sanshi immediately lowered his body without any hesitation as he prepared to launch himself into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the strongest defense-type soul master among Shrek’s Seven Monsters, Xu Sanshi knew he had to be the one to block the ball. This was especially true because he possessed both the Xuanwu Shield and the Golden Tortoise spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan became incredibly tense as she prepared to soar into the air with him. She knew it was impossible to hold him back in such moments. Hence, she decided to join him instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hold up.” Huo Yuhao flickered to their backs as he placed his hands on their arms to stop them from flying up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao!” Xu Sanshi growled angrily at Huo Yuhao. In his eyes, this was not the time to hesitate. If they delayed their response, the entire team could be wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There seems to be a problem with its aim!” Huo Yuhao shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the gigantic white ball was already descending from the sky. There was a trail of white smoke behind it as it raced towards the group. Even though it was not moving very quickly, it exerted a frightening amount of pressure on everyone—including those who were under the linked defensive barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It only took a few seconds before the ball fully descended from the sky and landed heavily at a place roughly two hundred meters away from their linked defensive barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground initially trembled lightly before the vibration’s amplitude increased tremendously. Their vision started to blur as the ground beneath them appeared to melt under the constant shockwaves rippling through the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white shockwaves collided with the linked defensive barrier in an extremely violent fashion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beep! Beep! Beep!” A deafening alarm started to ring. The linked defensive barrier was showing signs of crumbling under the immense pressure from the shockwaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the Fort Soul Engineer Legion was almost done with their retreat. Only the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion and Shrek’s Seven Monsters were still waiting in the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, listen to my orders! Get ready to launch our linked offensive soul tools! As for the rest of you, retreat! Eldest senior brother, leave with the rest of them.” Huo Yuhao’s voice echoed in everyone’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei growled, “No way. I’m the one in charge of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion. You’re the one who needs to leave first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately turned around to look at Bei Bei before speaking with a serious tone. “Eldest senior brother, I will stay behind with Dong’er to lead the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion. Please trust me. I would never put my loved one’s lives in danger. There will only be hope for us to bring the entire Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion to safety if I stay behind. Trust me! The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion is not in Radiant City right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having shared an intimate relationship all these years, Bei Bei was definitely able to understand what Huo Yuhao was hinting at. He looked at Huo Yuhao before saying, “We will wait for you then. Everyone, I need you to retreat with me.” Following which, he waved his hand at his junior brothers and sisters as they charged through the spectral gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, another streak of powerful white light was launched from Radiant City into the air. Once again, the blinding white light illuminated the city as the frightening power reappeared within the linked defensive barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that the linked defensive barrier would definitely be unable to withstand another blow.
