 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hid behind a small hill. The weather was cold, but that didn’t affect him at all. However, he couldn’t help but swallow as he stared at the smoke spiraling from the army camp in the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drinking some hot soup in such snowy lands would be so luxurious! I’m just doing hard labor now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t help but laugh bitterly as his thoughts stopped there. However, he could only continue, since he was already at this stage. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laid out his map as he leaned against the hill. He had prepared this map long ago. It wasn’t a map of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s northern region, but a detailed map of the Douluo Continent’s northern regions. He had spent quite a lot of money to get this map. The map itself was made from goatskin, both tough and soft at the same time. It could be preserved for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao scrutinized the map for a while when he discovered that the Sun Moon Empire’s army was still going northeast. They would reach the border between the Heavenly Soul Empire and the Dou Ling Empire if they went further in the same direction. They would also be bordering the Extreme North there, and it would be even colder than it was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature there was no small problem for typical soul masters, but could normal soldiers really bear it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around as he contemplated, and laid on his stomach on the hill as he gazed at the Sun Moon Empire’s camp in the distance. He activated Spiritual Detection and swept it toward the army camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He quickly discovered that something else was happening. The Sun Moon Empire’s camp seemed to be handing something out, and their soldiers were all lined up to collect those things Everybody was issued two items that resembled small boxes, and cotton-padded clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cotton-padded clothes seemed decent in quality. That was especially true for the cotton shoes. They were thick and sturdy, and Huo Yuhao could tell that they would be very good at retaining warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like the Sun Moon Empire has long been prepared! These soldiers are probably decent at resisting the cold, so the Sun Moon Empire can’t have deployed soldiers from their own northern territories. Since that’s the case, and in addition to the cotton clothes that they have prepared, they will actually be able to resist the severe cold for a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao went through the night amid the chilly winds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood during what those boxes that were given out to the soldiers did the next morning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every box was about the size of a palm, and the soldiers placed them in their clothes. These boxes were very closely pressed against their inner shirts and tied around their waists. When they began to march, Huo Yuhao immediately realized that the boxes emanated gentle heat. The heat coursed throughout the soldiers’ bodies and helped them resist the external cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That works?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those tiny boxes should also be soul tools. If that was the case, the box definitely needed sealed Milk Bottles inside. Maintaining the heat didn’t need too much soul power, but Huo Yuhao could tell from the size of the box that it could only be sustained for a few days before it had to be charged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought carefully for a moment, and couldn’t help but concede his enemies’ ingenuity. The Sun Moon Empire’s army was following a formidable soul engineer legion, and the Fire Phoenix Legion had at least three hundred soul engineers. Charging those small milk bottles didn’t need too much of their soul power. When the army was resting at night, every soul master would be responsible for some soldiers’ sealed Milk Bottles. Naturally, they would be able to charge all those milk bottles that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hadn’t expected the Sun Moon Empire to have developed soul tools for commoners to use. If, one day, they could find something to substitute for milk bottles, the Sun Moon Empire could truly conquer the entire continent. That would be the time when normal soldiers could become soul engineers, and they would have a soul engineer’s attacking power. Huo Yuhao thought about it. How frightening would it be if a hundred thousand soul engineers appeared on the battlefield?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a faint sigh inside. He shook his head as he accepted this reality in exasperation. It seemed like the Douluo Continent’s three native empires had to accomplish great feats as soon as possible if they wished to fight back against the Sun Moon Empire. Otherwise, within a hundred years, even if the Sun Moon Empire didn’t launch an invasion, their technological advantage would become increasingly evident. The Douluo Continent would belong to them like a meal on a lunch plate…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was lamenting inside, but he had to continue following them. He was still following far behind them on their flank, and he trailed the army towards the Heavenly Soul Empire’s northeastern region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s great army slowed down as the weather became colder. The place that Huo Yuhao had estimated they would reach within a day took them two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was white and snowy around him, and the cold winds howled through the air as they cut like blades. There wasn’t much moisture in the air in a snowy place like this, because any bit of water would be immediately frozen. The temperature here was at least thirty degrees below zero, and normal people would find it extremely difficult to survive in such an environment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was almost evening before the Sun Moon Empire set up camp once more. Their camp was a lot more compact than before. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao realized to his surprise that the layout was also different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fire Phoenix Legion, who were originally in the innermost sections, were shifted to the periphery. They formed an arch as they directly faced the northwestern winds, as if they were alpha wolves guarding their companions from the most bitter chill. The commander’s tent was apparently right at the front, and it didn’t move at all even when the cold wind blew against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other tents were tightly and neatly arranged in rows behind them. This was the layout that could preserve as much heat as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiraling smoke had disappeared by now, and he could see hot air rising from some large tents. There was no doubt that the army cooks were located toward the center, and not on the outside. Otherwise, starting a fire would be very difficult in a place like this, where water turned into ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved another faint sigh in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I have been freezing for a day, and I should also get a sip of that hot soup! Even though I’m not afraid of the cold, I have been exposed to the weather in this snowy place for days. These days haven’t really been comfortable at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao could tell that the Sun Moon Empire’s army wasn’t that far away from their destination. They were always travelling toward the northwest, and now, they were near the Extreme North’s borders. They would enter the Extreme North if they continued forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had been in the Extreme North before, and was very clear on the dreadful conditions there. Normal people would definitely not survive in a place like that, and that was the case even with cotton-padded clothes and soul tools that provided heat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even soul masters couldn’t go deep inside if they didn’t meet a certain standard. Furthermore, there were many ice-type soul beasts living in the Extreme North. They borrowed strength from their surroundings, and were much more powerful than typical soul beasts. The Fire Phoenix Legion would run out of strength no matter how powerful they were if they ran into a pack of formidable soul beasts. Huo Yuhao could faintly guess that the reason why the Fire Phoenix Legion was involved in this operation was likely to be because their abilities had something to do with fire. Fire-type abilities would be greatly limited in a place like this, but fire-type abilities were also good at resisting the cold. The more he thought about it, the more Huo Yuhao felt that the Fire Phoenix Legion wasn’t directing the Sun Moon Empire’s army here to fight. They were here for something else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued to think as a faint light flickered. He hid himself within a small depression in a mountain. He didn’t have any fire-type abilities, and having something warm in such a snowy place was completely impossible. However, he had his own methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He retrieved some dry rations from his storage-type soul tool before he placed them on his right hand. A strange scene occurred; the tough dry rations in his hand gradually softened, before they began to emanate a faint warmth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hadn’t wasted his time in the Extreme North over the past few days. His understanding of the element of ice had become increasingly deep, especially in terms of controlling heat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice needed a lot of heat to melt. In the same way, water forming ice would release large amounts of heat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao leveraged this principle as he sealed off the air around him before he began to control his blood and condense it into ice. This naturally released heat; such control shouldn’t be too difficult for a person with spiritual power as powerful as his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the dry rations would only be a little warm and soft. He had to eat them quickly. In the end, he couldn’t let the blood in his hands freeze for too long, just long enough to swallow those dry rations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao swiftly dealt with dinner as he prepared to meditate once more. However, right at that moment, he suddenly realized that something was happening in the Sun Moon Empire’s army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire began to erect thick metal pillars around their camp in the dark of night. Some of the Fire Phoenix Legion’s members clad in dark-red armor were hard at work, flying through the air as they arranged those metal pillars according to their designated locations, before certain individuals would hammer them into the ground and stabilize them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normal people would need many large machines to complete a task like this. However, this wasn’t much for soul engineers. Soul engineers were soul masters first, and they could rely on auxiliary soul tools for aid, so they found such tasks very easy and casual. It didn’t take long before they were almost done with their job.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Have they arrived at their destination?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao observed closely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no doubt that these metal pillars were brought along with their storage-type soul tools. Every pillar seemed about fifty meters long, and were more than three meters in diameter. It wasn’t hard to imagine their weight. They were not just brought by storage-type soul tools; this had to be done with high-quality storage-type soul tools!</span></p>
