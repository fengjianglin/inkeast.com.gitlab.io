It was an indescribable sense of harmony. It was as if this wasn’t a soul tool at all, but a piece of metal. Its texture felt very similar to that of solid metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every part of the Milk Bottle gave him the same feeling. The weight and everything else felt like that. This feeling was too miraculous. He Caitou’s Milk Bottle was much less balanced compared to Huo Yuhao’s Milk Bottle, even it was roughly similar to Huo Yuhao’s Milk Bottle in terms of appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little… second brother, your Class 3 Milk Bottle isn’t a Class 4 soul tool. It’s better than a Class 4 soul tool!” He Caitou couldn’t help but rave over Huo Yuhao’s Milk Bottle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled and replied, “I felt very good just now. It seems like the tense atmosphere of this tournament helps me to focus better.” There were outsiders around, and thus he naturally couldn’t say that it was his first time testing out the spiritual power obtained from his concrete-immaterial realm by fusing it into the entire production process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou gestured and called for the referees behind them. He passed his and Huo Yuhao’s Milk Bottles to the referees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two referees held their Milk Bottles separately and said, “I’ll need the two of you to wait. We’ll need the chief referee to test your Milk Bottles out. When he’s done, we’ll verify the results.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao signaled for them to leave. He and He Caitou looked at each other and revealed light smiles of confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, Huo Yuhao felt that He Caitou’s eyes were very bright today. It might be because such a soul engineering tournament was what he was truly interested in. Huo Yuhao could even sense the excitement coming from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Chen An walked over. He was holding the Milk Bottles that Huo Yuhao and He Caitou had made. He was completely astonished at this moment. He arrived in front of Huo Yuhao and asked softly, “Is this your work?” He handed the Milk Bottle that Huo Yuhao had made back over to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao received his Milk Bottle and nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An took in a deep breath, and his eyes were filled with respect. “It’s perfect.” His admiration came from the bottom of his heart. He hadn’t respected Huo Yuhao the first time he had demonstrated his evil soul powers, he had only feared him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and asked, “Have we passed, then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course.” Chen An answered without any hesitation. “After seeing your work today, I’m more and more confident that you’ll be able to compete on behalf of the Duskwater Alliance. However, I won’t submit your Milk Bottle. This is a secret of the Illustrious Virtue Hall. Surely you didn’t install a self-destruction component, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao proudly said, “If I added such a component, it wouldn’t be perfect, am I right? I’ll give it to you. If you get into trouble because of this in the future, you’ll have to handle the responsibility.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are giving it to me?” Chen An was shocked. Even though he knew it was a Class 3 Milk Bottle, he had tested it out, and knew that a Class 4 Milk Bottle was unable to handle the amount of soul power that it could contain! It was able to work like a Class 4 Milk Bottle with the structure of a Class 3 Milk Bottle. It was magical! He was even more shocked by the sealed-in system that the Milk Bottle contained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Huo Yuhao had created a Sealed Milk Bottle. It was precisely because of this that he had had to complete two more sealed formation arrays compared to He Caitou. They even had to be separated by an exact distance. They were installed into the Milk Bottle using his acute senses, allowing the Milk Bottle to be completely sealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although such a Milk Bottle was expensive, it wasn’t the reason why Chen An was shocked. He was shocked by Huo Yuhao’s technique! Huo Yuhao didn’t mark the Milk Bottle or install any self-destruction components. This also meant that he could dismantle this Milk Bottle to research how Huo Yuhao had managed to create it. To him, this was something that couldn’t be bought with money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Give us the verification that proves we’ve advanced to the next round. We are returning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An took in a deep breath. Apart from the admiration in his eyes, there were other emotions as he looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t thank you enough for your generosity. Don’t worry, I’ll do anything you want me to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao waved his hand and said, “Can you get as many rare metals as you can for me? I’m willing to buy them. You should know how soul engineers like us need rare metals. Without sufficient quantities of them, we’ll be unable to carry out some experiments. It isn’t convenient for us to move around outside either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, yes! I’ll help you gather all types of rare metals!” Chen An answered without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lifted his hand and swept the remaining rare metals on the carving table into his Starlight Sapphire storage-type ring. After obtaining the verification from Chen An, He Caitou pushed Yuhao’s wheelchair as they left the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou didn’t stand on ceremony either. He also put the remaining rare metals on the table into his storage-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before leaving the hall, Huo Yuhao also passed on some instructions to Chen An. He only returned to meet Wang Dong’er and Na Na after doing so, before they left the Green Hotel and returned to the Ming Yue Hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little junior, can we trust that person?” He Caitou whispered to Huo Yuhao as they were about to reach the Ming Yue Hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and answered, “There shouldn’t be any problems in the short-term. In his heart, he believes that I’m an important figure in the Holy Ghost Church. I’ve also given him a lot of benefits. He won’t do anything harmful to us before those benefits disappear. By helping us, he’ll also stand to gain tremendously, I’ve already proven that to him today. If you were him, what would you do? I believe Chen An is a clever person. Clever people will do clever things. Furthermore, if we take a step back and assume he reports us to the Duskwater Alliance, I’ll discover it once danger arises. It’ll be convenient for us to escape any problems. There won’t be any major obstacles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body stiffened as he finished speaking. His expression also changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s gaze was fixed on him. Seeing that his body had stiffened up so suddenly, she hurriedly asked, “Yuhao, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “I just received a premonition. I suddenly felt very surprised, as if something important was going to happen. Furthermore, it’s something that’s not good for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er, He Caitou and Na Na became more alert. They slowed down, and Huo Yuhao also unleashed his Spiritual Detection as he surveyed their surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t discover anything, and everything seemed very normal. However, the sensation didn’t seem to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t discover anything even when they reached their room in the hotel. They weren’t subjected to any ambushes, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou couldn’t help but ask, “Yuhao, are you being too sensitive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head lightly and replied, “That feeling was very sudden. I don’t know what’s going on, either. However, my premonitions are very accurate, considering my spiritual power. Everyone, please rest early. Be careful tonight. If there are any changes, we must inform one another according to our arrangement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” He Caitou and Na Na acknowledged his words before returning to their rooms to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

The sensation that Huo Yuhao felt also slowly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He washed his face and ate his breakfast. Even he was doubtful at this point, and muttered to himself, “Was I really being too sensitive last night? I don’t feel so suppressed anymore. However, I feel like I’ve forgotten something.”</span></p>

After all, it wasn’t a good thing, either. I wonder who we’ll be facing in the round-robin stage. It’s the lot-drawing ceremony today. Sister Nannan and third senior have gone for it. I’m sure she won’t let third senior draw the lot this time. Haha!”</span></p>

In addition, Shrek’s official team is also in the same group as us. The tournament’s organizing committee must have rigged this. We are even meeting Team Sun Moon in the first fight.
