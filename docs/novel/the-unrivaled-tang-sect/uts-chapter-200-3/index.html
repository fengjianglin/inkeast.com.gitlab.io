 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

If this were a dry and humid place, his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice’s strength would’ve been greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Huo Yuhao was akin to one of the thousands of snowflakes in his domain–he’d completely assimilated himself into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya.” The Snow Lady’s voice echoed in Huo Yuhao’s head. She’d asked for him to act according to her instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Snow Empress was newly-created, her presence seemed to be similar to a martial soul fusion, which he was experienced at doing with Wang Dong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao opened his mind and followed her will; he wanted to see what abilities she’d show him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Snow Lady moved, his body moved alongside hers. Huo Yuhao immediately felt his body become lighter and felt himself drift into the air like a snowflake. His movements also complemented the dancing snowflakes that filled the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gradually felt like he was becoming one with heaven in this snowy-white world. A moment later, he also began to feel a strange force gathering in his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This force didn’t originate from his body, but rather from the chill in the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s hands would become very smooth and shiny when he used the Mysterious Jade Hands, while his palm would be covered in a layer of diamond-like ice crystals when he used the Ice Empress’ Pincer. At this moment, both the Mysterious Jade Hands and the Ice Empress’ Pincer had been activated. However, they were present in a special form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was Huo Yuhao’s left hand as smooth and shiny as jade, but it was also as white as snow. It was as if it had been carved from a precious piece of white jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan remained &nbsp;where he was while using his soul power to resist the extreme cold attempting to invade his body. As he spread his senses, he tried to figure out where Huo Yuhao was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he’d only admired Huo Yuhao before, then he was completely astonished now. His spiritual sense could be ranked amongst the top ten on the continent, yet he couldn’t even catch a glimpse of Huo Yuhao in this domain. It was as if he’d completely assimilated himself into this world of ice and snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The delicate snowflakes in the air continued to incessantly unleash strong attacks. Amidst the cold, they created sparks as they flitted past Tai Tan; they were evidently very powerful</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian was equally shocked. He’d been brothers with Tai Tan for many years, and had previously been standing very close to him. Even though he couldn’t tell where Tai Tan was in the domain, he knew for sure that Tai Tan hadn’t moved. He took a few steps until he was beside Tai Tan. Only then could he make out the vague silhouette of his brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the raging snowstorm stopped in an indescribable manner. The instant that it did, it was as if time and space had frozen. Every single snowflake froze in midair, while the chilly wind immediately came to a halt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This happened so abruptly that both Niu Tian and Tai Tan were momentarily shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any warning, the snowflakes were crushed, and their power disappeared, the powdery ice in the sky blurring their vision once again. The chill in the snowflakes seemed to have disappeared too, and the air suddenly felt much warmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Be careful, this is the Gentleness Amidst Warmth, Snowless Glacier!” Niu Tian suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan was petrified. Something serious must have been happened since Niu Tian had warned him. After all, he had acute senses too. When his sense of crisis appeared, he lifted his right arm and to move it through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, he felt his right arm rapidly cooling &nbsp;down. He groaned and then swept it in front of him yet again. As his vision cleared up, he saw Huo Yuhao’s body being pushed aside. The moment that he did, he lost all feeling in his right arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The extreme chill seemed to have caused the temperature in Tai Tan’s arm to hit absolute zero. Even with his cultivation and by activating all of his soul power was he able to slowly defrost his frozen arm. It wasn’t just his blood that had been frozen; the soul and spiritual power in his arm had also solidified. It was as if his entire arm had ceased to exist. His shoulder seemed to be joined to a block of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao appeared twenty meters away. When he did, he seemed to magically squeeze his way out of a snowflake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An orangish-gold light drifted behind him, followed by a strange scene: The orangish-gold light on the Snow Lady’s body began to brighten, and her body instantly elongated. In a matter of moments, she’d turned into a young lady who appeared to be around sixteen or seventeen years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyes were still deep-blue, but her ravishing beauty reminded one of the Snow Empress. Although she still looked somewhat innocent, the sense of elegance that belonged to the Icesky Snow Lady was present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything happened nearly instantly. When Tai Tan saw Huo Yuhao and the transformed Snow Lady, Huo Yuhao had already lifted his right hand high into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The now-older Snow Empress also lifted her right arm. Her figure seemed to fuse with Huo Yuhao’s, and a deep blue sword that seemed to be entirely made up of ice crystals appeared in Huo Yuhao’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Niu Tian and Tai Tan could take a clear look at the sword, Huo Yuhao had already swung it. A deep blue light appeared and created a fan-like projection that gradually grew lighter as it extended until it was finally white. As the frightening sword light swept through the air, turtle-like patterns appeared. It was as if the air was frozen and then cut apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unparalleled Chill, Empress Sword!” Niu Tian said almost immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady detached from Huo Yuhao’s body as soon as he swung the sword. She then pointed her left hand at Tai Tan, while Huo Yuhao subconsciously lifted his left hand. However, he realized that something was amiss and immediately exclaimed, “Snow Lady, we can’t do that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady hesitated for a moment, then turned back to face him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bam!” A loud boom came from Tai Tan’s direction, who’d lifted his left arm to try and resist the now-white sword light. Huo Yuhao’s sword had also disappeared once he’d created the sword light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan’s body expanded to twice its size as he readied himself, and black hair that shone with a metallic glow engulfed his body. His burly body was immediately filled with a terrifying yet dominant aura, while his right arm began to defrost at an astonishing speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was still turned into an ice sculpture the moment that the deep blue sword light struck him, despite the fact that he’d unleashed his martial soul. He took a full second break free from the ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This second was incredibly important—this was the second after Tai Tan had unleashed his martial soul! As a Transcendent Douluo, his abilities were obviously immense. However, he’d been stopped by Huo Yuhao and the Snow Empress’ Spirit for an entire second!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impressive!” Tai Tan didn’t attack Huo Yuhao. At the moment, he didn’t have any intention of attacking him. Rather, he was completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady shrunk down and returned to her infant state as she returned to Huo Yuhao’s side; she was evidently fatigued. She appeared to be unhappy as she looked at Huo Yuhao, and even used her hand to mess up his hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Tai isn’t an enemy!” Huo Yuhao said seriously, “How could we hurt him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan almost spat blood when he heard him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s going on? Hurt me? Am I the Titled Douluo, or is he the Titled Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan was unhappy and shouted, “Rascal, show me what else you’ve got!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Use what? You’ve already lost.” Niu Tian kicked Tai Tan’s butt, causing him to reel.</span></p>

His face turned red. “It was subconscious, it was subconscious!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian snapped, “Do you always have to be a sore loser? If you lost, you lost. There’s no need to make up excuses. Furthermore, your loss was justified. Soul skills must have been unleashed repeatedly when the Snow Lady pointed at you. That strike could have even hurt you. You must have also released your martial soul because you felt a sense of crisis. Am I right? Otherwise, what subconscious feeling are you talking about?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian looked at Huo Yuhao, “How did you do it? How do you feel? Is there anything that you haven’t used? If I’m not wrong, the two of you have only used three soul skills. There should still be one left.” The Snow Lady had added four soul rings to Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head. “For some unknown reason, the Snow Lady can’t unleash her fourth soul skill. She can’t tell what’s going on either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian gestured towards him, and he immediately walked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking a deep look at Huo Yuhao, Niu Tian said from the bottom of his heart, “I’ve got to say that you’re definitely capable of surviving on your own now. The Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques are impressive! I didn’t expect that the Three Ultimate Techniques, which made the Snow Empress famous, would be transferred to your body through this Spirit. Even though they’ve been divided into four soul rings, any soul skill formed from the essence of the Snow Empress’ seven hundred thousand year cultivation is bound to be vastly superior to that of an ordinary ten thousand year soul skill. Moreover, she perfectly complements your abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques?” Huo Yuhao was stunned as he looked at Niu Tian. He’d heard the names of every soul skill he unleashed when Niu Tian shouted them previously. He didn’t know what they were, thus wanted to use this time to find out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh. It seems that Shrek Academy didn’t fully explain the situation regarding the Ten Great Savage Beasts.” Niu Tian replied.</span></p>
