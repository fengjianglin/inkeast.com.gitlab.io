 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our relationship got better and better, and we became very good friends. That was until one day, when we bumped into Ye Xishui again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ye Xishui was really beautiful when she was younger. Lass, she wasn’t worse compared to you.” As he said that, there seemed to be a captivated look in Long Xiaoyao’s eyes, even though he was already very old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She was both bubbly and cute then. Very soon, the three of us became very good friends who toured the continent together. Xishui had a very good personality. We were both young men too. Very soon, it became apparent that we liked her. Both of us discussed this matter privately. Since we both liked her, we’d rely on our capabilities to win her heart. I was more confident than your teacher. After all, I was much better in the looks department. My powers weren’t inferior to him either. I had the confidence of winning Xishui’s heart. I even told him that the other party must accept her choice no matter what, and that we’ll remain good friends no matter the outcome. Mu En agreed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To prevent jealousy from ruining our relationship, Mu En and I decided to both find Xishui one day and confess. We hoped that she would make a choice. It was better for us to confess than hide our feelings. Xishui seemed to have been scared by us. She hesitated for half a day before she made her choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bitter look appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was helpless as he gently shook his head. “I didn’t expect that I would be the one to be rejected. Xishui chose Mu En. Even up until now, I can still remember how delighted Mu En was. It was something he couldn’t hide. He leaped over and hugged her. He even spun three rounds with her in his embrace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even though we agreed to be good friends, I was still devastated then. I left without turning back. When Mu En came to chase after me, I ran with all my strength. He didn’t chase after me because he had to take care of Xishui.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but ask, “Elder Long, wait a minute. Why did I learn that Xishui didn’t choose either of you? Instead, she wanted both of you to fight a year later. The winner would get her! But neither of you went...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao snorted, “You must have heard that from Little Xuan. He only heard it second-hand. While it’s true that we did fight later, Xishui was already with him then. It’s just that they kept it a secret.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After sighing, Long Xiaoyao said, “I’m actually a very proud person. I’ve known this for a long time. That was the heaviest blow that I’d suffered in my entire life. I walked the streets feeling very lost. Unknowingly, I walked out of the city and entered the wilderness. I was alone, and I didn’t even know how long I walked. My heart was completely broken. The pain of being jilted was excruciating. I hated Mu En then. I even hated Xishui. I didn’t understand why she would choose him. I was confident that I was more handsome. I could tell from Xishui’s eyes that she liked me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps you will laugh at me, but I was really confident. However, she still chose Mu En in the end! Don’t tell me that it was because he came from Shrek Academy? I was indignant. I was really indignant. However, I couldn’t return. I had already promised Mu En that we’d remain good friends no matter who she chose. I couldn’t go back and fight for her again. That’s why I left. When I left, I left for an entire year. I dominated the continent for that one year. I attacked the strong and helped the weak. I was much more heavy-handed and vicious than I used to be. In fact, I was looking for information about the two of them. Both of them dominated as a couple in the continent, and became leading figures in the younger generation of soul masters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Time didn’t make me feel better. Eventually, I still decided to go and find them. I wanted to personally witness how blissful they were. I knew that it wasn’t going to be easy for me to escape my feelings. I’m a stubborn person. That’s why I eventually wanted to see. No matter what happened, I had to see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Destiny decided that we should meet again. They were very blissful together. When Mu En saw me, he was a little awkward. After comforting me, we even drank until we were both drunk. However, I was strangely calm then. I no longer blamed Mu En when I saw him. Your teacher is a good person. He’s really a good person. I fully believe that he didn’t play any tricks when we pursued Xishui. Liking someone can’t change. If you like someone, you like that person. If you don’t like someone, you don’t like that person. Then, I suddenly felt that I was able to finally let go. That left me very happy. It was good to be able to let go. At least no one else had to be hurt anymore, and I myself didn’t have to be hurt anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xishui was also very calm when she met me. She wasn’t as close as she was a year ago. She had become very gentle by then. It seemed as if she was ready to become Mu En’s wife. I wished both of them well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I felt it to be unfair, which was why I proposed to fight Mu En. I hoped to use a fight to alleviate the pain in my heart. I fought Mu En in front of a bunch of people from Shrek Academy. I lost, and lost very tragically. Mu En had grown a lot in one year. Perhaps it was because of love. His overall abilities were a tier above mine. Of course, it might also be because I was dispirited for an entire year.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We went to drink. I indulged in a lot of alcohol and got completely wasted. Mu En was also drunk. When I woke up in the middle of the night, my head was splitting. In the room, only Mu En and I were around. Xishui had disappeared.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There was a note on the table. It was beside Mu En, and it was written by Xishui. She told him to wash up before returning to the room after he woke up. I knew that Xishui was a clean freak. She hadn’t changed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I took the note and walked out. I walked to her room. The door was open, and she seemed to be asleep. When I walked in, I smelled a fragrance. I wasn’t too bothered then, and only silently walked to the bedside. I only wanted to take a look at her before leaving. Then, I thought that it would be my last time seeing her. In the future, I wouldn’t see either of them anymore, in case it broke my heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When I walked to the bedside, Xishui’s voice sounded. She said, ‘Why are you up so late? I’ve waited for you for a long time. You can’t escape me today. Why do we have to wait until marriage before we are together? We can be together tonight. Do you smell the fragrance? Hehe, it’s a poison that I made. It’s called Fragrance of Spring Wind and Rain’”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After hearing her voice, I didn’t dare to move. I was afraid of being found out. What was I supposed to do now that I had broken into her room? After hearing her words, I was astonished. Although I didn’t know what the Fragrance of Spring Wind and Rain was, I could guess! A warm flow went straight into my brain. My rationality told me that I should flee and find a place to neutralize the poison. However, I couldn’t bear to leave. My heart was racing then. I did something that I regret for life. Xishui pulled me in. The room was very dark then. Her breathing was very quick. So was mine. When I touched her skin, the emotions that I had been suppressing for a year were unleashed. I leapt onto her like a beast.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing until here, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong couldn’t help but open their eyes wide.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is… really a blessing in disguise! Not to even mention that Elder Xuan wouldn’t know about this, I’m sure Elder Mu doesn’t know either, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, they didn’t know what to say. Huo Yuhao was even secretly relieved that nothing like this had ever happened to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao gulped down another cup of wine and shouted at the top of his voice, “Another cup!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though many years had passed, it was evident he was still very bothered about this matter. The pain in his eyes couldn’t be hidden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao softly asked, “Elder, it’s been such a long time. What happened after that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao sighed, “When I woke up, Xishui was already up. She was seated beside me. There was a dagger in her hand, which she was slowly moving towards her chest. I was shocked. I quickly grabbed the blade of the dagger, even though it cut me. My heart was very pained. I knew that I had committed a grave error. It was also at that moment that Mu En called for Xishui.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he shut his eyes, Long Xiaoyao’s body was shaking slightly. More than a hundred years had passed, but when he thought of what had happened back then, he still couldn’t control himself. This showed how awkward the situation was for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s lips twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can Long Xiaoyao be the only one who was tortured by this incident? Teacher and Ye Xishui were both victims too. Who could be blamed for this incident?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was wrong. He should have run away. However, he was deeply in love with Ye Xishui. Was his love wrong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What about Ye Xishui? Teacher was an honest man. She only poisoned him to get closer to him. She might even have been trying to make him less jealous. While her actions were a little extreme, were they wrong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for teacher, he’s the most pitiful. He doesn’t even know what happened. His lover and his best friend actually…</span></p>
