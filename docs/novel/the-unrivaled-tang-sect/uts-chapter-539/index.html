 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the dazzling light dissipated. Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao also reappeared in mid-air. At least, it wasn’t possible to find anything wrong with them just by looking at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Well-matched?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong fluttered her wings, and a sonic boom suddenly rang out. She turned into a beam of flowing light and charged towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them had just unleashed a powerful skill, which drained quite a lot of their soul power. They couldn’t keep up such an expenditure. Given this, close-combat was undoubtedly the best choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s figure flashed, and she moved five meters in front of Huo Yuhao. Her Golden Dragon Spear turned into thousands of streaks of golden light that surrounded Huo Yuhao. A sonorous dragon roar sounded at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her spear gave her an advantage! Tang Wutong had a wealth of fighting experience. Through their earlier clash, she could tell that she had an advantage in the aspect of weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dragon Dance of the Radiant Sun versus the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses. Tang Wutong had originally believed that she could suppress Huo Yuhao. After all, he wasn’t a Titled Douluo yet. Both of them even had twin martial souls. In terms of soul power, she should possess a distinct advantage over him. However, she was stunned to realize that not only did she not gain an advantage over him as they fought, but she even felt as if her entire body had been invaded by chilly energy. She knew that that was because Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice was superior to her martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She couldn’t really accept this fact. She couldn’t believe that her Radiant Dragon Butterfly was inferior to Huo Yuhao’s Ice Jade Empress Scorpion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was competitive, including Tang Wutong. Furthermore, she had her own secrets. She already had nine rings. How could she possibly not gain the upper hand using her eighth soul skill against Huo Yuhao’s fifth soul skill?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, she had neglected one matter, which was very important. It was Huo Yuhao’s five Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he only had eight rings. However, he had five powerful Spirits! When he first obtained the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, he wasn’t the only one who managed to absorb it. His five Spirits absorbed it at the same time. His spiritual sense was strengthened, and his five Spirits all had some level of strength. Even if they couldn't fully rely on Huo Yuhao, they still had their own fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, they could reflect some of their abilities onto Huo Yuhao when necessary. The earlier attack was an example of that. Clearly, the difference between Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao was in terms of Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled when he saw the competitive look in Tang Wutong’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My dear, did you really think that I had no chance against your Golden Dragon Spear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A trace of deep-blue light appeared from Huo Yuhao’s hand without any warning. At that instant, everything seemed to freeze up in the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ding!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crisp ringing sounded. A tragic dragon scream also echoed at the same time. Tang Wutong shook tremendously. Her bright gold spear started to turn icy-blue right from the tip. At the same time, this icy-blue was spreading to her body. The streaks of light that she had formed also instantly vanished, turning into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong exclaimed in shock before she collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao also shook slightly in the air. There was an intense look of astonishment in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he was holding a dagger. It was a very weird dagger. It was completely black, and around thirty-six centimeters long. The hilt was around twelve centimeters long and five centimeters wide. The back of the dagger was very thick, but the blade was thin. There was a blue, diamond-shaped gem at the bottom of the hilt. This gem shone with a dim and mysterious glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most special part about it was that there was a thin layer of white fog surrounding the blade of this dagger. This layer of fog was formed by countless dense droplets of water. They weren’t formed from the consolidation of Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice soul power, and didn’t experience any changes because of his soul power either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dang!” The spear fell to the ground. Tang Wutong also collapsed at the same time. She had no choice but to let go of her spear. If she didn’t do that, the terrifying chill would have corroded her body through her spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She couldn’t possibly resist that terrifying chill with her soul power. It was completely unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Tang Wutong’s first time seeing the dagger in Huo Yuhao’s hand. Her spear had actually been completely defeated by that dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao drifted and landed on the ground. Right now, there was a passionate look in his eyes. He thought to himself -&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">no wonder it’s a weapon from a god!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the start, the Ghostcarving Blade had shocked him greatly. Without it, he wouldn’t have possibly become a Class 9 soul engineer in such a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nian Rongbing, the God of Emotions, didn’t give him one, but two daggers. The other one was in his hand right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had never used this dagger before. It was his first time taking it out, and he had used it to curb the Golden Dragon Spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he first held this dagger, he sensed that his life seemed to be connected to it. Even his five Spirits felt it. When he waved the dagger, it was as if all the Ultimate Ice energy in heaven and earth had gathered around it. Huo Yuhao was completely certain that the temperature of this dagger was below negative two hundred and fifty degree Celsius. Just by simply waving it, half the amount of soul power he had used on his Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses was drained. This was a testament to how much strength was needed to wield it. Even so, Huo Yuhao felt a little dizzy. Evidently, he wasn’t completely able to tap into the strength of this dagger with his current abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, are you ok?” Huo Yuhao looked at Tang Wutong as he was in awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong bit her lower lip and glared at the dagger in Huo Yuhao’s hand. “I’ve not lost yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she suddenly pressed her own forehead with her right hand. Instantly, blinding light was released from her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s terrifying might was instantly unleashed. At this instant, Huo Yuhao felt as if his entire body had turned rigid. He felt a little helpless at this point, as if he couldn’t resist at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just him. Everyone present had the same feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this instant that a weird feeling surfaced. A refreshing feeling flowed into his body from the dagger. Huo Yuhao suddenly felt as if the pressure on him had been alleviated considerably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pointed her left hand at her spear, which was still on the ground. She also slowly moved her right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that there was an extra ball of intense golden light in her right hand. That ball of golden light appeared like a fluid. It fell from her hand and landed accurately on the spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spear, which was covered in a layer of ice, had started to drift up. When Tang Wutong flung the ball of light at it, it started to shine with golden light. The originally tough layer of ice was scraped away with a deafening sound. Following this, the layer of ice broke, and a beam of golden light shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying might spread at this moment. This time, Huo Yuhao could clearly sense his demiplane shaking tremendously. It was shaking because of Tang Wutong’s golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying pressure spread in the air. The Golden Dragon Spear had transformed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was no longer a spear. The tip divided into three, and it instantly turned into a golden trident. In addition, Huo Yuhao also discovered that the golden trident rune on Tang Wutong’s forehead had disappeared as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong groaned, but was a little provocative as she stared at Huo Yuhao. She said, “Let’s see whether your dagger can resist me this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden trident fell from the air, and Tang Wutong caught it with her hand. However, her body shook a little as she caught it. Evidently, using this golden trident took a huge toll on her too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Huo Yuhao could think any further, Tang Wutong had already made her move. Her golden trident moved slightly in the air, and halos immediately shot toward Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong moved her golden trident, her dragon scale armor also turned golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her aura was simply too powerful and restraining. Even those from the Tang Sect were unable to take it, and had to step back. The surrounding soul masters naturally retreated even further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very sharp. He slashed with his dagger, and something strange happened. His dagger actually formed many dense projections. They appeared to be very chaotic and messy. However, on a closer look, they actually contained the principles of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The halos that were released from the golden trident were crushed as they clashed with the dense projections. However, Huo Yuhao’s dagger could no longer freeze Tang Wutong’s weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was becoming more and more astonished. She clearly knew how strong her move was. She didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to have been able to resist her attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Huo Yuhao was under more pressure than she thought. Right now, he had already unleashed the Rain Dragon’s Dance that Nian Rongbing had imparted to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s dagger had an extremely domineering name, Sigh of the Frozen Goddess, Morning Dew Dagger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This dagger had its own history. Before Nian Rongbing became the God of Emotions, this dagger was the first weapon he had obtained just as he was becoming famous in his plane. This Morning Dew Dagger was a dagger made by a master smith whose martial soul was a Chill Dagger. After that, Nian Rongbing provided a rock of the Frozen Goddess to this master, who attached it to the dagger and named it the Morning Dew Dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This dagger followed Nian Rongbing everywhere, and was one of his most important weapons. After he became a god, this dagger remained by his side. It grew stronger as Nian Rongbing’s divine sense became more and more acute. It was a true godly weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao couldn’t fully unleash the strength of this Morning Dew Dagger. He didn’t have divine sense yet, and had yet to inherit the godly seat of the God of Emotions. This was why his soul power was rapidly drained as he unleashed his Rain Dragon’s Dance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he wasn’t drained without reason. As he used this dagger to unleash the Rain Dragon’s Dance, his understanding of the dagger became deeper. At the same time, it was also his first time sensing the secrets of this dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rock of the Frozen Goddess on this dagger released a strong chilly energy. This energy further cultivated and compressed his soul power. After that, he poured his soul power into the dagger, mustering its true strength. The aura of divine sense was even released from the rock, further boosting his soul power. This was why he could partly unleash the strength of this godly weapon. It was also because of this that he was drained so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was equally drained as well. Her golden trident was abnormally heavy. Even though she was only using a projection of the trident, she still had to support a third of its actual weight. Furthermore, she was also using a godly skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them became slower and slower. Tang Wutong’s face was completely red, while Huo Yuhao turned paler and paler. Their soul power was being drained very rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoever’s soul power was drained first would immediately lose this fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao staggered a little, and his dagger also paused for a brief moment. The halos that were formed by Tang Wutong’s trident hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body stiffened. He was restrained by the halos, and couldn’t move a single inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tip of the golden trident was pointed at Huo Yuhao’s chest, but Tang Wutong pursed her red lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden light flashed, and the trident turned back into the Golden Dragon Spear. The golden halos on Huo Yuhao’s body also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only now that everyone watching the fight heaved a sigh of relief. The backs of their shirts were completely drenched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fight was simply too exciting. From the first clash to the subsequent flaunting of big moves to the final exchanges, it didn’t seem very lively, but the sense of doom in the air was unprecedented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen was already very grim. This was because he knew that he didn’t stand a chance against either Huo Yuhao or Tang Wutong, given his current abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a sword fanatic, and thus he was especially sensitive towards weapons. Huo Yuhao’s Morning Dew Dagger and Tang Wutong’s golden trident completely erased his desire to challenge either of them. This was because he knew that his Judgment Sword would immediately be crushed by those two weapons. The same would happen to his sword aura. This was the difference in their qualities. Even if he became a Titled Douluo, things would still not change. He would only possibly stand a chance if he was a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could the rest not feel the same way? They had learned that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were already as strong as Titled Douluo. In addition, they weren’t just as strong as ordinary Titled Douluo. They might even be able to challenge a Transcendent Douluo. No wonder their fusion skills were so strong.</span></p>
