I will be even more careful next time, and I will not use Spiritual Detection rashly to investigate what’s happening on the other side. You can rest assured that I will not treat my life like a joke.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disappointment in Huo Yuhao’s heart had vaporized after tonight’s investigation. If his opponents were too simple, they wouldn’t trigger his fighting spirit, while the Death God’s mysteriousness and how powerful it was piqued his interest greatly. He was the only successful product of Shrek Academy’s Ultimate Soldier Plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wasn’t investigating the Death God the best platform to evaluate his ability as an Ultimate Soldier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger was momentarily stunned as he stared at Huo Yuhao, who was overflowing with fighting spirit – only true heroes come forward in times of trouble and difficulty. This youth was faced with almost impossible circumstances and a dead end, but he was still full of fighting spirit and wasn’t in the least bit timid or afraid. He didn’t just have laudable spirit, he also had confidence in his own abilities at the same time! He would push forward even in the face of impossible opposition – such a role model!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu stared at Huo Yuhao, and strange lights flickered continuously in her beautiful eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow is just too outstanding. If only I were a few years younger…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The princess couldn’t help but blush a little when those thoughts ran through her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao contemplated momentarily and said, “I won’t try to give you any more advice, Yuhao, and I represent the Star Luo Empire’s millions of citizens and thank you. As soldiers, it is our duty to protect our country so that our country’s citizens will not suffer the cruelty and torment of war. From now on, please tell us if you need anything or any help with regards to your investigation – the Northwestern Field Army and I will do everything we can to give you sufficient aid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Thank you for your trust. I will go back first so that I can have a long and detailed think about this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” The White Tiger Duke and Princess Jiujiu also needed to digest the news that Huo Yuhao had brought back tonight.</span></p>

Images and scenes of his reconnaissance mission targeting the Ming Dou Mountain Range’s main peak surfaced in his mind continuously, and he didn’t let any single detail slip through his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his superior memory, everything that he had experienced just now replayed over and over again his mind with almost complete accuracy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is there really no weakness or loophole?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao opened his eyes again after two hours, and his eyebrows were tightly locked together. He had attempted many different conjectures in his mind again and again, but every single conjecture ended up at a dead end with no exception. Charging through the spiritual barrier created by the Class 9 soul tool wasn’t difficult, but the hard part was how he could come back out alive. Furthermore, investigation required time once he was inside, and would that mysterious Death God Douluo give him the time he needed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes slowly turned golden, and two shadows were released from Huo Yuhao’s body and took human form – the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lowered his voice and asked, “Brother Skydream, Ice Empress, help me think of solutions. Do I have a chance from your perspective?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm said, “Yes, of course you have a chance.” There was a sneer on his face when he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah?” Huo Yuhao looked at him in surprise. He had been wracking his brains for such a long time to no avail, and the Skydream Iceworm immediately said he had a chance once he came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm sneered and said, “You have forgotten one thing, Yuhao! You have a powerful protector. If you factor this into your calculations, you may not even be able to die even if the Death God gives you a direct hit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up and said, “Are you saying…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress chimed in, “We can’t just let him just do bad things by attaching himself to you. He has to show some responsibility.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no question that the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion were talking about the Beast God, who had a reverse scale attached to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Beast God was afraid of Huo Yuhao attaining the Godly Seat and breaking through the human limit in the future. However, he was afraid of Huo Yuhao dying at the same time. If Huo Yuhao died, the Great Star Dou Forest’s fortune and destiny would be terminated, and that could be considered absolutely destructive for them. Therefore, Di Tian had to use his own strength to protect Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao squinted his eyes as he lowered his voice and said, “Brother Skydream, Ice Empress – how much, do you guys think, of Di Tian’s strength can be channeled through that reverse scale when it takes a destructive hit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm said, “Attacking strength will be hard to say, but at least eighty percent of his defensive strength can be channeled. Previously, when he stopped you twice from feeling the God Realm’s energy, he almost used a conversion technique to bring his aura to the surface of your body. Under such circumstances, you can almost directly pass on the impact of any destructive attack to his body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Di Tian is able to control a certain amount of spatial energy with his cultivation, and he can locate your position through the reverse scale, and transfer his own strength through spatial energy. When you’re in danger, you can use spiritual power to stimulate that reverse scale so that Di Tian’s reaction can be even faster. Perhaps you can even rip him off a little. As for you, as long as there’s enough defensive strength, you can at least run into your spectral demiplane. Of course, we also have to be extra careful – we should be alright at long as we don’t take a direct hit from the Light of the Death God.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes slowly started to glow after he listened to the Skydream Iceworm’s words. A crack had seemed to appear in the dead end from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If that’s the case, then we can…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was up very early in the morning, and his spirits were a lot better compared to the previous day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Huo Yuhao, there were many times when Dong’er was his everything. His conclusion that Tang Wutong wasn’t Dong’er had affected him a lot, and investigating the Death God became the best way for him to free himself. The pain in his heart became a lot lighter if he channeled his energies and emotions into this endeavor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He cast his gaze towards the east as he left his tent. He made use of the purple energy from the east that came in the early morning and cultivated his Purple Demon Eyes. Huo Yuhao didn’t give up on cultivating his Purple Demon Eyes even though it had been raised to its limit. Cultivation had long since become the most important thing in his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Warm purple energy nourished his eyes and made his already extremely clear and transparent eyes even more glossy and full of luster, and the pale purple hues emanated an elegant and noble aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong walked out from her tent, which was next to his. She saw Huo Yuhao, who was still cultivating on his side, once she came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong realized to her surprise that she felt a little dazed when she concentrated on Huo Yuhao. In that moment, she felt as if his entire being had integrated into the air, and it seemed like his body was part of the sunlight and the air. This clairvoyant and penetrating feeling didn’t have a single trace of impurity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How can that be?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She felt like she had only had this feeling from her father before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His soul power was like great waves, and his blood qi was like mercury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With every breath that Huo Yuhao took, the qi and blood in his body, his soul power, and his spiritual power fused together almost perfectly, and circulated at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao subconsciously felt as if his cultivation was improving again.</span></p>

It was more important for him to feel the great laws of heaven and earth during the process of cultivation. Previously, he had only managed to gain that blessing from the aura of the world during his moments of deep contemplation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stood there for an hour. He exhaled a long breath when the soul power in his body followed the Mysterious Heaven Technique’s pathways back into his dantian. The air became mist, and was thin like a thread, but condensed without dissipating. This stream of air reached one hundred meters, and it stretched through the sky like a fine white line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light flickered beneath Huo Yuhao’s eyes, and golden light erupted from them. The white mist was swiftly converted into thin threads in the next moment, and these threads wrapped back around as they merged into circle after circle of light before they re-entered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s three energies reached their peak condition in that moment. There seemed to be mystical energies resonating around his body, and the vital energies of heaven and earth seemed to gather towards him with a speed visible to the human eye with every breath that he took. Even though they quickly dissipated from his body after that moment of aggregation, one could tell with a closer look that the most important parts of the vital energy of heaven and earth that was released after absorption had disappeared, as if those most important parts had been completely fused into Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This continued for almost another hour, and the sky was almost completely bright by now. The sudden onset of Huo Yuhao’s Conscientious State of cultivation ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s soul power had improved a little. More importantly, his spiritual energy and soul power had developed more chemistry, and it was the same with his blood and qi as well.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This feeling is just fantastic, and it seems like the previous night’s danger was also quite stimulating for my potential.</span></p>

He was about to wash up before having some breakfast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey!” An exclamation suddenly stopped him in his tracks.</span></p>

She seemed like she was covered with a layer of golden light under the light of the morning sun, and her pinkish-blue hair was colored with another dash of gold. She was as pretty as pretty could get.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is something up?” No matter how beautiful Tang Wutong was, she already had a different place in Huo Yuhao’s heart once he concluded that she wasn’t Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was very upset! That fellow had been standing there for two hours, and she actually watched him from the side for two hours. In the end, this guy turned around and walked off after his cultivation without even giving her a single glance. She could tell from his tone that he evidently hadn’t noticed her presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong glared at him as she asked, “To think you’re known for your spiritual power. There’s a living human being standing right next to you – didn’t you see?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said apologetically, “I’m sorry! I was too into my cultivation before this. Do you need anything else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I…” She stared at Huo Yuhao’s clean eyes that were clearly a little distant. Tang Wutong was momentarily stunned –&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">yes! I called him to stop him for nothing. But why do I feel like this fellow’s current behaviour and appearance is just so disgusting? It seems like this is worse than how he looked when he behaved like a pervert.</span></p>
