 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only several seconds were required for the entire situation to change. They were just at an impasse of sorts, but every single member from the Body Sect was suppressed and stifled in this instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How is this possible?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emotions and disbelief rose up in Wei Na’s heart. There was no way she could believe or accept that Shrek’s Seven Monsters could achieve such tacit understanding and chemistry all of a sudden from how chaotic things were before this. They hadn’t communicated with one another at all before everything happened, so how could they all flare up at the same time, and how could they all choose different targets? Furthermore, their movements connected with one another so seamlessly that there were almost no loopholes or weaknesses at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was Shrek’s Seven Monsters’ greatest strength in group battles? Rather, what was their core fighting strength? Why did they choose to go into the group round even though they knew that every single member of the Body Sect was incredibly powerful?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek’s Seven Monsters’ core fighting strength wasn’t Bei Bei’s Golden Holy Dragon, or Xu Sanshi’s Xuanwu Domain. Similarly, it wasn’t Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s martial soul fusion skill. It was the invisible and intangible Spiritual Detection that was shared amongst everyone during their group battles, and it was with this Spiritual Detection that everyone could achieve frightening chemistry and mutual understanding. This was their mightiest force, and it gave them the courage to challenge stronger opponents in a group battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tang Sect’s team had been probing their opponents from the very beginning, and they deliberately relaxed and separated themselves afterwards. Huo Yuhao had planned and created every single tactic and movement, from when they seemed like they lacked teamwork and were at a disadvantage, right up until this moment, when they all flared up at the same time. He only had one true goal: he wanted to take down the Body Sect’s strongest member, Long Aotian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how many hidden abilities Princess Wei Na possessed, and whether or not she was her team’s core, her overall prowess was still a far cry from Long Aotian’s. The most important result that Huo Yuhao wanted to achieve by taking down Long Aotian wasn’t just to weaken the Body Sect’s overall strength, he also wanted to attack their confidence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the calm and composure from before was so that they could charge up for this moment’s eruption!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blue, purple, and gold light sphere that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er had fused into transformed into an enormous vertical eye in the same moment that it returned to the ground. This was Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes, and Wang Dong’er was supporting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous eye seemed deep and profound, and a boundless world seemed to appear if one gazed closely into it. In the next moment, a frightening mixture of blue, purple, and gold light shot out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This beam of light resembled a symphony of lights as it fired straight out, and everywhere it passed by was tainted with a peculiar golden color. This included the separating layer that the Unbreakable Douluo had laid out across the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Aotian was still struggling as hard as he could inside the red Binding Light that was keeping him down. He could feel that something was wrong, and he unleashed his strongest technique, his Martial Soul True Body, in an attempt to break free from the Binding Light’s manacles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this Class 7 Binding Light was simply too powerful. The claim that it could temporarily restrict a Soul Douluo’s abilities wasn’t just a myth, and even though Long Aotian had unleashed his Martial Soul True Body and his entire body had gone incandescent, he could only watch as the bindings around him slowly broke down. However, the multi-colored beam had already arrived in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This beam passed through him in the blink of an eye. Just when everyone from the Body Sect believed that this attack was focused on Long Aotian, the enormous, three meter-wide tricolored light beam instantly elongated, and almost split the competition stage in two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan still had Jiang Yixi immobilized with her Soft Bone Lock, and disappeared in a flash through Instant Shift. Jiang Yixi couldn’t even react as she was swallowed by the tricolored light beam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s first martial soul fusion skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Light holding Long Aotian finally broke apart, but he had been transformed into a golden statue. He wasn’t the only one; Jiang Yixi had also become a golden statue after she was struck by the Golden Road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Aotian was exceptionally powerful, but Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er both had twin martial souls, one was a Soul Emperor and the other a Soul King. How could their combined efforts, their martial soul fusion skill, not be powerful? They had teamed up to defeat and best mighty Soul Sages before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The best way to fight against the Golden Road was to avoid being struck by it. In the end, the Golden Road couldn’t lock onto a target. But once struck…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Martial Soul True Body, dispelled; martial soul, dispelled. Intense light and spiritual energies gravely corroded their bodies, which were frozen in place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gigantic tricolored vertical eye reverted into a tricolored sphere, and the temperature in the air plummeted in the next moment. The tricolored sphere transformed once more, and black and white lights intertwined as a terrifying pressure was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ice-cold frost and snow swept up as a black hammer appeared with transparent Ultimate Ice condensed on its surface. A huge blizzard immediately billowed around Long Aotian with his body in the middle, and the freezing low temperature created another transparent layer of frost and ice on his body, which had already become a golden statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A giant formed from frost and snow grasped an enormous, fearsome hammer, and it seemed like it was going to tear the world to pieces as it plunged down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This… this was the fusion between the Ice Jade Empress’ Scorpion and the Clear Sky Hammer. This was one of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s other martial soul fusion skills!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blaze Amidst the Frost, the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Binding Light, the Golden Road, and the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer. These three supreme abilities were what Huo Yuhao had prepared to end Long Aotian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao might not have been able to defeat Long Aotian even if his body was fully recovered one-on-one. However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er against Long Aotian in a one-versus-two situation meant that Long Aotian didn’t stand a chance at all. Huo Yuhao’s soul power was being consumed at an alarming rate, but Wang Dong’er was the main director now, and it wasn’t very problematic for them to unleash two martial soul fusion skills at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Long Aotian has been eliminated!” Wei Na screamed at the top of her lungs, and her voice sounded piercing and shrill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her exclamation was directed at the Unbreakable Douluo, Zheng Zhan. How could she not tell that Long Aotian, who martial soul was being stripped from his body, was absolutely unable to resist this attack?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Zheng Zhan seemed to be half a beat slower, and he was one step too slow to save Long Aotian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sharp scream rang out from Wei Na’s mouth, and the five soul rings on her body suddenly transformed at this moment. Her two yellow, two purple, and one black soul rings suddenly became six identical black soul rings as the fourth of her new soul rings sparkled with black light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could see twisting and contorting waves ripple from her body amid her ear-piercing scream. A silver-white light sphere flickered behind her back, which seemed to be composed of countless rolls and folds. It was the shape of a brain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was her fourth soul skill, Wail of the Banshee. It was a formidable soul skill that layered spiritual and sonic energies together, and it was a ten-thousand year soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wei Na couldn’t be bothered with anything else when she could tell that Zheng Zhan would be a little too late. She immediately unleashed a powerful ability that was the most likely to save Long Aotian, and couldn’t be bothered with hiding her second martial soul’s soul rings anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could tell from her second martial soul that she had only begun to attach soul rings to her spiritual-type martial soul after she became a Soul King or a Soul Emperor. Every single ring was a ten-thousand year soul ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though she could have done it better, this was enough. It was hard for soul masters with spiritual-type martial souls to obtain suitable soul rings in the first place, Huo Yuhao being an obvious example. It was even harder to find hundred-thousand year soul rings; hundred-thousand year spiritual-type soul beasts did exist, but every single one was exceptionally powerful, and that meant hunting and killing one was very challenging. It wasn’t that easy for the Body Sect to find and kill soul beasts like that even with their host of powerful individuals, let alone finding and killing as many as nine for Wei Na. The Body Sect was a sect, it didn’t exist just for Wei Na herself, and even if they had the ability to help her accomplish all that, the sect’s other members would call this unreasonable resource allocation into question.</span></p>

She was the Snowdemon Sect’s second strongest team member after Long Aotian!</span></p>

Wei Na couldn’t be bothered with friendly fire because Long Aotian was in a perilous situation of life or death, and even her teammates were subject to this mass control-type soul skill.</span></p>

His Spirit Eyes only had five soul rings, but what kind of soul rings were they? Without talking about his other soul rings, his first soul ring was a million-year soul ring, while his spiritual power had undergone multiple evolutions and was in the concrete-immaterial realm. Furthermore, he was teaming up with Wang Dong’er in this attack. How could he be so easily shaken?</span></p>

He no longer had his martial soul to protect him, and Ultimate Ice had invaded his bone marrow, while the Golden Road’s intense corrosive effects were encroaching frantically onto his wounded body. He would possibly have a chance to resist everything if he were in his peak condition, but now…</span></p>

However, there was only sorrow in his heart. If somebody had told him before the tournament that he would die in combat, he would have been full of disbelief and disdain towards that comment.
