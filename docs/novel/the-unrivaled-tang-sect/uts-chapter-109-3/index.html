 <p><strong>Book 13: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 109.3: The Absolute Defense and the Star Protection&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Ling Luochen’s Icemist constantly engulfed the entire Star Barrier, and the 18 stars above the Star Barrier were slowly dimming. But if things were dragged on at this pace, they might not get in before the seal trapping Ma Xiaotao was released.</p>
 <p>“What do we do?” Wang Dong asked Huo Yuhao anxiously.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao did not have a clue either. As the effect of his Spiritual Detection Sharing was crippled, he had fallen into a bewildered state. Hearing Wang Dong’s anxious voice only increased his depression. A competition of this level was out of his control! He wanted to sweep aside this sense of helplessness, but the gap in cultivation rendered him unable to do so.</p>
 <p>“Do you know why you are so helpless?” An old voice rang in his head clearly.</p>
 <p>“Elder Yi.” Huo Yuhao responded in his consciousness.</p>
 <p>Electrolux answered his own question. “That’s because you don’t fully understand yourself. You haven’t used your control to the fullest. While increasing one’s cultivation is important, you will be unable to reach the top no matter how hard you cultivate if you don’t understand your own capabilities. After this competition, I want you to enter closed-door cultivation. Understand that power cannot decide everything all the time. The ability to control everything that you possess, and exhibit your capabilities appropriately in different situations, that is true power. For now, act according to what I tell you.”</p>
 <p>“Yuhao, what do we do?” In Wang Dong’s eyes, Huo Yuhao was entirely in a daze. This was a critical situation. Wang Dong was aware that his own abilities could not faze the light barrier. In this battle, the only chance he had was if he combined with Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened, and he shouted, “Senior Ling, maintain the strength of the Icemist and help to block our figures. Wang Dong, let’s strike.” As he said that, he turned around suddenly and opened his arms wide. He hugged Wang Dong tightly and strongly. Their spirits and soul powers combined and merged into one entity.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“The strength of the opponent is derived from Star Power. What’s the origin of the Star Power? It’s light. No matter how they are structured internally, they are all made of light. They can be considered a high level performance of light,” advised Electrolux.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Within the Icemist,</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s pupils emitted a dim golden glow on one side.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Wang Dong unleashed his Radiant Butterfly Goddess, spreading his elegant wings behind his back.</p>
 <p>Alternating shades of blue, purple and gold shone within the mist.</p>
 <p>When the illusory figure of the huge Radiant Butterfly Goddess spread opened her wings and hugged the illusory figure of the Spirit Eyes, a dazzling purplish-golden light burst out. A glow that descended from the sky engulfed the illusory figures. A huge bluish-golden pupil directed its gaze towards the front. Blue, purple and golden light that intertwined with each other shot out from the depths of the pupil that seemed to contain a boundless world.</p>
 <p>A radiance laced with a magical color shot straight forward, locking onto the light of the Star Barrier.</p>
 <p>Blocked by the dense Icemist, neither the audience below the stage nor the competitors inside the Star Barrier could see what was happening. Even Princess Jiu Jiu did not have a clue as her Starguiding Technique could only sense their positions with her.</p>
 <p>The Icemist subtly diminished. It was as if its aura of ultimacy had been lost. However, Princess Jiu Jiu’s attention was entirely on Dai Yueheng at this moment as Huang Heyun’s second wave of Demontiger’s Heavenshock was about to strike Dai Yueheng. To her, this was the key to determine victory. She ignored the four outside the barrier. She reckoned that even though Huo Yuhao was very talented, he was unable to pose much of a threat to her.</p>
 <p>However, Princess Jiu Jiu’s expression changed the next instant.</p>
 <p>The dim golden glow on the Star Barrier suddenly turned a bright golden color. The entire barrier actually began to emit the same radiance as the 18 stars above the barrier. Princess Jiu Jiu could only faintly see what was in front of her, only catching a short glimpse of a huge pupil briefly appearing before vanishing again. In the next moment, she discovered to her horror that her Star Barrier seemed to have been melted. Drops of golden fluid flowed down the surface of the barrier. Furthermore, the soul power that she was continuously injecting was forcefully stopped.</p>
 <p>This was impossible. She was now feeling like Dai Yueheng had felt earlier. She had no idea how the four members outside were able to damage her Star Barrier.</p>
 <p>However, there was nothing impossible in this world. At the moment when the Star Barrier was broken through, Dai Yueheng reacted to his opponents’ assault.</p>
 <p>Blinding white light was suddenly unleashed from his body and a huge figure of a white tiger surfaced above his head, instantly fused with his body. Dai Yueheng let out a furious roar. His first, third, fifth and sixth soul ring flashed at the same time.</p>
 <p>His three strengthening skills, the White Tiger’s Shield, the White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation and the White Tiger’s Devilgod Transformation were powered to their peaks with his Soul Emperor cultivation.</p>
 <p>From his pair of almost foot-long golden tiger claws, a cold radiance was emitted. In the next instant, his body suddenly disappeared from the bright radiance that had flashed from white to gold.</p>
 <p>A huge ‘kill’ character 杀 suddenly appeared out of nowhere and collided with the black tiger formed by the Demontiger’s Heavenshock. Sharps streaks of piering and splitting were heard inside of the Star Barrier. It was combined with the roars of two raging tigers that were wreaking havoc to their surroundings.</p>
 <p>Huang Heyun and the rest were indeed very powerful, as they had combined their soul power using the Nine Transformations Soulrite. Their overall power had already reached the intermediate stage of the Soul Sage rank. In terms of soul power, Dai Yueheng, who was only a Soul Emperor, was completely suppressed.</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu Jiu had meticulously chosen Huang Heyun to be placed at the very front. She was very familiar with Dai Yueheng’s White Tiger martial soul, so she had created this strategy to specifically counter Dai Yueheng. Huang Heyun’s Darkdemon Tiger was only slightly inferior to the White Tiger. However, the difference was minimal. Along with the enhancement of the Starglory Spell, this suppression of martial souls was completely removed. Under such a circumstance, the might of Dai Yueheng’s White Tiger no longer had to be feared.</p>
 <p>However, things did not always go according to plan. Princess Jiu Jiu could never predict that Huang Heyun’s state of mind would experience changes during the battle, resulting in the failure of his second strike, which was supposed to be the defining blow.</p>
 <p>The change in his state of mind was not because of Dai Yueheng, but Ma Xiaotao, who had fought him earlier.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was just too powerful. Even after being infused with the Starglory Spell, Huang Heyun had still felt completely helpless. He was clearly aware that Ma Xiaotao was stronger than Dai Yueheng. After they defeating Dai Yueheng, their next target would be Ma Xiaotao!</p>
 <p>Hence, Huang Heyun did not unleash his fifth soul skill to defeat Dai Yueheng according to the original plan. Instead he used his third soul skill. A thousand year soul ring skill was significant weaker than a ten thousand year soul kill. However, Dai Yueheng coughing up blood and seemed to be on the verge of falling. With his comrades supporting him, he had felt that a thousand year soul skill backed with the power of a Soul Sage was enough to finish him off. By this, he could conserve his soul power to deal with Ma Xiaotao. Using soul skills with the combined power of four people caused the toll on his body to be rather big. The reason why they combined only four of them and not five was because no one could handle the accumulation of five individual soul powers.</p>
 <p>Against any other person, Huang Heyun’s decision would have been correct. However, Dai Yueheng was from Shrek Academy. He was a monster, and a very experienced one at that. Knowing that he had no room to escape, his potential was stimulated. In a short span of time, he managed to pin point Huang Heyun’s flaw.</p>
 <p>The result of the infusing four people’s soul power into one person boosted his soul power to tremendous heights. However, there was also a drawback. This drawback was very simple: their attacks became very rigid.</p>
 <p>While the Demontiger’s Heavenshock was full of power and speed, it lacked flexibility. Dai Yueheng managed to unleash his strongest soul skill under the support of his three strengthening skills.</p>
 <p>White Tiger’s Extermination!</p>
 <p>Using this close-combat skill allowed him to dodge the charge of the Demontiger’s Heavenshock. Turning around, he managed to forcefully disperse this attack while taking six consecutive strikes from the side.</p>
 <p>Although Dai Yueheng vomiting more blood, he took advantage of the situation and dashed towards Bei Bei in the distance.</p>
 <p>After losing their opportunity, another drawback was revealed. The four of them lacked dexterity. With Dai Yueheng’s cultivation, it was not easy for his opponent to force him to take another blow without determining his exact location.</p>
 <p>“Idiot.” Princess Jiu Jiu could not help but curse. As the saying went, “A weak teammate does more harm than a strong opponent.” What added to her misery was that her Star Barrier had collapsed with a loud, booming sound.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“The effect of your martial soul fusion skill, the Golden Road, is to melt and degrade. It is a combination of the light element and spiritual power. This skill of yours only fires in a straight line but will have no problems hitting on a stationary barrier. Even if the opponent’s defense-type soul skill isolates other elements, all you have to do is to control the power of degradation within the Golden Road and convert it into the power to melt,” said Electrolux.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When the Golden Road struck the Star Barrier, Huo Yuhao could clearly feel the collision between the Golden Road and the Star Barrier.</p>
 <p>In the past, the Golden Road had passed through everything in a straight line whenever it was shot. This was the first time it was blocked. However, the instant the bright, tri-colored radiance was blocked, it spread over the Star Barrier.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao suddenly felt something in his mind being stirred. A wave of weird power passed from his forehead and guided his mind to his Golden Road. With the help of the strange power, he was able to clearly differentiate the concepts of melting and degradation.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao controlled his spiritual power and converted the power of degradation into that of melting. To him, everything happened very slowly, but in reality, it all was completed in the blink of an eye.</p>
