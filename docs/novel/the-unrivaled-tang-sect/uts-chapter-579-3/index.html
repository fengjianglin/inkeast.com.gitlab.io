 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, she was Ma Xiaotao. At this moment, she was no longer the Phoenix Holy Lady. She had lost consciousness, and was drifting in the sky like a patch of red clouds, slowly falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu revealed a cold smile on his face. He pointed his toes to the ground and wanted to leap up to catch her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was at this moment that a pitch-black hole appeared below Ma Xiaotao without any warning. It was like a slit had opened up in the sky. Ma Xiaotao was instantly devoured, and the slit sealed up. She disappeared just like that. Not even her aura was left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu was completely dazed in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She’s gone? The Phoenix Holy Lady is gone? What kind of power was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An ethereal projection flashed. Another person appeared in the air. It was Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Icy War God’s Armor had dimmed significantly. Its original deep-blue hue had turned shallower. There were even scorch marks left behind on this Class 9 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His expression wasn’t shown, as his visor was lowered. However, his Ultimate Ice aura remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve won. This is my third one.” Huo Yuhao said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu lifted his head to look at him. The sinister look in his eyes turned even more intense. “Huo Yuhao, where did you take my Phoenix Holy Lady?” His script definitely didn’t involve her disappearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “You don’t need to know that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu’s eyes turned colder. “Great, great, great!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What left Huo Yuhao surprised was that Zhong Liwu flew back to the ground after he finished saying those three words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this his only reaction?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it was just like this. In Zhong Liwu’s mind, would he be afraid that he couldn’t get the Phoenix Holy Lady if his plan succeeded and he controlled Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he wasn’t anxious. He suppressed his rage. However, he immediately waved at his own side after he landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fourth person representing the Sun Moon Empire, or rather, the Holy Ghost Church, appeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black figure leapt out and charged towards Huo Yuhao. This time, the Holy Ghost Church didn’t give Huo Yuhao any buffer time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Phoenix Holy Lady had been defeated and abducted by Huo Yuhao. But that was fine! Zhong Liwu had still managed to achieve his goal. He believed that Huo Yuhao would definitely have been greatly drained after that earlier attack, no matter how strong he was. How could he possibly survive the next round?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, he didn’t personally fight in the fourth round. He never did anything he wasn’t confident in. This was why the fourth round was still a prelude to his personal involvement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When that black figure charged towards him, Huo Yuhao immediately recognized him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was familiar. Yes, he was a very familiar person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the Scorpion Tiger Douluo, Zhang Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao first met the Scorpion Tiger Douluo, Zhang Peng was pursuing and trying to kill him. Then, Huo Yuhao had Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er with him. Xian Lin’er fought Zhang Peng, and they ended in a stalemate. That time, it was also Huo Yuhao’s first meeting Long Xiaoyao. He only managed to chase Long Xiaoyao off through a wager.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long ago, Huo Yuhao had learned from Mu En that Long Xiaoyao didn’t harbor any ill-intentions towards him. Otherwise, he would have been able to kill him at their first meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was no longer as weak as he used to be. He was a powerful Titled Douluo now. This Scorpion Tiger Douluo was already a Transcendent Douluo back then. So many years had passed. His cultivation would have increased. Even though he wasn’t as strong as Feng Ling, the difference wouldn’t be too great either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng let out a low-pitched tiger roar before he appeared in front of Huo Yuhao. Behind him, a projection of a giant scorpion tiger surfaced. He instantly punched a fist towards Huo Yuhao’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny opened. Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spiritual Shock at the Scorpion Tiger Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had always been very good at making use of his strengths. He was doing that right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng groaned, and intense black light was released from his body. It turned into a small mirror that flashed with black light in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock struck the mirror, it was instantly refracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Oh? It can refract spiritual power? No wonder he didn’t purchase a spiritual defensive-type soul tool, and no wonder Zhong Liwu sent him to fight. The Holy Ghost Church has strong foundations indeed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that small mirror still cracked, even though it had refracted Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock. Zhang Peng’s body shook a little, and his fist arrived right in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pushed his right hand forward. He was using his Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, a skill that came from the Tang Sect’s Secret Techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was no longer the same Huo Yuhao who had just entered the sect. When he used his Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, it felt very profound and magical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng only felt a strong suction force coming towards him, causing his fist to deviate to one side. At the same time, Huo Yuhao pressed his other hand against Zhang Peng’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng roared, and his entire body started to shine brightly. His body suddenly expanded, and his other arm straightened like a blade. After this, he slashed it towards Huo Yuhao’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s shoulder shook. The pull from his left hand and push from his right hand brought his palms together. Suddenly, strong whirlpool-like soul power was instantaneously unleashed. A terrifyingly strong destructive force was released. Before Zhang Peng’s attack could even hit Huo Yuhao, he was already knocked far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the observers’ point of view, there was nothing separating Huo Yuhao and Zhang Peng. However, Zhong Liwu revealed an evidently satisfied look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Huo Yuhao’s reaction, he could tell that his abilities had weakened slightly compared to before. He didn’t even use his Ultimate Ice immediately. Evidently, he must have had been affected when he was resisting the Fire Phoenix Holy Lady earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Zhang Peng moved back, he let out a tiger roar, revealing his True Body. A huge scorpion tiger appeared out of thin air. The sky turned dark. Following this, beams of black light formed in the air. They turned into countless, flashing black needles, which shot towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What is this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Scorpion Tail Needle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Scorpion Tiger Douluo’s lethal weapon was his scorpion tail. This was a very powerful soul skill that Zhang Peng possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The needles blocked off all of Huo Yuhao’s escape routes. This was the type of attack that a Transcendent Douluo could unleash when he used his True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squirmed in the air. After this, he turned illusory. When the needles were about to hit him, he turned into broken pieces and disappeared into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Concealment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw Huo Yuhao disappearing, the soul engineers from the Sun Moon Empire had the biggest reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s concealment abilities had caused great problems for the Sun Moon Empire. Without such abilities, he couldn’t have destroyed so many of the Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools! Without his concealment abilities, how could he have threatened the Sun Moon Empire’s army by himself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally used his concealment abilities in the fourth fight. This also confirmed everyone’s suspicions that he was the one who had destroyed so many of the Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools. It was him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The needles swept past, but didn’t hit anything. When Huo Yuhao reappeared, he was already above the Scorpion Tiger Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A white halo silently flew out from Huo Yuhao before landing on Zhang Peng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Scorpion Tiger Douluo only felt a little giddy, and he was soon engulfed by intense weakness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the upgraded version of Mass Enfeeblement, Singular Enfeeblement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could use his spiritual power in ways other than his Spiritual Shock. That small mirror that drifted above Zhang Peng could resist offensive spiritual attacks. However, it was helpless against such an auxiliary spiritual ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes enabled him to adopt different ways of fighting. He didn’t just have to fight directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was weakened, Zhang Peng’s figure flashed, and he instantly picked up speed in the air. Wings extended from his ribs, enabling him to make a turn in the air. When he faced Huo Yuhao again, his needles shot from the sky once more. This time, they covered an even bigger area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual cultivation was far beneath Huo Yuhao. He had already unleashed all his spiritual power earlier, but he couldn’t discover Huo Yuhao at all. Zhang Peng also knew that it was impossible for him to locate his enemy using his spiritual power. Since this was the case, he used his attack to seek Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The needles seemed to have taken effect. Huo Yuhao didn’t choose to hide himself this time, but his body turned illusory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when the needles flew past his body, his body only rippled. He didn’t get hurt at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s not real?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng was astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he felt as if everyone in this world was spinning. Everything seemed to become unreal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only those observing could tell that there was an extra whirlpool above his head. This whirlpool was revolving very quickly, as if it were sucking out Zhang Peng’s soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Huo Yuhao’s fourth soul skill, Spiritual Confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was only able to perfectly demonstrate the strength of this soul skill by strong spiritual suppression. He had the greatest advantage in terms of his spiritual power. Why would he not use it? He had only used a part of it in the earlier rounds. In this fight, he was counting on his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his Spirit Eyes only had eight soul rings right now, Huo Yuhao still had the confidence to resist the strongest Ultimate Douluo in the world with it.</span></p>
