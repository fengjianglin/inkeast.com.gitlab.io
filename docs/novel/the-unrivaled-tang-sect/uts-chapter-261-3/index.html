The flaming knives bore down on it, but they were actually reflected, and the fire lady seemed like she was waving her flaming knives to slash herself, while her body suddenly grew a little slack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Life Reflecting Shield’s defensive abilities were absolutely outstanding. However, its reflecting effect was definitely nothing much against the fire lady, who didn’t have a life of her own. Furthermore, the fire lady was emanating Ultimate Fire, so Skydream’s agonizing howls instantly rang out in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fire lady didn’t have life, so the Life Reflecting Shield’s most prominent feature of absorbing the opponent’s life energy to reflect it back couldn’t take effect at all. This naturally made Skydream extremely annoyed and frustrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I can’t use it anymore, I’ll hurt brother Skydream!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao exasperatedly realized the sorrowful situation he was in. Every single ability he possessed was being weakened as he continued to fight this fire lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally wasn’t willing to be passive, and he wasn’t about to allow the fire lady to beat him down. The Life Reflecting Shield didn’t hurt the fire lady, but it bought him enough time to make a comeback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Orange-gold light flickered, and the little Snow Lady emerged behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady wasn’t used to the searing environment around her, and her tiny eyebrows began to frown as she began to chitter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao began to unleash his abilities at this moment. The Ice Empress Jade Scorpion’s five soul rings lit up at the same time – one red, and four orange soul rings sparkled as his Ultimate Ice was channeled to the highest possible level. His fourth soul ring sparkled brilliantly, and the Snow Lady’s figure became a little illusory as the Snow Empress’ arrogance descended upon the world once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the moment that the Snow Empress’ projection appeared, the fire lady in front of her and the Blazing Delicate Apricot not far from where they were became a little listless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress was formed by the Icesky Snow Lady. Even though she didn’t have her original body, she still retained some of the aura of her formidable seven hundred thousand year cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, the Snow Empress could be considered the strongest entity amongst ice-type soul beasts, and her element was a natural counter to fire. Even though the Blazing Delicate Apricot was next to the Blazing Sunspring, she couldn’t help but feel a little fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two figures merged back together in the next moment, and an icy-white beam of light erupted from Huo Yuhao with his body at the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the fusion between the Snow Empress’ Snowy Dance of the Brilliant Sun and Huo Yuhao’s Domain of Perpetual Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, Huo Yuhao’s strongest area control soul skill, had been unleashed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Physical attacks were nearly useless against the fire lady, and what use was his Spirit Eyes’ spiritual power against something that was just a puppet? Perhaps he could attack the Blazing Delicate Apricot directly, but if he infuriated her? Furthermore, she was a hundred-thousand year soul beast, so how effective could his spiritual attacks be? Huo Yuhao didn’t have the time for that anyway, as the fire lady continued to pressure him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had experimented with his attacks to the point where he was being suppressed on all fronts, so he finally unleashed his trump card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques were formidable, and they were truly unrivaled among all other snow and ice skills. The icy-blue colors that suddenly erupted immediately dispelled the scorching heat around him, and began to extend outward with lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very likely that his Spirit Eyes had undergone a second awakening and qualitative change, which led to a great boost in his spiritual level, and especially his control of spiritual power. Once the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was unleashed, it immediately blanketed the fire lady as if it loomed over the entire world. Huo Yuhao was like a blooming snow plum flower as he bore down on her from the sky amid the scorching heat. Snowflakes flurried as they threatened to consume the fire lady, while Huo Yuhao himself was hidden within his domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was feeling the full effects of how his spiritual control had been amplified. He felt as if every snowflake within his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was under his control, and his spiritual power was like an enormous formless web that connected them all. His domain felt as if it were a part of him and he could control it at whim. The sensation was just too fantastic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the pressure that Huo Yuhao felt suddenly increased exponentially. The release of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice meant he was no longer just targeting the fire lady, he was going against the superheated environment around him. This also meant he was targeting the Blazing Delicate Apricot and the Blazing Sunspring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice’s mighty strength was limited to less than thirty percent of its original power inside this extreme environment. The scorching heat meant there was hardly any moisture in the air, and the temperature itself was incredibly high. Huo Yuhao’s soul power was consumed continuously, as if it were leaking out of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fire lady seemed to feel the immense threat borne by Huo Yuhao’s Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, and she began to move the moment Huo Yuhao’s domain was unleashed. However, this wasn’t an attack; she began to move sideways with lightning speed as she darted rapidly towards the Blazing Delicate Apricot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally directed his domain in pursuit of the fire lady. The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was about to touch the fire lady. Large amounts of water vapor could be seen evaporating from the fire lady’s body, while her scarlet-gold colors swiftly grew dull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, something interfered with Huo Yuhao’s battle once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Sunspring seemed infuriated, and it exploded as if it were a mother trying to protect her kid. The burning red spring water surged into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Sunspring didn’t retaliate against Huo Yuhao. The red spring water surged vertically into the air, but this sudden instance of extremely high temperature was enough to dispel half of Huo Yuhao’s Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The domain that was just about to envelop the fire lady naturally missed its target, and could only continue forward. The fire lady took this opportunity to run behind the Blazing Delicate Apricot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The domain inevitably loomed over the Blazing Delicate Apricot, and the flower’s body erupted with an intense golden-red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What happened afterwards?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no “afterwards”…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Sunspring and the Blazing Delicate Apricot worked together against the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, and the entire domain dissipated to the point where not a single snowflake remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s cheeks were flushed red from the intense heat, and he stumbled backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the Blazing Sunspring’s eruption only lasted for a single moment, and the temperature dropped back down once the red spring water returned to the well. However, the fire lady came out from behind the Blazing Delicate Apricot as she flashed her twin knives, and raced toward Huo Yuhao mercilessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait!” Huo Yuhao shouted at the top of his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” The Blazing Delicate Apricot sounded rather bored, and answered extremely casually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth twitched as he said, “This is cheating, senior. The Blazing Sunspring’s eruption can still be explained because it was affected by my Ultimate Ice aura. But how am I to continue with this test if you interfere as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot’s voice was full of surprise. “What? Cheating? How am I cheating? The Blazing Sunspring has nothing to do with me. You’re the one who triggered it, yes? The reason why I interfered was because you attacked me too. Your domain was coming towards me, and that domain carried Ultimate Ice, so was I supposed to just let you beat me down? What if you severed my spiritual root? If you can’t pass, then you can’t. Don’t find subjective reasons, and if you can’t pass the test, that means you’re never going to get that book from You You.”</span></p>

If you do, then continue. Otherwise, please leave us be. We don’t really welcome humans in here anyway. I will let you live because of your determination. Oy, look, that little fellow is so mischievous! She’s gone for a bath.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was right. While the Blazing Delicate Apricot and Huo Yuhao were talking, the fire lady had actually jumped into the Blazing Sunspring, and only came back out when the flower called her back. The fire lady had recovered completely from her weakened aura and energy, and once again sparkled with scarlet-gold light. She seemed like she had been revitalized. That also meant that if Huo Yuhao continued with the battle, he would be facing the fire lady once more in her peak condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression grew dark. He took a deep breath and said decisively, “I want to try one more time, senior. However, I wish to give everything I have, and it will be a proper defeat even if I lose. Do you mind letting me leave your arena to replenish my soul power, so that I can have a proper and final fight with the fire lady?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s up to you,” the Blazing Delicate Apricot said, “However, I can’t guarantee that other plants won’t attack you if you leave my arena.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if she hadn’t said anything at all . He would be affected by the intense heat if he didn’t leave the area around her, and his recovery would be severely impeded, to the point where he could be weakened instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surprisingly, Huo Yuhao grit his teeth and sat down on the spot. The Ultimate Ice aura around him disappeared, and a faint golden light replaced it. The golden radiance was full of spiritual undulations that protected him within. The air around him was so hot that heat waves were rising from the ground, but it didn’t seem like it affected him much at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a Class 6 Milk Bottle in Huo Yuhao’s hands he used to gradually replenish his soul power. The Blazing Delicate Apricot seemed like she liked to cheat, but she didn’t take this opportunity to send the fire lady to attack him. She let the fire lady, who had been restored to her peak condition, stand to one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was quite far from the battle, but she could see and hear everything that was happening. There was no question that the Blazing Delicate Apricot had been hindering Huo Yuhao this entire time even though she had said she wasn’t going to interfere. In addition to the Blazing Sunspring’s effects, Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice had been greatly weakened. Wang Qiu’er didn’t see a single thread of a chance that Huo Yuhao could emerge victorious despite all his fighting spirit and willpower.</span></p>
