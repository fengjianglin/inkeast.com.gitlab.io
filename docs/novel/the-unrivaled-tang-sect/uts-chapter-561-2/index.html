 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was common for the commander and the military supervisor from any country and any point in time in history to share conflicting opinions. After all, there was a reason why military supervisors existed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was naturally not the military supervisor who Xu Tianran wanted to send over. However, the Holy Ghost Church was simply too powerful, so he had no choice but to do so. The Holy Ghost Ghost had long been trying to create a bigger presence within the Sun Moon Empire’s army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the effects of their participation had never gone particularly well. After all, evil soul masters were often ostracized by most people—regardless of whether they were soul masters or soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After watching Zhongli Wu leave the tent, Ju Zi squinted as she crossed her arms in front of her chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These annoying evil soul masters… With them around, it will be very difficult for me to execute my plan perfectly. If there’s a chance…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their use for the Holy Ghost Church had been diminishing for a while. After the Body Sect had been completely destroyed, the only use for the Holy Ghost Church was to fight against the powerful cultivators from Shrek Academy. If not for the existence of two Ultimate Douluo within the Holy Ghost Church, Xu Tianran would have long since employed a method to force them to surrender to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came to dealing with the Holy Ghost Church, both Ju Zi and Xu Tianran had the same ideas. This sect which was full of evil soul masters was bound to create trouble for them in the future. Once the Sun Moon Empire conquered the entire continent, the Holy Ghost Church would definitely think of a way to wrest the throne for themselves. With regards to how exactly they would do it, both Xu Tianran and Ju Zi were certain that those mysterious evil soul masters must have their own ways to achieve that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Knowing how her son would become the future ruler of the entire continent, Ju Zi was determined to not let the Holy Ghost Church succeed in their scheme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the thought of her son made Ju Zi’s body tremble as the harsh look in her eyes became gentler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before she left Radiant City, she had gotten the help of an extremely powerful individual within the Sun Moon Empire to protect her son. She was not afraid that an external enemy would target her son. On the contrary, she was worried about the Holy Ghost Church! Now, she was most afraid that the Holy Ghost Church would take action against her son, Xu Yunhan. That would truly be horrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The actual battle on the battlefield must end as soon as possible. It was only after the war had ended that she could finally return to Radiant City and make her next move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint cold look appeared in Ju Zi’s pupils. The task which she was about to embark on was not just about conquering the entire continent. Besides, there was no need to rush the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the Tang Sect in Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hummmm!” Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core vibrated intensely as it continued to radiate powerful spiritual fluctuations from within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Eye of Destiny had somehow opened itself without him even knowing about it. The light from the spiritual soul core sparkled within the dark room. However, it never stopped vibrating and trembling in an unstable manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked more determined than ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fluid-like spiritual power that Elder Mu had left for him to control the spiritual soul core had already disappeared. After absorbing that spiritual power, his spiritual soul core had become a lot stronger. At the same time, it had also bought precious time for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the Ultimate Ice soul core at his chest area had become a lot stronger and larger as well. The speed at which it was rotating was no longer observable by the human eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know exactly how much longer he persevered with Elder Mu’s help, but he had witnessed the Ultimate Ice soul core at his chest area grow more than three times its original size in this amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Ultimate Ice soul core had yet to take on a shape, it was no longer as fragile and feeble as before. It had become a lot stronger, and seemed to be as solid as an ice crystal. The effects of its rotation speed on his spiritual soul core were also becoming greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mutual collision between the two soul cores caused Huo Yuhao to tremble uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, the Snow Empress and Ice Empress showcased their abilities. In fact, they had been going about their tasks in an extremely stable manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the effects of the Dragon Pill, Huo Yuhao’s body had become a lot stronger. He was at the very least able to persevere till now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Star Anise was not making any moves, Little Bai had been supporting Huo Yuhao by using his power to fortify his passageways and internal organs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Ya had taken a break after Elder Mu’s spiritual power had fused into Huo Yuhao’s body. Now, she was getting ready to lend a hand when necessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the Yin Yang Complement technique was at a stage where it was already too late to back out. Huo Yuhao was clear that if he were to fail now, he would not only be sustaining injuries. This was because the Ultimate Ice ball of energy at his chest area had already become considerably strong. It had already absorbed close to thirty percent of his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this amount of soul power was still insufficient to form a soul core, the compressed extreme energy was still able to blow his dragon blood enhanced body to pieces if it were to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stabilized his focus and continued his current state. After all the tribulations he had gone through, Huo Yuhao was able to keep himself calm and focused during times like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were to still fail even with the help of his six Spirits and Elder Mu, there was little chance that he could succeed in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he had to persevere and push on no matter what. He only had one shot at this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, his spiritual soul core was rotating in a furious manner. It was apparent that the spiritual power that Elder Mu had injected into his head was only able to temporarily delay it. At the same time, it had nourished the spiritual soul core and made it a lot stronger. The energy that the spiritual soul core was radiating now was becoming a lot stronger. It was attacking Huo Yuhao’s determination like waves hitting the shore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual power that was released by the spiritual soul core under Huo Yuhao’s control would immediately be torn up by the Ultimate Ice soul core whenever it got close to it. The spiritual soul core would then have no choice but to gather the torn bits and reabsorb them. Hence, the spiritual soul core was becoming increasingly enraged. How could it sit and wait as someone attempted to snatch its territory?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature in the laboratory started to dip as the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass crept out of Huo Yuhao’s body silently. Its icy blue leaves radiated a gentle glow, which seemed to be dissipating its energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Star Anise Icy Coagulation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was rapidly absorbing the Ultimate Ice aura in the air before it transferred it back into Huo Yuhao’s body. The energy was then passed over to the Snow Empress for her to replenish her expended energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was unable to sense all of this because all of his attention had already been invested in his spiritual soul core.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an unknown amount of time had passed, the intense pain which came from the spiritual soul core’s mindless ravaging pushed Huo Yuhao to his limits once again. His body—which had been nourished and enhanced by the Dragon Pill—was showing signs of tearing up again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Li Ya had already jumped in to help him, she was no longer able to restrain the spiritual soul core, which was practically going insane by now. She could only help to slightly stabilize the energy within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, an icy blue current moved upwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress’ ice crystal had finally moved once again. It was heading upwards again. The Snow Empress’ spiritual aura was as cold and tough as Huo Yuhao’s Sigh of the Snow Goddess. It instantly pierced Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core without any difficulty. It was as if the soul core had a bucket of ice water poured on it, and it paused momentarily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, the ice crystal which was formed by the Snow Empress suddenly exploded to form streaks of energy which gushed towards the rapidly rotating ball of Ultimate Ice soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Empress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao was in an unbelievable amount of pain, he could still sense what the Snow Empress had done for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he did not know what kind of harm the Snow Empress had inflicted upon herself, he was still able to sense her determination to help him at all costs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Empress!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hummmm!" The ball of Ultimate Ice energy which was at his chest started to vibrate with an unprecedented intensity before huge amounts of energy spurted out of it like a geyser.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt his chest contract rapidly as the spiritual power which was swarming towards his chest disintegrated instantly. The pain he had been withstanding also disappeared temporarily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ultimate Ice energy that was released from the ice crystal’s explosion was very pure. It was like ice belts, which latched themselves onto the ball of Ultimate Ice energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead of slowing down, the ball of Ultimate Ice energy was somehow able to rotate faster after the ice belts attached themselves to it. During its rapid rotation, the ball of Ultimate Ice energy was constantly emitting a loud humming sound. &nbsp;The Ultimate Ice energy within the ball was being heavily compressed at an insane speed as a powerful sensation was released from Huo Yuhao’s chest to his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ball of Ultimate Ice energy was actually able to expand itself to ten times its original size in a couple of seconds. Just when it was about to take up Huo Yuhao’s entire chest cavity, it suddenly contracted to its original size, as though it was compressed by a mysterious force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The color of the soul core had also changed along with the series of strange transformations. It had become dark blue. One could also notice a patch of darkness surrounding the crystal clear dark blue ball of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul core? Is this how it’s supposed to look like? At the very least, it looks like a soul core that has begun to take shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was startled by the sight before him. Based on his estimations, he should have required thrice as much as time as it had taken, and an enormous amount of Ultimate Ice energy, to reach the current state of his soul core! However, the Snow Empress’ sudden intervention seemed to have allowed the soul core to directly take shape. The rapid transformation was no longer just awe-inspiring—it was simply miraculous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Empress, what exactly did you do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual soul core launched an attack once again after being temporarily stunned by the Snow Empress’ spiritual shock. This time around, Huo Yuhao was not able to completely block the unparalleled spiritual power that was going straight for the Ultimate Ice soul core, which had just taken shape in Huo Yuhao’s chest. The intense spiritual power fluctuations seemed to illustrate the murderous intent that his spiritual soul core had towards his Ultimate Ice soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao did not sense any pain at this instant. Instead, he felt a mysterious cooling sensation in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when the crazy spiritual power was about to collide with the Ultimate Ice soul core, a powerful intent infused with Ultimate Ice energy suddenly surged out and froze the spiritual power instantly. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it had just frozen the spiritual power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual power can actually be frozen?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was utterly shocked by what he had just witnessed.</span></p>
