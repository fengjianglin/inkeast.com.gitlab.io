 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Let him sleep then. This region is very dark, thus this hotel is safer than the one in the north. Later, just proceed to the location that we’ve decided on. Once I finish things over here, I’ll go over to find you immediately. Don’t act blindly. There’ll be at least a Class 6 or 7 soul engineer over there, as well as several evil soul masters standing guard. If you expose yourself, you can forget about saving your mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu replied without any hesitation, “Okay, I’ll listen to you. I won’t barge in blindly. I’ll wait for you to come. If you don’t come after a day, I’ll…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression turned serious at this moment. “If I still don’t arrive in a day, you must think of a way to leave this place. Don’t think about rescuing anyone anymore. Otherwise, the bloodline of the Earthdragon Sect will never be passed down. Do you think that will be what your mother wants to see?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu’s was moved, and she suddenly hugged Huo Yuhao tightly. “We’ll succeed, won’t we?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t bear to push her away as he felt her body tremble. He gently patted her back, “Yes, we’ll succeed. All of this will be over, and everything will be fine again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks. If you can save my mother and the disciples of the Earthdragon Sect, we’ll do anything for the Tang Sect in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Silly girl. You are a part of the Tang Sect. How can you speak on behalf of the Earthdragon Sect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu relaxed her hug and took two steps back. After this, she wore a displeased expression on her face. “You aren’t even as old as me yet. Don’t always think that you can act like an elder. You’re not even twenty, but you act like you’re forty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An upset look flashed across Huo Yuhao’s eyes. Yes! His mental age was far older than most others of the same age, which was a result of the unfortunate events he had experienced when he was younger, as well as everything that had occurred afterward. It was also because of this that he could play a leading role in the Tang Sect, became the youngest member of the Sea God’s Pavilion in Shrek Academy, and was the first to complete the Ultimate Soldier Plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath and checked everything he had on him before he said resolutely to Nan Qiuqiu, “Let’s go.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Nan Qiuqiu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them quickly left the hotel before they proceeded in two different directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s destination was very close, so he stopped after only walking for a short while. As he made a turn, he silently entered a narrow, dark alley. Even though there were high-altitude surveillance soul tools above him, he couldn’t possibly be detected without the use of thermal detectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the north of the city, He Caitou was standing at a window and watching the sky. It was getting closer and closer to the agreed-upon time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four who had snuck out through the southern city gate were now waiting quietly twenty-five kilometers from this same city gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were simply too many surveillance soul tools in Sunrise City. There were even soul tools stationed outside the city, which prevented them from getting close. They were also waiting for their opportunity to come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was getting darker and darker. The darker it was, the worse the effect of the surveillance soul tools. Of course, such a situation wasn’t going to last for long. Once high-altitude surveillance soul tools were able to be combined with thermal detectors, there would be significant improvements in the aspect of high-altitude surveillance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything was in place, and it was about time too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin!” An instruction suddenly sounded in He Caitou’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A passionate look suddenly flashed across He Caitou’s eyes. He rubbed his right hand across his bald head and turned around immediately. He faced all the soul tools that he had installed in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge ring on his right hand shone, and a dark-red barrel around a meter long with a ten-centimeter caliber appeared in his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took one step forward and was behind the Class 8 egg-shaped soul tool. He pointed the dark-red barrel upward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The structure of this hotel was very simple – there were only several two-storey buildings. They were in a room which was on the second floor of one of the buildings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Red lights rose silently at this point. A huge hole was vaporized in the roof of this room when the red light from the barrel was fired at it. No dust fell from the roof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou became more and more excited. He swept his barrel quickly, and many sections of the roof were disintegrated in a matter of seconds. Very soon, the roof ceased to exist entirely. At this point, the ‘starfishes’ that had helped to conceal the soul power undulations from this room earlier were no longer in effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou quickly retracted the barrel in his hand, and it turned into a disc-like item. At the same time, he stepped on a semi-circular piece of metal that wasn’t very eye-catching below the base of the egg-shaped soul tool. One end of that soul tool immediately cracked open, and a pitch-black barrel slowly extended out. Blinding red light started to shine within this barrel, and the twenty-four Milk Bottles inside the base started to release soul power. The soul power undulations that were generated as a result immediately triggered alarms in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou wore a calm expression on his face, but there was a wild look in his eyes. He moved his right hand rapidly on the disc and kept on pressing it. A soul cannon that was pointed towards the sky started to light up. Following this, fierce gusts of wind started to rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impact caused by the tremendous soul power undulations didn’t just cause the roof to be torn apart. The surrounding walls also collapsed, and close to a hundred streaks of flowing light were targeted and shot towards the sky instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from that egg-shaped soul tool in this room, there were also ten Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons. Each cannon was completely filled with stationary soul cannon shells. In the first wave of attack, one hundred and eighty Class 4 shells were fired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In monetary terms, the cost of all the shells in these ten cannons was enough to cover half a year of Sunrise City’s revenue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunrise City was indeed tightly guarded. When more than a hundred streaks of lights were fired, countless soul rays and soul cannon lights started shining near the closest north wall before they were fired to intercept the streaks of incoming light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the city, the northern legion of soul engineers also started to gather a lot of firepower to intercept the incoming attack. They formed a huge interception net in the air and tried to stop all of the incoming shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things started to get messy inside Sunrise City too. No matter how fast they reacted, the troops in the city would only be able to arrive after fifteen minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou didn’t seem to have seen the changes in the sky. Right now, he had already focused his energy on the egg-shaped soul tool. The scarlet-red light was gradually turning golden-red at the front of this soul tool. The terrifying soul power undulations even caused He Caitou to feel a little breathless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was pressing the other side of this egg-shaped soul tool right now, specifically on a red button with a skull on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rings of demonic patterned lights quickly surged upward from the base of the soul tool. When this entire soul tool turned golden-red, He Caitou pressed this button with force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the surrounding air distorted tremendously, and the high-altitude surveillance soul tools within this region lost their effect. They could only detect distorted waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, a ball of cone-shaped, golden-red light was fired from that barrel, and quickly rose into the sky. In the blink of an eye, it crossed the city wall and was northbound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were people in charge of the high-altitude surveillance soul tools over where the northern legion of soul engineers was.
