 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

She was surprised that Wang Dong’s voice was crisper and even more harmonious than her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, she didn’t persist. Wang Dong’s hands were already moving swiftly, and his ten fingers shone with dim golden light, displaying his great dexterity. He managed to quickly remove all the dirt from Huo Yuhao’s back and stitched up his wounds. Then the bleeding was stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi was silent as she opened the medicinal bottle and scattered the powder on Huo Yuhao’s wounds. There was one thing in common between her and Wang Dong. They were both crying. Wang Dong had to wipe his tears off several times with his sleeves to keep his vision from blurring. However, some of his tears still dripped onto Huo Yuhao’s mangled body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Different scenes played out in their minds. Ju Zi thought of how Huo Yuhao had saved her in the Jing Yang Mountain Ranges, and how he looked when he was grilling meat, whereas Wang Dong recalled how Huo Yuhao had pulled him into his arms just after the Raiment of Light ended. As the two of them crashed to the ground, Huo Yuhao’s eyes were filled with resolve even though he was in pain. He did his best to prevent them from switching positions, bearing the brunt of the attack himself with his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The war had ended, the rebel troops were exterminated. The empire’s army completed the encirclement, with the mountain that Huo Yuhao and the rest were on at the center. Right now, the soul engineers remained standing even though they were all extremely fatigued. None of them sat down to rest. They all looked in Huo Yuhao’s direction, who was pale and unconscious on the ground. They were watching Wang Dong as he treated Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them knew that they would have died on the battlefield if not for the two of them. They were their benefactors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong and Ju Zi finally completed their treatment of Huo Yuhao. They looked into each other’s eyes and saw relief within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi moved over to, and squatted down beside, Wang Dong. She whispered something in his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s body stiffened up, and he twisted his head to look at Ju Zi. Finally, he nodded his head determinedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi shut her eyes and took in a deep breath. She said, “I know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong didn’t look at her again, but lifted Huo Yuhao’s arms onto his shoulders before carefully lifting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao regained consciousness, he discovered that he was in a huge tent. He was in a prone position. Then he saw a handsome sleeping face with tear stains beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense, prickling pain could be felt on his back, causing Huo Yuhao to recall everything that had happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He revealed a self-deprecating smile on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who did my back offend? Why is it always the thing that gets hurt? It seems like I’ll have to create something to protect my back the next time I create soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shut his eyes, and the battle that had ensued earlier replayed itself in his mind. As he recalled what had happened, he soon realized that something went wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were very fortunate to have won. After the Goddess of Light struck, they were out of fighting strength. They were only able to win because Zhao Yang wasn’t familiar with them. Their martial soul fusion skill and soul skills played very important roles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they could have won easily. That was because Huo Yuhao was also a Class 6 soul engineer, in addition to being a soul master! However, he forgot about his identity as a soul engineer when he teamed up with Wang Dong in that battle. He made a huge mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like I’m still a soul master at heart!” Huo Yuhao sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also realized his lack of abilities compared to an advanced-level soul master. Huo Yuhao had always believed that he could challenge a seven-ringed Soul Sage if he could beat a six-ringed Soul Emperor. However, this battle was a huge blow to him. He knew he’d been arrogant as of late because he was too used to winning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, he had beaten many five-ringed and six-ringed soul masters in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. However, they were soul engineers, and not soul masters. Soul engineers were indeed explosive and destructive. However, Teacher Wang Yan’s words were the most accurate. In the future, the strongest soul masters would be equipped with the best soul tools. That was the only way he could truly become strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Academy had also realized this point. That was why Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen had appeared. The higher-level opponents he had beaten were either soul engineers or soul masters. In reality, he was a combination of soul master and soul engineer, which gave him an advantage. To put it into perspective, would he able to defeat his eldest and third senior if they were equipped with the best soul tools?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m only a Soul Ancestor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao repeated these words three times in his mind. The arrogance that was flaming in his mind disappeared. He also started to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was important for one to balance their psychological mindset. This was especially important for those constantly under pressure. In this he did well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was grateful towards Elder Yi. If he hadn’t allowed him to keep the Ominous Soul-Devouring Knife, enabling him to exhibit the Life Guardian’s Blade and fuse with the immense power of the Life Gold, he would have been stripped of his skin several times over, even if he didn’t die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His injuries weren’t as serious now compared to the other time, but they weren’t light either. Huo Yuhao had borne most of the impact from Zhao Yang’s Darkgolden Terrorpalm, hurting his internal organs. The final crash had also inflicted some pretty serious injuries. It had been some time after the battle ended, and he still felt intense pain in his back. However, his passageways and internal organs were healing well. This was the effect of his immense life power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He extended one hand and touched Wang Dong’s hand. Huo Yuhao slowly initiated his soul power and poured it into Wang Dong’s body. Wang Dong’s body jerked slightly as their Haodong Power circulated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, are you awake?” Wang Dong lifted his head, but he was still a little hazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao twisted his head to look at him, “I can’t sleep forever, now can I? Did you cry?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” Wang Dong was completely awake now, and replied loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed, “Alright, alright, of course you didn’t. You’re a man though. A man can bleed but not cry. Don’t cry so much in the future. Don’t you know that I am stubborn? How can I be killed off so easily?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong rolled his eyes at him, “You’re already in this state. What’s there to brag about? How are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “Of course I’m suffering.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong revealed a look of heartache. “Why were you so foolish to bear the attack by yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled, “I couldn’t let you bear this pain. Look at your tender and delicate skin. Mine’s all old and thick compared to your skin. Don’t worry, I’m fine. But you look quite fatigued. Let’s circulate our power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Wang Dong nodded and initiated the Haodong Power to complement Huo Yuhao’s circulating soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “You’re a little too weird like this. Get up.” As he spoke, he shifted a little to the side. However, he accidentally strained the wounds on his back, and was suddenly struck by immense pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t move. I can do it myself.” Wang Dong stopped him. He didn’t think too much, and laid beside Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao was prone and his head was to one side. Wang Dong had no choice but to lie on his side since this place was narrow. He grabbed onto Huo Yuhao’s hands and initiated his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao suddenly laughed.</span></p>
