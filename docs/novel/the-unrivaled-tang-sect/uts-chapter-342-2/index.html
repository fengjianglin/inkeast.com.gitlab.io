If this material life energy isn’t guided, it will dissipate into the air. My Golden Dragon Spear possesses similar characteristics, and it can absorb living beings’ life energy, but it cannot keep that energy within itself. The spear can only direct all that life energy into humans. From the opposite perspective, I can use my Golden Dragon Spear to absorb life energy and feed it into your Life Gold. Their existences can be said to be symbiotic and complementary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao only realized that he didn’t know the value of what he possessed after listening to Wang Qiu’er’s explanation. Not even his teacher, Electrolux, knew about what Wang Qiu’er had just said. The academy didn’t have any record of such esoteric information, yet Wang Qiu’er knew this. Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but feel a lot more curious about her identity and where she came from!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they were talking, metal powder and tiny fragments began to drift away from the gate in front of them. Wang Qiu’er continued to channel her Golden Dragon Spear and the Life Guardian Blade, and the spear continued to absorb while the knife’s Adjudication ability seemed to be activated at its highest possible level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said no more. Instead, he raised his Spiritual Detection to the highest possible level as he perceived everything around him. He would inform his companions as soon as he discovered something amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adjudication destroyed a metal’s empirical characteristics. This large gate was at least a meter thick, and made from seven or eight different alloys. If a soul master wanted to use brute force against this gate, even an eight-ringed Soul Douluo might not be able to break through. In addition, brute force would cause the place to shake and tremble, and that would trigger all the soul tools set up around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Adjudication could directly absorb a metal’s life energy and cause it to crumble. The designers who built this warehouse could never have anticipated such a thing, and even if all the Class 9 soul engineers in the Soul Moon Empire were concentrated in this place, they probably wouldn’t have considered this possibility, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How much more, Qiu’er?” Wang Dong’er couldn’t help but ask. She was afraid that Huo Yuhao’s spiritual avatar had been separated from his main body for a little too long, and problems could arise. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao was participating in the soul engineer tournament on the other side. He had brought his Life Guardian Blade to this place, so what carving knife was he using over there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er answered, “This gate is very thick, and its metals are also exceptionally tough. You can tell from how strong the life energy that I have absorbed is. I need at least ten more minutes before I can break it down entirely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally guessed Wang Dong’er’s worries and attempted to comfort her. “Don’t worry, there’s more than enough time. However, you have to be prepared! I suspect that there will be people guarding the second level, and they cannot possibly be weak. There must a Class 7 soul engineer at the very least. Dong’er, Qiu’er, Xiao Xiao... the three of you have to coordinate at full strength so that you can defeat and kill your opponent as quickly as possible. Afterwards, we can attempt to break into the third level, as I believe that’s where the most invaluable and precious metals are kept. Most of the strongest guardians have left, and the third warehouse is also the deepest region, which means it’s far less likely that somebody will be standing guard there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er understood that his reminders didn’t seem to include Xiao Xiao. The two girls exchanged a look and nodded slightly. Tthis was crunch time for everyone, and the two girls had to temporarily set aside their differences if they wanted things to work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">--------</span></p>

After working for more than an hour, every soul engineer pretty much had a prototype of their soul tool... with the exception of one person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Starsky Douluo, Ye Yulin, had spent more than fifty percent of his time watching the youth in the wheelchair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else’s soul tools were starting to take shape. At least, they had completed between one to two formation arrays, while this youth was still working on those delicate components.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That cannot possibly be a human-shaped soul tool! It’s impossible that he possesses such strength, and even if he does, a Class 9 soul engineer will take from half a month to one month to complete more than one hundred formation arrays! Furthermore, human-shaped soul tools take very long to test and troubleshoot. One such soul tool cannot be completed without spending several months on it. What’s this youngster doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin wouldn’t be so focused on Huo Yuhao if the only thing about him was that he couldn’t understand what this youngster was doing. Ye Yulin scrutinized him so much mainly because of the speed at which Huo Yuhao was crafting those components, and how his hands were moving like clouds and flowing water. At this moment, there were many different components strewn around and beneath the crafting desk. It felt as if he wasn’t going to stop making components. Two hours were about to pass, and Huo Yuhao didn’t seem like he was about to take a break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ll wait and see what he can do,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had his own hidden troubles. Because of his separated spiritual avatar, he seemed like he was moving very quickly, but there was nothing more he could do beyond these components that weren’t considered too exquisite. Furthermore, he didn’t have his Life Guardian Blade, and that meant he couldn’t complete his soul tool’s important parts at all, let alone his formation arrays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had to switch his spiritual power over to the other side again and again throughout the crafting process. He focused more on his crafting process when Wang Qiu’er was using his Life Guardian Blade to open the large gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mysterious and masked vice-founder had arrived inside the resting area beneath the competition stage. Just as Nangong Wan had said, the vice-founder brought along several other powerful individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could see the waves of radiant light and deafening booms that were coming from the sky in the city. However, the three underground organizations went on with their business as if nothing was happening, and they informed the audience that they were just fireworks. The Holy Ghost Church’s vice-founder had no help over there, and one could tell from this that the Holy Ghost Church was very confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems like the operation on the other side is bound to fail. I wonder what strength the Holy Ghost Church is relying upon to resist this multi-pronged assault and pressure from Shrek Academy, the Star Luo Empire, and the Body Sect? Are they just banking on the Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao, and several evil Titled Douluo? They must be far outnumbered. Even if Elder Xuan and Du Busi cannot defeat Long Xiaoyao, they are both Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo, and they should have no problem keeping Long Xiaoyao occupied. Furthermore, they’re inside Radiant City. Even if those Class 9 soul engineers have the strength to threaten those Titled Douluo, will they dare to use those powerful soul tools? They will be in big trouble if they accidentally damage the Royal Palace or anything else within the city...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s thoughts continued spinning in his head. His spiritual power was extremely powerful, but he still felt a throbbing headache. He hurriedly withdrew his wandering thoughts and concentrated on crafting his soul tool, and didn’t dare to be distracted anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems like there’s nothing I can do about the operation over at the Royal Palace. I can only make sure that I complete my own two operations as best I can. The Sun Moon Empire looks like they are prepared... I just hope Elder Xuan and the others will be fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t that worried about Elder Xuan and the other people from Shrek Academy. Why did Zhang Lexuan agree to the two princesses’ request? It was part of his plan from the beginning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan had gone to see Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao before she met the two princesses, and she actually met Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao with Elder Xuan beside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy came up with their plan after careful discussion. If they were prepared, and if Elder Xuan was leading the group, it was almost impossible for the Sun Moon Empire to keep them here if they wanted to. Not even an Ultimate Douluo could accomplish that. They were inside Radiant City after all, and the Sun Moon Empire had to guard against these top-tier individuals from fighting for their lives and causing collateral damage. If a group of Transcendent Douluo and Titled Douluo went wild, Radiant City would be in tatters, if it wasn’t just flattened entirely in the process. That wasn’t something that Xu Tianran wanted to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao settled down, and didn’t dare to slow his crafting speed at all. Every single component and how they had to be made was firmly in his mind, and all he had to do was craft them as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he didn’t have his Life Guardian Blade, Huo Yuhao was using another high-quality carving knife. Metal dust and particles flew all over the place on his crafting desk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power quickly showed the way while the gate was still falling down. &nbsp;</span></p>
