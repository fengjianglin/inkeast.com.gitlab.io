As his figure flashed, he disappeared into the air. At this point, he wasn’t standing beside Wang Dong’er. However, he had already shared his plan with everyone. He was going to stop the three brothers and take the two cubs away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er quickly followed him. Huo Yuhao was the most important to her. Furthermore, their abilities were greatly enhanced when they were together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was also at this moment that the male bear’s attack arrived. His sharp, bloody claws descended from the sky, and his terrifying aura swept over everyone. The thick, bloody smell was nauseating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was about to advance, but she sensed the lethal threat and had no choice but to stop. Her wings beat, and she retreated quickly. At this point, Huo Yuhao had disappeared. Even his Spiritual Detection had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last information Wang Dong’er received from him was to stay where she was to help the rest and not to follow him. He wanted to use a special method to deal with the three brothers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Huo Yuhao was credible, Wang Dong’er was still a little frantic at this point. However, the male bear’s attack was like a dancing, bloody cyclone as it swept towards everyone. Wang Dong’er was also one of its targets, and she couldn’t escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only one who had moved away from the team. As Huo Yuhao moved, someone else also moved. As her slender figure flashed, she turned into a golden light projection that was faded into the forest. She moved in the same direction as Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strength of the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear was explosive. Even though this ten-thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear was only left with his spirit, his fighting style didn’t change at all. His terrifying fighting strength erupted and suppressed everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Cai Mei’er’s cultivation, it wasn’t difficult for her to escape. However, she needed to protect her students! This was especially true for students like Mo Xuan, who didn’t possess any real fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

He knew that the two bears couldn’t kill them with Dean Cai around. What he had to do now was turn the situation around. It was only this way that his friends could escape from danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why didn’t he drag Wang Dong’er along? That was because he wasn’t confident. Even with Wang Dong’er, could he possibly challenge three Soul Douluo? He decided to act alone because he would be completely disregarding any danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he burst forward, his third eye opened. His soul thrusters and Spiritual Detection were also initiated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, he heard a sonorous dragon’s roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was very unexpected, but it was filled with rage. Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection covered a large area. He immediately turned his head in the direction of the roar. He was appalled to discover that Wang Qiu’er had also separated from the team. Furthermore, her target was the female bear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not good!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Wang Qiu’er had demonstrated great abilities, Huo Yuhao didn’t believe that she could fight a ten-thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear by herself. Even Elder Xuan had once mentioned how strong a ten-thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear was. At the ten-thousand year level, it was one of the best among the savage beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was too late for Huo Yuhao to help Wang Qiu’er at this point. Furthermore, could he even do anything with his current strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was time to make a decision. Huo Yuhao grit his teeth, and a huge cannon barrel was lifted onto his shoulder. This cannon was dark blue, and there were countless rose patterns on its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Ke Ke were here, she would definitely recognize it as a Giant Lightning Cannon. However, Huo Yuhao’s cannon was covered by a mysterious glow. Whether it was the size or the number of formation arrays, Ke Ke’s cannon couldn’t compare to this one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a Giant Lightning Cannon, but it was also a Class 7 heavy cannon called the Lightning God’s Fury. He Caitou was the one who had developed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before they set off on this journey, Huo Yuhao had naturally told his partners where he was going. He Caitou passed his Lightning God’s Fury to him, and also gave him three compatible stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this heavy cannon was different from the one He Caitou had used previously. He Caitou had never used a stationary soul cannon before. This modified Class 7 cannon possessed the strongest offensive strength among all the soul tools that He Caitou possessed. That was why he passed it to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense bolts of lightning were unleashed, and the Lightning God’s Fury revealed layers and layers of bluish-purple halos. Huo Yuhao’s speed didn’t decrease as he burst forward, but his charging of the cannon persisted. The strongest aspect of a stationary soul cannon was that its might didn’t lie in the cannon itself, but the cannon shell. Firing the cannon didn’t expend a lot of soul power. Although it was costly to make, it was undoubtedly more terrifying than a soul cannon that was fired purely using soul power. Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to waste his soul power, and thus he chose this cannon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumbling sounds rolled forth, and Huo Yuhao flew back due to the recoil, knocking into two huge trees. A bolt of bluish-purple lightning flashed in the air before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did Huo Yuhao charge his cannon while bursting forward earlier? He was flung back to where he wanted to go. He exploited the burst of speed brought about by this recoil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even bother with the female bear and Wang Qiu’er, who were both on the other side. He did whatever he needed to the best of his abilities</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was aware that this cannon couldn’t possibly kill the female bear, but it could at least stall her, given the strength of a Class 7 stationary soul cannon shell. Wang Qiu’er would then be afforded time to escape… At the same time, stalling the female bear would be very helpful for his side. Dealing with the male bear’s spirit and preventing both bears from teaming up together was the key to resolving the problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao burst forward after he did what he needed to do. The light from his Eye of Destiny shone brightly, and layers of distorted ripples started to appear on his body. He instantly disappeared into the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er wasn’t slower than Huo Yuhao. Suddenly, an indescribable feeling caused her to stop. At this point, she already saw the hysterical female bear rushing over. In the next instant, she saw something unforgettable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of intense, bluish-purple light swept by. It was so bright that the entire forest turned bluish-purple. All the plants and trees were illuminated with the same color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, the female bear was swallowed by the bluish-purple light. The terrifying lightning was changed into a shocking beam of light that shot into the sky. Rumbling thunder echoed in three waves, and the immense impact swept the entire area that the bluish-purple light had covered earlier. &nbsp;All the plants and trees were turned into ash by the terrifying impact and destructive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er crossed her arms in front of her body, and a layer of thick golden light emanated from her body. However, her body was still flung backward by the force. She flew close to hundred meters before she managed to stabilize her body. However, an intense numbness was running through her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, this was how terrifying a Class 7 stationary soul cannon was. Everything in front of Wang Qiu’er had turned to ash. The female bear was smashed down, and her dark-golden hide had turned charcoal black. Gusts of thick smoke rose from her fur as she collapsed to the ground in pain, lightning crackling around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the Sun Moon Empire, which possessed the strongest soul tools, classified stationary soul cannons that were at Class 7 as weapons of mass destruction. They couldn’t be sold. No one knew how many Class 7 stationary soul cannons the Sun Moon Empire possessed, but they had already become the biggest threat to the rest of the empires on the continent because of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cannon shell that Huo Yuhao just fired was worth eight hundred thousand gold soul coins. That wasn’t even including the time that He Caitou had spent on developing it. If it were auctioned off, the cannon would be worth more than three million gold soul coins. What if was fired towards an elite team of soldiers? Everything in a three hundred meter radius would be turned to ash. Any soul master below a six-ringed cultivation could forget about escaping. How many people possessed strength as immense as Wang Qiu’er? That was the reason why Huo Yuhao had dared to fire that cannon shell!</span></p>
