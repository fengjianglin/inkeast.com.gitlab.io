 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen twisted his lips and said, “How am I not being kind? At least I’m not hiding and withholding anything. I’ve imparted everything that I know to you. Otherwise, how could you have become a Class 9 soul engineer?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, Huo Yuhao was a true Class 9 soul engineer now. Even though he was not a Titled Douluo yet, he had completed the production of a Class 9 soul tool. This was unquestionable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao understood what Xuan Ziwen was saying. “Teacher Xuan, it’s not that I’m not teaching you. It’s that you aren’t understanding.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen snapped, “That’s because I don’t have the Ghostcarving Blade!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a year and a half, but Xuan Ziwen and He Caitou still didn’t manage to learn the Rain Dragon’s Dance. They had only learned very minor parts of it. Their comprehension wasn’t deep enough, which meant that the strength of the Rain Dragon’s Dance couldn’t be fully unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can’t blame me for that!” Huo Yuhao said helplessly, “This Ghostcarving Blade has picked its owner. I have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he could become a Class 9 soul engineer so quickly was because he had the Ghostcarving Blade and knew the Rain Dragon’s Dance. The more he used and understood them, the more he understood the mysteries of the Rain Dragon’s Dance. He had learned a lot. This was the same for his self-created soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, when can we start?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen said, “No rush. I’ll conceptualize it first. Since you’re almost done with the outer shell, I’ll design a plan for this core part. Then we’ll discuss where to go from there. There’s no rush to take action. Given your current abilities, there should be no problem producing it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen appeared pensive. “In fact, I’ve been thinking of how to make more extensive use of this model. If it works out, I believe we can change the entire world of soul tools!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “How is it so easy? Haven’t we already conceptualized it? We wanted to produce a spiritual energy amplifier to amplify spiritual energy, but it’s too difficult. First, we don’t know how to start. Secondly, who’s going to test it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen also laughed bitterly, “You’re right. There’s no way of testing this thing. Furthermore, we can’t make any headway. Let’s take things slow. Let’s finish whatever you have first. Once we finish it, we can stun the world of soul engineers. When that happens, hehe…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a bald head poked through the door from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen glanced up, and snapped, “What are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou walked in from outside and chuckled, “I was afraid of disturbing the both of you.” He was now an official Class 8 soul engineer too, since his soul power cultivation had reached eight rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a food-type soul master, it was very difficult to increase his cultivation. The Qiankun Fortune Pill was the most effective on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou sat in a chair and said, “Yuhao, can you make a trip to the academy? I heard Elder Xuan and the others have ended their retreat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing He Caitou’s words, Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan has exited his cultivation? That’s great!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Tang Sect gave one Qiankun Fortune Pill to Shrek Academy, Elder Xuan went into closed-door cultivation with Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er. This was also decided after a conference in the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why only the three of them took the pill instead of the rest of the elders was because the future of the academy was taken into consideration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The effect of the Qiankun Fortune Pill was indeed miraculous, but there were still limits. In addition, the condition of the person consuming the pill had to be taken into consideration too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a six-ringed or seven-ringed soul master, the effect would be much greater. However, for a Titled Douluo, the effect was much less pronounced. This was especially so for these Titled Douluo from Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Elder Xuan, Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er were chosen to consume the pill after much consideration. Elder Xuan was an obvious candidate because he was the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion and a Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo. He had the most hope of becoming an Ultimate Douluo. What Shrek Academy lacked most right now was an Ultimate Douluo. As for Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er, they were considered some of the younger ones in the Sea God’s Pavilion. However, they were already Transcendent Douluo. They had the greatest potential for improving further. Yan Shaozhe was already a Rank 96 Titled Douluo. Xian Lin’er was also a Rank 95 Titled Douluo. They were going to be the future pillars of Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, the three of them went into closed-door cultivation together and consumed the Qiankun Fortune Pill to break through their bottlenecks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the elders of Shrek Academy didn’t expect them to be in closed-door cultivation for so long. They went into cultivation for one and-a-half years. How could Huo Yuhao not be surprised when He Caitou said that they had exited their retreat? He was most concerned about whether Elder Xuan had made a breakthrough and became another Ultimate Douluo after Elder Mu. If he was successful, it would be very beneficial for the academy and the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, I’ll go and take a look.” Huo Yuhao looked at Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen nodded at him and said, “You can go. You don’t have to come over the next few days. I believe that I’ll need ten to fifteen days for my initial design. You can return after half a month.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was officially a Class 9 soul engineer now. It also seemed like he was going to become better than Xuan Ziwen too. Hence, Xuan Ziwen was less strict on him. In terms of designing soul tools, Xuan Ziwen was much more experienced. Furthermore, designing soul tools was very time-consuming. Huo Yuhao’s cultivation was rising very quickly. Furthermore, he was also very young, and his potential was unlimited. Seeing that Huo Yuhao was already a Class 9 soul engineer, Xuan Ziwen offered him much more freedom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao was delighted. He finally had time to rest. The amount of energy he drained everyday from researching soul tools was much more than the amount of energy he drained from cultivating. Even though it was only six hours, his brain was operating at very high levels! He was extremely tired every day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After exiting the laboratory, Huo Yuhao asked He Caitou, “Second senior, did the academy call anyone else apart from me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou chortled and said, “Alright, let’s quickly find Wutong and bring her along. He called for eldest senior, you and Wutong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little embarrassed as he laughed. He Caitou immediately knew what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was just preparing to begin her meditation when Huo Yuhao returned. She was a little surprised, and quickly changed when she heard that the academy was calling her. After that, she went to the academy with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After exiting the Tang Sect, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt as if his entire body had relaxed. He had not been out for a long time. It wasn’t just him. Tang Wutong had the same feeling too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been close to two years since the two of them had reconciled with each other, and begun cultivating together, but the number of times they had left the Tang Sect in that time could be counted on one hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, they entered the inner city of Shrek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City had been through enormous changes over the past few years. On the surface, the outer city didn’t look too different from the inner city. The only difference was that the exterior of the outer city appeared to be much more modern than the inner city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The headquarters of the Spirit Pagoda was now in the outer city. This also brought Shrek City closer to the center of the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. Many soul masters came to Shrek City. The number of businessmen was even greater, and most of them came from the original Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Heavenly Soul Empire was occupied by the Sun Moon Empire, these businessmen feared for their safety. For those who could, they chose to migrate. Naturally, Shrek City was their choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City was protected by Shrek Academy. It was a city that had even resisted the strength of a beast wave from the Great Star Dou Forest! It was definitely much safer than any empire on the original Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, Shrek City became much more vibrant. In just a few years, the city was now a concrete jungle. Furthermore, Shrek Academy had also learned from the strengths of the Sun Moon Empire, installing many soul tools in the new city. This earned the approval of many of the new migrants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Widespread use of soul tools brought convenience. In the areas that the Sun Moon Empire occupied, some of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s citizens were still resisting the Sun Moon Empire. However, no such problem existed in Shrek City. Everyone only had good words for Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The changes to Shrek City have been immense!” Tang Wutong was in awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Yes! Right now, the scale of Shrek City is comparable to the Sun Moon Empire. Apart from the fact that we still need to work on our soul tools, the scale and popularity of the city is indeed comparable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong smiled and said, “Yes! I’m starting to like Shrek more and more.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My dear, you’re already a Titled Douluo. We’re not young anymore. Should we invite your family over and discuss our marriage?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, “Of course not. I’m only trying to settle this matter as soon as possible. I can’t just wait forever! I’ve already been battered by your seal countless times. I’m starting to become traumatized!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong thought about how pathetic he was, she chortled and said, “Don’t rush. I’ll find a way to contact my father.” When she mentioned her father, a worried look flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
