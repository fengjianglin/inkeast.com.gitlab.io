Of course! Of course!” Bei Bei confirmed his decision thrice. “Yuhao, do you know what Mo Xuan’s nickname in the inner courtyard is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head. However, he could make a rough guess, especially after Bei Bei pointed out that Mo Xuan could enter the Sea God’s Pavilion in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said, “His nickname was given to him by Dean Yan. He’s called the War Controller.”</span></p>

I’ve been enhanced by his Halo before. To be honest, its effect isn’t that great.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei laughed coldly and said, “For soul masters of our standards, his enhancement isn’t that great. However, have you ever considered the cumulative effect if thousands of soul masters were enhanced at the same time? The overall strength of an entire army can soar instantly. Whether it’s in terms of speed, strength, or defense, they’ll all be greatly enhanced. If abilities like Bloodlust were used to supplement it further, can you imagine how a battle will turn out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned. “What? His Halo can enhance thousands of people at the same time? That is so unreal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei replied firmly, “It’s so strong precisely because it’s unreal.” He explained what he knew about Mo Xuan’s Halo to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mo Xuan’s abilities are a secret even in the inner courtyard. I heard about them from my grandfather. Even he was very impressed with Mo Xuan’s abilities, and decided that Xuan should join the Sea God’s Pavilion in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Bei Bei mentioned Elder Mu, Huo Yuhao was even more astonished. For Elder Mu to be impressed, Mo Xuan’s Halo must be very strong indeed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said, “Let’s go, let’s not make him wait. Heaven is really helping us!”</span></p>

In fact, it was even much simpler, as Bei Bei was worried about delaying Mo Xuan’s admission into the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m willing to join the Tang Sect and observe the rules of the sect. The sect’s glory will be my glory, and the sect’s humiliation will be my humiliation. I’m willing to use my life to protect the sect. If I violate any of its rules, let me die a horrible death.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei opened his arms wide open and gave Mo Xuan a big hug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Mo Xuan hugged him back, he smiled. “Bei Bei, I should call you eldest senior in the future too.” In terms of age, he wasn’t much older than Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei laughed. “You won’t have to call me soon. You are also an official disciple. You can call me by my name. Yuhao, don’t hide your all-terrain self-driving fort anymore. Teach Mo Xuan after you return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed. “I’ll do that. However, I want to sleep first. I spent the entire night discussing soul tools with Teacher Xuan. He has gone to meditate, and I’m extremely exhausted now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan smiled and said, “No rush, no rush. We can talk about it after we return to the inner courtyard. You can tell me if the Tang Sect needs any help. After all, I’m now a part of the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei retrieved a script and said, “Mo Xuan, this script records some of our Tang Sect abilities. You can start practicing them. I know that you don’t have any offensive soul skills. However, our Tang Sect techniques are not much inferior to soul skills if you practice them well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan received the copied script and looked at it. There were only four huge words on it, “Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Mysterious Heaven Treasure Record without the Hidden Weapon Hundred Separation, but it recorded the cultivation methods of the other Tang Sect Secret Techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said seriously, “Memorize it before returning it to me. These are our secret techniques. Without our approval, you cannot spread them to anyone else. Otherwise, we’ll have to take back your powers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan turned serious too. “I know. Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After sending Mo Xuan off, Huo Yuhao heard something loud resonating from the Sparring Arena. There seemed to be someone cheering loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eldest senior, who’s at the Sparring Arena?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei replied, “Caitou and Xiao Xiao. Nannan has lessons today and returned to the inner courtyard before daybreak. Sanshi didn’t leave, and Dong’er is around too. They’re also likely to be there. Let’s go and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “I was looking for Dong’er too.” Although he was exhausted from staying up the entire night, he wouldn’t go to sleep immediately. He needed to meditate to recover first. Cultivating with Wang Dong’er was naturally going to make his restoration faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After discussing things with Xuan Ziwen last night, Huo Yuhao felt that the burden on his shoulders had been lightened. Just like Xuan Ziwen had said, he couldn’t reach the peaks of both a soul master and soul engineer. He didn’t need to become a powerful soul engineer, he just needed to be a soul master who used soul tools. At least in the aspect of soul tools, Huo Yuhao knew that it was an unknown whether he could surpass Xuan Ziwen even if he gave his all to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was difficult to make such a choice, but he didn’t need to ponder any further once he made it. He could put more of his energy into cultivating his twin martial souls and researching Spirits. Along with Xuan Ziwen’s various experiments, this was the more meaningful and valuable choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao felt the undulations of soul power the moment they entered the Sparring Arena. They saw that it was surrounded by Tang Sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After years of development, the Tang Sect was no longer as sparse as before. Besides Shrek’s Seven Monsters, there was still Na Na and the young soul engineers that came with her. Bei Bei had also recruited some graduates from the outer courtyard. Of course, there were disciples from the inner courtyard, too. Mo Xuan was a good example.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides these official disciples, there were still some students and disciples in name that had come from Shrek City. They mainly cultivated and helped in the development of soul tools. The structure of the entire Tang Sect was becoming more and more complete. All of this was mainly settled by Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi. They weren’t just strong in their cultivations; they were also very talented in management! Along with Shrek Academy’s secret support, the Tang Sect’s development was proceeding quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They also had their own source of income after they sold some secretly-developed soul tools. After some experiments, Shrek Academy also affirmed the utility of the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannon designed by Huo Yuhao and He Caitou. The demand for the cannon thus soared greatly, giving a healthy financial boost to their development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Ziwen’s arrival was also bound to greatly improve the Tang Sect. Xuan Ziwen told Huo Yuhao last night that he could start using his Sealed Milk Bottle. Although he left the method of developing the Sealed Milk Bottle with the Illustrious Virtue Hall, he was the only one who really understood its true meaning. The night wasn’t wasted, as Xuan Ziwen and Huo Yuhao confirmed the plan that they could combine the Sealed Milk Bottle and Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once this plan was realized, the cannon would become the strongest soul tool that could be used by an ordinary person. Even though it could only be fired a limited number of times, it could still be used for a long period of time as long as there were enough Milk Bottles to charge it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What better place was there for them than Shrek Academy to charge these Milk Bottles? There were many strong soul masters in the academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao and Xuan Ziwen made their calculations, they concluded that Class 4 Sealed Milk Bottles had the best value, mostly because Class 5 and above Sealed Milk Bottles required costly, rare metals. Class 4 Sealed Milk Bottles required cheaper, more standard materials. One Class 4 Sealed Milk Bottle would power five shots of the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannon. Of course, the prerequisite was that the cannon shell couldn’t be above Class 3. However, this was already enough!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were different classes of the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannon, too. Consideration of this also led to the formation of problems. The most ordinary cannons could only fire up to a distance of one kilometer, and only used Class 3 and below stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>

As for advanced-level cannons, they could fire Class 7 and below stationary soul cannon shells. Of course, these cannons were also at least Class 7.</span></p>

They weren’t considering advanced-level cannons yet. After all, the cost of developing such cannons was too high. Furthermore, their cannons could fire anywhere from six to eighteen cannon shells at once. Although the cost of such cannons wasn’t low, they were acceptable to most ordinary sects. The cost was even less of a concern for Shrek Academy. However, the stationary soul cannon shells could only be used once. They were expended the moment they were fired, and needed to be replenished. Even if they were replenished by Class 3 stationary soul cannon shells, firing eighteen shells at one go was equivalent to spending three thousand gold coins!</span></p>

If the supply of cannon shells couldn’t match the demand, what was the use of these cannons?</span></p>

There were many things that caught his eye and aroused his curiosity. However, Xuan Ziwen realized that there were many things that he wanted to do after discussing things all night.</span></p>

There were two reasons. First, the completion of the cannon would undoubtedly profit the Tang Sect greatly. Secondly, with more money, they could invest more in their future research funds!</span></p>
