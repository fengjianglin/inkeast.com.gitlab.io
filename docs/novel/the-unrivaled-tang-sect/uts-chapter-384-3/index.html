 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiao Hong, you’re too sensitive. It could just be a cat or mouse. Why’re you so suspicious of such a little noise? This courtyard’s going to turn toxic from your Corrosive Poison Ball.” The person speaking was a relatively short evil master who had an ash-grey face and a set of wide nostrils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humph!” Xiao Hong made a gesture with his fingers, and his triangular eyes darted around. As he snorted disdainfully, he even revealed two buck teeth.</span></p>

Didn’t the Third Elder praise me for how agile I was last time? Killing someone innocent is fine, but we can’t let a guilty person off. Who cares if it’s a mouse or cat? Mao Mao, you can’t be this casual, either. If the Third Elder knew about this, you’d be whipped again.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t make a move, as she was waiting for Huo Yuhao’s signal. The evil soul masters in the room could threaten her mother’s life, but the two outside were only four-ringed Soul Ancestors, which wasn’t something that could threaten her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already entered the room when the two evil Soul Ancestors had rushed out from the veranda. He simply didn’t have any fear of being discovered due to his Imitation.</span></p>

He couldn’t give them the opportunity to kill her, and thus not only did he have to be careful, but he had to move like lightning once he made a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After noiselessly arriving outside the room the two evil soul masters were in, the air around Huo Yuhao’s body twisted slightly as he released a gem-white soul ring. He had activated his Spiritual Interference Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two evil soul masters in the room were currently drinking wine. Although there were only two of them, a large array of dishes were placed on the table in front of them, and they were drinking merrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eeh, I say brother, why do you have two heads?”</span></p>

You’ve drank too much, you. Why are you so weak today? Use your soul power to flush out the alcohol.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bullshit! What’s the point of drinking if I do that? I’ll have a nice sleep later after getting a bit dizzy. Recently, I’ve reached a bottleneck in my soul power, and I can’t increase it anymore. It seems like I’ll have to kill a few more people and eat their hearts to increase my blood qi.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How disgusting. What’s nice about a human heart? Human brains are the best. That soft and sticky taste, tsk tsk tsk…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

That was because the person sitting in front of him suddenly had his head blown off. The soft and sticky brains splattered everywhere, and the brain juices that landed on him actually had that ever-familiar flavor he remembered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used his finger to touch some of the brain juice that had landed on his face, then tasted it. “It seems like I’ve drunk too much. Why does the brain juice in my dream taste so real? Haha, it’s really delicious! I’m dreaming about eating a brain while drinking alcohol. Not bad, not bad. Eeh, why is it so cold?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hand that held a diamond-shaped crystal of ice landed on his neck. Right after that, this Soul King-ranked evil soul master followed his companion into death with a gentle&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">crack</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.</span></p>

It was also why this brain-eating person thought that it was only a dream when the person sitting in front of him had his head blown apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that had been real. Death was the only result for an evil Soul King who didn’t specialize in spiritual force when facing the Eye of Destiny-enhanced Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for this other person, he was even drunk while Huo Yuhao’s Domain of Perpetual Ice was taking effect! His neck was directly crushed by the Ice Empress’ Pincer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Huo Yuhao was making a move, he gestured mentally at Nan Qiuqiu, who then used the power of Annihilation to devastate everything in front of her. Within a few breaths, she had already charged right into the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, what about my mom?” Nan Qiuqiu quickly walked over to Huo Yuhao, not even bothering to spare a glance at the corpses of the two evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t utter a word. He walked over to the table they had been drinking at on, then tapped the ground with his right leg. With a crunch, a slab broke apart, revealing a pitch-black hole that had faint air currents flowing out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your mom’s down there. Go rescue her. You’ll have to be quick though. I’ll be waiting for you outside.” With that, he turned around and went outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu couldn’t be bothered to care about Huo Yuhao’s somewhat strange expression. Without hesitation, she jumped into the basement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although there were air currents coming from the basement, Nan Qiuqiu was astonished to discover once she landed that not only was the ventilation in this room pretty good, but it was abnormally clear and fresh, yet not too cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mom——” In the next moment, she saw her mother. However, her eyes instantly widened, and she opened her mouth, astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The environment in the basement was far better than Nan Qiuqiu had thought before. From her point of view, her mother must’ve suffered a great crime while being held captive by the evil soul masters. However, what about reality? Not only was this basement extremely clean and fresh, but there was even a complete set of clean furniture. There were various types of fruits laid on the table. The ground even had a thick carpet covering it. Other than the heavy atmosphere present, it was practically a luxurious bedroom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, the reason why Nan Qiuqiu was astonished before wasn’t because of the conditions of the room. Instead, it was because of her mother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Nan Shuishui looked somewhat pale, she was quite healthy. She was currently seated by the table eating fruit, and her eyes turned somewhat dull as she saw Nan Qiuqiu arrive. The only abnormal thing about her was that she was completely naked. There was a thin, silver chain on her right leg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mom…” Nan Qiuqiu’s voice was clearly trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fruit in Nan Shuishui’s hand dropped to the table with a thud. Her face instantly paled, and she answered in a trembling voice, “Qiuqiu!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu’s eyes instantly became clear. With a sudden stride forward, she walked over to Nan Shuishui. Right after that, she bent down and unleashed the pinkish-red power of Annihilation on the chain attached to her mother’s feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, although this silver chain looked very thin, it was extremely sturdy. Even her power of Annihilation wasn’t able to damage it in any way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui seemed to have sobered up somewhat as she quickly called out, “Qiuqiu, Qiuqiu, why have you come? Quickly, go! It’ll be troublesome if that person comes back!…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu didn’t look at her mother. Instead, her eyes were fixed on the chain in her hand, “Mom, I’m here to rescue you. I can definitely break this chain.” As she spoke, she raised her soul power to the maximum, causing the chain in her hands to glow pinkish-red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the chain didn’t move at all, and showed no signs of breaking. Nan Qiuqiu’s hands were already starting to bleed. Her tears also began to fall down her cheeks in large drops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wa…” As her tears wildly surged forth, Nan Qiuqiu pounced into her mother’s embrace and cried, “Mom, mom, you’ve suffered! Mom, I’ve come late! Mom…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All sorts of feelings welled up in Nan Shuishui’s heart as she hugged her daughter. She sighed, “Silly girl, it’s not what you’ve thought. Your mother is fine. Although that fellow destroyed my clothes, he didn’t sully me. You’ve thought too deeply into it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah?” Nan Qiuqiu raised her head, and she said with misty eyes, “What happened, then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui had a helpless look on her face as she said, “I knew that fella many years ago. He was one of your father’s love rivals when I was young. When I later married your father, he became an evil soul master in a moment of rage. However, he lost his manhood because of it. I haven’t been sullied by him or anything during these few days. He’s just destroyed my clothes. He comes to see me everyday, and he does his best to take care of my everyday life. To be honest, I don’t hate him. I even feel somewhat guilty. If it wasn’t for me, he wouldn’t have walked the path of an evil soul master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu stared blankly at her mother. She’d never thought that something like this would’ve occurred to her mother in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then what about these chains?” Nan Qiuqiu asked with a depressed look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui laughed bitterly, “I tried breaking them before he fed me that Soul Eradicating Powder. I couldn’t even break it with my cultivation, so there’s no need to talk about whether you can do it. You should go quickly. In any case, he definitely won’t kill me. You should just leave this place safely before considering anything else. Oh, right. Give me a spare change of clothes. If he destroys them again, I’ll just smack my head against a wall and die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then did Nan Qiuqiu come to her senses. She hurriedly took a set of spare clothes from her storage-type soul tool and helped dress her mother. The silver chain bound to her leg proved somewhat of a hindrance, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly, go.” Nan Shuishui’s expression immediately became much better after she was fully dressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu shook her head strongly and hugged her mother tightly. “No, I’m not going. I was only able to find you after much difficulty, so how can I just leave like this? I’ll definitely rescue you. Oh, right. Even if I can’t do it, that fellow might be able to. Yuhao, Yuhao, quickly come down now. The lock on my mother’s leg won’t open.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Nan Qiuqiu’s cry, Huo Yuhao re-entered the room and leapt down into the basement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui nodded softly after seeing him. However, a smidge of red instantly appeared on Nan Qiuqiu’s charming face as she stared at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, she finally understood why Huo Yuhao didn’t follow her down earlier. He must’ve known beforehand that her mother was naked via his Spiritual Detection.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;This fellow...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said respectfully, “Hello, Senior Nan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui sighed softly. “How can you risk your lives like this? Sunrise City is filled with people from the Sun Moon Empire, and there are even people from the Holy Ghost Church! It’s too dangerous. Quickly, go! You two won’t be able to break this chain on my leg!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took the chain from Nan Qiuqiu and looked it over for a few moments. After that, he wiped his forehead with his right hand, and a jade-green light appeared in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a flash of jade-green light, the link instantly snapped clean off. Before Nan Shuishui could even finish speaking, her eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao tugged the chain, and quickly walked over to the ring on the wall it was connected to. The jade light in his hand flashed once again, cutting the ring apart. He immediately put the chain away in his storage-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” Nan Shuishui was completely stunned. She had personally tried breaking this chain using her cultivation as an eight-ringed Soul Douluo, along with the power of Annihilation, and had failed to so so. However, Huo Yuhao was able to break it with no difficulty at all. This was simply inconceivable!</span></p>
