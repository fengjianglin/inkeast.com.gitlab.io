 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though there were experts in the Duke’s Mansion who discovered this problem, they didn’t know what to do. After all, one’s spiritual power was related to his soul. Souls were very magical. If Dai Luoli walked the wrong path, he might suffer from side-effects, which would cause him harm. As a result, Dai Luoli continued to remain in his current state. No matter how hard he tried, he could only unleash half the strength of his martial soul. Naturally, he couldn’t catch up to Dai Yueheng and Dai Huabin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was using a very simple method to stimulate his martial soul: tapping into his feelings for Xu Yun! Using love as stimulation was very difficult, and it might lead to repercussions. Of course, the prerequisite was that this love could be fulfilled after Dai Luoli’s martial soul was stimulated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, Huo Yuhao completely stimulated Dai Luoli’s spiritual power to its extreme, enabling him to enter a state of craziness. Indeed, the spiritual components of his martial soul were completely stimulated, and his soul power rose by two ranks in just a short period of time. Dai Luoli didn’t sense it himself, but he would immediately discover the significant changes to his body after he recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the Blood Tiger projection was about to reach him, Huo Yuhao smiled and quickly shifted his footsteps. In an instant, he was already behind Dai Luoli. While Dai Luoli charged ferociously, the gap between him and Huo Yuhao was simply too huge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he was only relying on his courage to sustain himself now. Huo Yuhao smacked his palm against Dai Luoli’s neck, and Dai Luoli shook slightly before he fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the restraints on Xu Yun suddenly disappeared. She almost fell down, as she was unbalanced. After realizing she could move, she quickly rushed towards Dai Luoli.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The way Dai Luoli had looked at her just now was already deeply etched in her mind. She couldn’t forget the determination and fearlessness in his blood-red eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For me, he…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Xu Yun was only feeling very sad. She quickly helped Dai Luoli up and cried out, “Luoli, Luoli, wake up. You can’t die! Wake up.” As she cried out, tears were already flowing down uncontrollably. She hugged Dai Luoli, who was already covered in blood, tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t stand too far away. He smiled as he looked at them. He knew that at least his brother had found a place inside this princess’s heart. As for how they were going to develop in the future, it was going to be much simpler.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luoli, I’ve already done quite a bit for you. You’ll have to count on yourself from now on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to kill you!” Xu Yun suddenly lifted her head and glared at Huo Yuhao furiously, “You aren’t an ordinary person. Tell me. Who are you? You must be a spy, a spy from the Sun Moon Empire! I’ll get someone to kill you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rolled his eyes and said, “Your Highness, let’s not even talk about whether I’m a soul master first. Just from how you are screaming like that, who can you get to kill me if I kill you and him first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun was stunned. Yes! Only the three of them were here. Why weren’t there any guards patrolling this place even though they had made such a huge commotion? It was because she had told them not to disturb her in her cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, she was the only one who could fight Huo Yuhao! What could she do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao slowly walked towards her. While Xu Yun was a soul master, she was more like a little girl. She lacked fighting experience, and looked very terrified now. As she hugged Dai Luoli tightly, she lost her voice and said, “You, you, don’t come over!...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao calmly smiled and said, “He’s not dead yet. Tell you what, let me kill him first. Then you can swear not to divulge my identity. I’ll spare you then. What about that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible.” Xu Yun carried Dai Luoli as she suddenly stood up. There was a fierce look in her eyes, and she glared at Huo Yuhao. “I’m from the imperial family of the Star Luo Empire. I can only be a princess who dies in a fight, but not a princess who lives humiliatingly. If you want to kill him, then you better kill the both of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My younger brother has good taste! While this princess is a little overbearing and unreasonable, she has her principles.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he discovered that Xu Yun seemed to be thinking of a solution of how to escape from his fingertips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He smiled and his eyes flashed with a trace of dim purplish-gold. Xu Yun suddenly felt a weird spiritual undulation appearing. In the next moment, she became giddy before she fainted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao walked forward and supported her body. After that, he took Dai Luoli from her arms and placed her on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander Xu has fainted!” Huo Yuhao shouted. Then, carrying Dai Luoli, he transformed into an illusory projection before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Dai Luoli woke up from his deep sleep, it was already the next morning. He opened his eyes wide, and the sky was already slightly bright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli only felt that his body was very warm and comfortable. His soul power surged strongly in his body and an unprecedented sense of strength filled his entire body. More strangely, he was stunned to realize that his feeling of everything around him was not a result of his visual perception of them, but because there seemed to be another pair of eyes helping him to survey his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he opened his eyes, Dai Luoli sat up in his bed. The recruits from the First Bunk also woke up at this moment, and quickly donned their uniforms before washing up. After this, they went for breakfast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything that had happened last night played itself out in Dai Luoli’s head. When he looked at his own body, he discovered that there weren’t any injuries. Furthermore, he was dry and clean. His uniform was placed neatly to one side, as if he had never worn it before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was everything last night a dream?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was in disbelief.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was I really dreaming? No, I couldn’t be. How could it be so painful in my dream? Yes, it was him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He twisted his head to look at Tang Dong. Tang Dong had just changed into his uniform, and was lazily stretching his waist. It seemed like he could sense Dai Luoli looking over, and immediately turned his head to look back. After this, he revealed a kind smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was too curious, and couldn’t take it anymore. He quickly got up from his bed and put his uniform on before going to find Tang Dong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was confused as he asked, “Tang Dong, what happened to me last night? Why do I remember that I was being beaten up very tragically by you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled, “Is that so? If you think that’s the case, then that’s the case. However, do you really not remember what happened? Come on, let’s go have breakfast. I’ll tell you as we eat.” As he spoke, he dragged Dai Luoli to go freshen up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli looked at him with an abnormal expression, and was even more confused. However, it wasn’t very appropriate for him to question Tang Dong with so many recruits around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

In the canteen, they squatted down at one side to have their breakfast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What exactly happened last night?” Dai Luoli couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Let’s not talk while we eat. Let’s talk after we finish eating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli felt as if a ball of fire were slowly rising in his chest. If not for the fact that he couldn’t beat Huo Yuhao, he would have whacked him by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that this was only a thought in his head. He knew he didn’t have any chance of winning against someone as perverted as Huo Yuhao. He could only continue eating. After he quickly finished his breakfast, he turned his attention towards Huo Yuhao again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Come, let me show you something.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao grabbed his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the start, Dai Luoli wasn’t very used to Huo Yuhao doing this. However, he started to become more accustomed to it after a month. Anyway, he couldn’t beat Huo Yuhao in a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was different this time. When Huo Yuhao grabbed his shoulder, Dai Luoli suddenly sensed everything around him changing. The originally bright sky turned dark, and daytime turned to nighttime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he exclaimed, Huo Yuhao’s voice already sounded in his mind, “Don’t be shocked. Take a closer look. Don’t you want to know what happened last night?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was nighttime. It was nighttime in their military camp, and they were on the military drill grounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Dai Luoli saw himself charging towards Huo Yuhao like a mad tiger. However, he was flung back every single time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t an illusion. Everything that had happened last night was true. It wasn’t an illusion! Furthermore, he watched how anxious he was as a bystander. However, he didn’t know why Xu Yun was unable to move. When he saw the expression on Xu Yun’s face, Dai Luoli subconsciously clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take a look at yourself.” Huo Yuhao’s voice sounded again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli subconsciously turned his attention towards his own body. Suddenly, he realized there was something different about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw the Blood Tiger projection behind him and sensed the powerful spiritual undulations that he released, he was in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is that really me? But why am I so different? Since when was my spiritual power so great? Did my soul power increase today because of…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he was wondering about a lot of things, he saw himself being thrown to the ground by Huo Yuhao once again before he lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this, he saw Xu Yun charging to his side and hugging him tightly. She was crying for him. She even mentioned how she was willing to die with him when Huo Yuhao claimed that he wanted to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this, Xu Yun fainted. Huo Yuhao then shouted before leaving with him. He found a water vat near the canteen and cleaned him up before stealing a new uniform from the military store.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The illusory nighttime disappeared, and it was daytime again. Everything returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you feel?” Huo Yuhao’s voice sounded once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli twisted his head to look at him as if he were looking at a monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and asked, “I’m asking you about your feelings after seeing what I’ve shown you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli subconsciously said, “It would have been great if I was conscious when Yun’er hugged me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was speechless as he smacked his forehead and said, “I knew it. You emotional creature! I was asking you how you felt when you erupted last night. Didn’t you realize that your martial soul has become different?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was very wary as he looked at Huo Yuhao and said, “Who are you exactly? What’s with that illusion just now? Also, how did you know Yun’er was a princess?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed, “It seems you’re not that dumb after all. I’m Tang Dong. I’m only Tang Dong. You just need to know that. You should have felt that you’ve gained something over the past month. You must work hard for your Yun’er, though. This is all that I can do for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he turned around and walked towards their bunk. They still had some time to rest before their training started.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli seemed very uncertain as he watched Huo Yuhao leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who is he exactly?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how slow he was right now, he could still sense that Huo Yuhao wasn’t an ordinary person. He had three rings, but he couldn’t defeat an ordinary person? He was very doubtful about this. Even Xu Yun was also weaker than him, even though she had four rings. It seemed like they were both very far off from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I should have thought that he was a soul master. I just don’t know what type of soul master he is. However, what’s he doing in the military?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s right. I can sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli calmed down and carefully recalled everything that had happened between him and Tang Dong over the last month. While he was beaten up every day, he was surprised to realize that his cultivation had slowly increased. It was something that had never happened before. Even when his father took some time to guide him, the improvements he made couldn’t compare to what he had achieved over the last month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weirder thing was the state he was in last night…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He said that my martial soul has changed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shut his eyes and silently sensed his martial soul. Very soon, he was surprised, and immersed in this delightful surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, his martial soul had indeed changed. In fact, it had grown stronger, which was beyond his imagination. He felt as if he had been reborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Dong, who are you? Did my father send you to help me? However, he clearly looks like he’s around the same age as me! Why is he so strong? Who exactly is he?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he carried these doubts with him, Dai Luoli continued to sense his martial soul. The spirituality of his martial soul had finally been awakened. Everything had changed, and become very beautiful.</span></p>
