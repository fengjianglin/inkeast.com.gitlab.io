 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong weren’t the only ones who these Titled Douluo were paying attention to. Even Shrek Academy’s status within their minds was greatly elevated because of the abilities that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were displaying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t aware of the psychological changes that were happening in these Titled Douluo’s minds, but he could guess some of them. Even though he had the Body Douluo’s support and he could lead these formidable individuals, their statuses within the world of soul masters were too high. If he didn’t show some prowess, he couldn’t convince them at all. But now there seemed to be no problem at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was, they weren’t the only ones who were astonished; even Huo Yuhao himself was surprised by his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He almost didn’t leave Shrek City at all when he was cultivating hard for the past two years, and he barely even left the Tang Sect. Tang Wutong had returned to his side, and even though that mysterious seal was affecting him, his heart and mind had been very clear and unperturbed over the past two years because he was with the person he loved. He was also cultivating with the help of Haodong power, and his improvement was exponential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had always believed that he was increasing more of his soul power, but only today did he realize that his spiritual power had also grown to an incredibly powerful standard without his knowledge. His spiritual power had grown to a level that he almost found unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t feel like he was expending any spiritual power at all when he was using Spiritual Detection, and he could only feel his consciousness stretching out like the entire world was in his grasp. That feeling was very magical, and it also contained an inexplicable profundity. Therefore, he unwittingly expanded his detection’s area of effect to more than ten thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could feel almost everything in the skies above and the ground below at a whim, and the surveillance soul tools that the Sun Moon Empire had deployed both in the air and on the ground were within his detection range. Huo Yuhao also discovered to his surprise as he was using Spiritual Detection that he could even sense those surveillance soul tools’ detection range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he could sense that was because the energy waves that these surveillance soul tools were releasing, no matter what type they were, were conducted through energy. Thermal and oscillation detectors, as surveillance soul tools that relied on vision, had a very small range. They were what the Sun Moon Empire was researching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Huo Yuhao could vividly sense all these energy waves, he could naturally and casually take everyone away from danger, circle past these soul tools’ detection ranges, and directly towards the Sun Moon Empire’s inner territory. They began to accelerate, and an altitude of six thousand meters was the maximum that practically all surveillance soul tools could reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao also realized that the Sun Moon Empire actually had a kind of ultra-long range aerial surveillance soul tool on the ground. A soul tool like that could release a powerful energy beam that surged high into the sky, and it could reach even ten thousand meters in the air to conduct surveillance. But it also had one fatal flaw: the beam could only sweep continuously through the sky. It couldn’t conduct surveillance over an entire area at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao understood that feature very easily. Just as he was using Spiritual Detection, the distance that he could reach when he was detecting in a single direction was vastly different from when he was detecting over an area. The Sun Moon Empire had probably developed a soul tool like that by compressing an oscillation detector’s surveillance capability and compromising on area of effect so that it could achieve a longer range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single surveillance soul tool like that was naturally ineffective, but if there were many, and if they crossed each other as they made their sweeps, such a setup would be effective to some extent. However, it appeared like the Sun Moon Empire didn’t have many of these surveillance soul tools, so Huo Yuhao and the others didn’t run into too much trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faint light flickered as a dash of ice-cold light flashed across Huo Yuhao’s face. His consciousness continued to stretch outward, and he almost couldn’t control the desire in his heart. He wanted to see exactly how far his Spiritual Detection could reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his Spiritual Detection’s area had reached more than fifteen thousand meters, he finally suppressed the impulse in his heart. The reason was because he discovered to his astonishment that he still hadn’t reached his limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How’s that possible?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference from before and now was far too large, and he was pushing his detection out in all directions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This didn’t seem like something that normal growth in spiritual power could achieve. Huo Yuhao began to understand through this period of experience that his spiritual power was actually increasing at an incredible speed because of his spiritual soul core, but he wasn’t that sure about it on typical days, because his spiritual power was compressed and gathered within his soul core. Forming a soul core in one’s dantian was extremely rare in the world of soul masters, and how effective that turned out to be far exceeded Huo Yuhao’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that feeling of his consciousness extending, like heaven and earth were in his grasp, evidently wasn’t because of his spiritual power’s skyrocketing growth. Instead, it stemmed from another kind of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This feeling was similar to when Huo Yuhao had first met the Calamity Necromancer, Electrolux’s aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao could faintly see that this had to have something to do with his entry into the mystical God Realm, and with the approval that he received from the God of Emotion. His spiritual power, or perhaps his consciousness, seemed to have gone through certain qualitative changes. These qualitative changes allowed his spiritual power and spirit to reach a whole new level. If he went according to how his teacher, Electrolux had said before, this level was called Divine Sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao understood that his divine sense was still incomplete, and could only be considered half of the real thing because it came from a Godly Seat’s approval. But even then, the benefits conferred upon him were quite conspicuous. Not even he could tell what kind of level his all-out fighting strength could reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sensed his body’s transformations as he brought everyone successfully into the Sun Moon Empire’s territory. His spiritual power’s tremendous growth caused him to change his thought process. With the range and area that his Spiritual Detection could reach, he didn’t have to worry about any surveillance soul tools at all. Naturally, they didn’t have to progress on foot. Flying at high speed through the air could save a lot of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao immediately lowered their altitude once they passed through the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance lockdown perimeter. They went down to about three thousand meters, while their flight speed accelerated swiftly as he brought the group of Titled Douluo deep into the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Titled Douluo were starting to become a little numb. They were feeling far too many mystical things because Huo Yuhao was sharing his Spiritual Detection with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many Titled Douluo were prepared to die to ensure that this mission was a success. However, their moods were a lot better than before at this point. With such a magical companion who was so adept at concealment and surveillance around, there was no doubt that their success rate and guarantee of safety were greatly improved. Huo Yuhao’s status in every Titled Douluo’s mind was rising continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They flew for four hours before Huo Yuhao reduced his speed and took everyone down into a dense, thick forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all Titled Douluo, and their flight speeds were just too terrifying. The Ming Dou Mountain Range was bordering the Sun Moon Empire in the first place, and once they entered the Sun Moon Empire’s territory, it took them four hours to come close to Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone drifted to the ground. Huo Yuhao stretched his Spiritual Detection far into the distance once more within this dense forest, and all that was happening within this forest and within his Spiritual Detection’s area of effect was telling him that they were absolutely safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stopped using Imitation and stopped sharing his Spiritual Detection as he smiled and turned towards the Titled Douluo. “Let’s rest for a while, everyone, and readjust ourselves. We’re not far from Radiant City, and we’ll enter in the evening.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi stared at Huo Yuhao with a strange look in his eyes. “Kid, you have given me too many surprises. How did you do all that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Titled Douluo’s eyes were also trained on Huo Yuhao, and strange expressions filled every single one of their eyes. There was also something in their eyes that wasn’t there before: equality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, in this moment, they were treating Huo Yuhao as someone who shared the same standard and prowess as they did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “The truth is, Wutong and my martial souls can fuse. Therefore, we complement and support each other, and only then can we achieve things that normal soul masters cannot. This isn’t my individual strength.” He raised his hand, which was holding Tang Wutong’s hand, as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thought occurred to Du Busi as he heard his words, and only then did he realize that he had overlooked the incredibly beautiful girl who barely spoke, who had been following beside Huo Yuhao this entire time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Martial soul fusion? That’s just extraordinary! If I remember correctly, you have twin martial souls, while your spiritual-type martial soul should be mainly used for control and detection. Your other martial soul possesses Ultimate Ice, and it’s mainly used for battle. If not for the fact that the circumstances don’t allow it, I would truly wish to see exactly what kind of strength you can reach. Shrek Academy will no longer have to worry about anything for the next century with you in their future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi was full of lament as he spoke. His Body Sect had many prodigious soul masters, but they would obviously lose their luster when compared to Huo Yuhao. They weren’t even at the same standard. Du Busi could tell that this youth, who was just a little more than twenty years old, had completely grown up. He was now positioned among the most powerful individuals in the world of soul masters, while his greatest advantage was his age. He was just a little more than twenty, and this meant he would undoubtedly become a Transcendent Douluo in the future. At the same time, he had a high chance of becoming an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
