 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…” If one’s stare could kill, Huo Yuhao would be completely filled with holes now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Xuan Ziwen was about to explode in anger, Huo Yuhao made a move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lifted his right hand and covered that piece of rare metal. Xuan Ziwen immediately stopped himself from saying what he wanted to say. He held it back so hard that his face turned red. He was truly in discomfort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he focused his gaze in the next moment. He could clearly see a streak of dark-blue flame dancing on Huo Yuhao’s fingertips. He only gently rubbed his right hand over that piece of rare metal before a layer of fine powder fell and scattered proportionally around the piece of rare metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was the one who had chosen this piece of rare metal. Of course he knew how resilient it was. However, Huo Yuhao didn’t seem to have summoned a lot of his soul power. Golden lights flashed in his eyes, as if he had used his Spirit Eyes. What were the dark-blue flames that danced on his fingertips?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a Class 9 soul engineer, Xuan Ziwen was also very sharp. When he focused his gaze, he clearly saw a small carving blade moving between Huo Yuhao’s fingers. This blade emanated a dark-blue light. As Huo Yuhao’s fingers were too agile and his movements were too quick, it seemed like dark-blue flames dancing on Huo Yuhao’s fingertips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What carving blade was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiuan Ziwen naturally knew what carving blades Huo Yuhao had. The most special among them all was his Life Guardian Blade. It was just that it was a little weird to use it as a carving blade after it grew bigger. Huo Yuhao usually used normal carving blades, or his own Darkgolden Terrorclaws. After all, the sharpness of his terrorclaws exceeded most other carving blades. He could even use all five of his fingers and control them as freely as he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his first time seeing this dark-blue carving blade. Suddenly, Xuan Ziwen guessed that Huo Yuhao was probably able to finish the carving of the core formations in such a short period of time because of this carving blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What happened next proved Xuan Ziwen’s guess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s right hand kept on sweeping over the surface of the rare metal, while his left hand was performing some auxiliary work. He made use of the tools on the laboratory desk and adjusted the position of the piece of metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen couldn’t see clearly. He had already focused on his attention, but he discovered that he still couldn’t detect any signs of the carving blade making carvings as Huo Yuhao moved his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What left him very impressed was that Huo Yuhao was very precise with every cut he made even though he was so quick. The powder that scattered around was proportionally arranged around the perimeter of the ball. There weren’t any signs of messiness. His carving technique was indeed magical!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Xuan Ziwen knew many Class 9 soul engineers from the Sun Moon Empire. However, he was entirely sure that the technique that Huo Yuhao was using now was certainly not the style of those Class 9 soul engineers. Furthermore, the piece of rare metal resembled a piece of tofu under his carving blade. In just a while, the rough shape of the core formation was already achieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At times, that dark-blue flame slashed down. At other times, it was like a thin needle that pierced the rare metal. Occasionally, it manifested itself as countless streaks of light. Xuan Ziwen was dazzled as he watched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Godly skill, it’s a godly skill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen found it more and more difficult to breathe. He did his best to control it, but his heartbeat was getting faster and faster. Such a carving technique was like a godly skill.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When did Huo Yuhao learn such a mysterious and unpredictable carving technique? It’s too magical.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With such a carving technique, it was no wonder he could carve the core formation of a Class 9 soul tool, even given his abilities as a Class 8 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, it’s not just his carving technique. There must be something wrong with his carving blade as well. Where does such a sharp carving blade exist? Even the number one carving blade on the leaderboard is only the best because of its elemental type. It can carry up to three elements at once. But Huo Yuhao’s carving blade doesn’t exude any kind of elemental aura, even though it’s definitely very sharp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was very sharp. Very soon, he discovered the key point. To prevent his heavy breathing from affecting Huo Yuhao, he subconsciously covered his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression was very serious, and he appeared very focused. Once he entered his focused state, he completely ignored the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his understanding over the past few days, he had already gotten used to the Rain Dragon's Dance. Although he didn’t have full comprehension of it, his understanding of it had gotten better and better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The more he understood it, the more he was astonished by its profundity. In Xuan Ziwen’s eyes, it was a godly skill. Wasn’t it exactly the same for Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Rain Dragon's Dance seemed like something that no human could come up with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Huo Yuhao could learn this carving technique was because the God of Emotions had imprinted all the secrets of carving techniques in the depths of his spirit. He had also imparted all his understanding to Huo Yuhao. However, Huo Yuhao’s talent in this aspect couldn’t be ignored.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had used carving blades for ten years, and possessed a strong foundation. At the same time, he practiced with the Tang Sect’s Hidden Weapons. The agility of his fingers far exceeded that of ordinary people. In addition, his spiritual power was much greater than most people. Due to all these reasons, he was able to understand such a magical carving technique in such a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time passed, second after second. Xuan Ziwen moved from his original state of astonishment to being bedazzled. He was completely immersed by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he couldn’t completely see Huo Yuhao’s carving technique, he still learned a lot. By using this carving technique, Huo Yuhao was using a different route compared to most traditional soul engineers. There were some characteristics that Xuan Ziwen could intercalibrate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he possibly miss out on such an opportunity?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One hour, two hours!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The complexity of this core formation was far greater than the previous two core formations. A good two hours passed. When Huo Yuhao finally lifted his right hand, the Ghostcarving Blade turned into three streaks of light that landed on the core formation and moved as if they were agile snakes. They twisted and turned, making cuts on the core formation. This was the final step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then the blade was put away, and the blue light disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stretched out his left hand and touched the surface of the core formation with one finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen couldn’t stop him before he poured his soul power into the core formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to know that soul engineers would normally check whether a core formation was working before they would pour in their soul power into it to test it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao seemed to have intentionally skipped this step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Weng——” A soft buzz sounded. The entire core formation lit up. An orange-red light first shone inside before it started to spread from the holes in the core formation. Dense soul power undulations were released, and rings of orange-red light started to spread. The entire core formation was like an artistic piece that shone with bright light. It was smooth and bright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s done!” Xuan Ziwen shouted. His voice was trembling slightly, as he was too agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao also let out a long breath. He sat on the chair behind him and was panting heavily. This was also his first time working on such a complex core formation. He was completely certain that he would need several years to create such a core formation if he didn’t know the Rain Dragon's Dance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was secretly grateful towards the God of Emotions in his heart. This carving technique was too appropriate for making soul tools. In his mind, he also unwittingly thought of the Icy Clouds of the Nine Azure Dragons that Nian Rongbing had carved. He revealed a slight grin on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his mind soon went empty. After overusing his brain, the first side effect was that his senses became a little dull and slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen looked fondly at the core formation in front of him. After checking it again and again, he verified that it was truly completed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he looked at Huo Yuhao again, there was no longer an excoriating and critical look on his face. There was only a passionate look in his eyes now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao!” Xuan Ziwen gently called.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao’s senses were a little slow right now, he still shuddered a little when he heard Xuan Ziwen’s voice. “Teacher Xuan, what’s wrong with you? Don’t call to me like that. I’ll get goosebumps.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was smiling as he arrived in front of Huo Yuhao. After this, he grabbed his shoulders and shook him with great force. “Tell me, tell me how this magical carving technique came about. Tell me, or I’ll strangle you to death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was dizzy from all the shaking. “Calm down, calm down Teacher Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Xuan Ziwen calm down right now? Huo Yuhao used his actions to create miracle after miracle. A Class 8 soul engineer that had just obtained eight rings was able to come up with such an important core formation for a Class 9 soul tool in such a short period of time. It was a miracle in the history of soul engineers! How could he possibly calm down?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Huo Yuhao used his Instant Teleportation to break free from Xuan Ziwen’s grasp. After this, he retrieved his Ghostcarving Blade and passed it to Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen felt a sinister aura when he grabbed hold of the blade. The sharpness of the blade even stopped him from taking an extra glance at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he tried to use it, the blade turned into a streak of blue light that flew back into Huo Yuhao’s vertical eye before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, don’t even think about using it. This blade has already fused with me and become a part of me. It won’t be used by anyone else.” Huo Yuhao could subtly sense a special aura from his carving blade. It was like a living entity. When Xuan Ziwen touched it, it generated a strong resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen asked, “What about the carving technique? What’s with that? Yuhao, tell me. How have I treated you over these few years?”</span></p>
