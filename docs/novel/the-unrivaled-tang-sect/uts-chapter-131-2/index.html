 <p>Huo Yuhao felt the chill this time. The ice-cold flow of gas rose rapidly along his left arm and penetrated his shoulder. Then, it reached his chest and clavicle. An intense, azure light also shone from his body.</p>
 <p>The power sealed within the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton was stimulated and rapidly connected with the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone. Huo Yuhao’s left arm was also dyed an azure green. An intense undulation of soul power surged maniacally. The pain that he felt when he had once fused the skeleton appeared again.</p>
 <p>Ultimate ice and heat alternated with each other. Fortunately, it was only on his left arm this time.</p>
 <p>“What, again?” Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly in heart. But he couldn’t do anything except tolerate it at this point.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not that the Ice Empress wanted to train him. It was that the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton was modifying this Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone.</p>
 <p>No matter how strong this Ice Jade Scorpion was, its cultivation was only around ten thousand years or so, whereas the Ice Empress had cultivated for four hundred thousand years!</p>
 <p>The skeleton was the core of the body, and the spine was the most important of the six soul bones. The rest of the soul bones connected to it. If it were any other soul bone, the Ice Empress might not be bothered. But this Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone came from the same origin as her, and thus the modifications were very smooth. The key lay in the sense of familiarity!</p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The immense power sealed within the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton started to surge into the left arm bone. Huo Yuhao wasn’t in any danger, but the pain he once felt came back…</span></p>
 <p>......</p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Shrek Academy. External Co</span>urtyard. Second grade, Class 1.</p>
 <p>“Why is everyone silent? Have all of you become dumb?” Zhou Yi suddenly slammed the table and revealed an infuriated look.</p>
 <p>The students under her kept quiet out of fear; no one dared to speak.</p>
 <p>While Zhou Yi’s teaching method was simple and crude, it was quite suitable if she wanted to intimidate these talented youths. In the past year or so, the students from Class 1 maintained strong camaraderie and achieved significant progress under her. The crucial thing was that they listened to her! No one dared to defy Zhou Yi, and all of them diligently completed the tasks that she gave them.</p>
 <p>While Zhou Yi had expelled many in the first academic year, not one student had yet been expelled in the second academic year. She would at most reprimand them if they made mistakes, or even give them two kicks. They would be motivated to cultivate harder through this.</p>
 <p>However, the current atmosphere in the classroom was very tense, and all the students lowered their heads.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi scanned everyone before she fixed her attention was on Zhou Sichen. “Zhou Sichen, stand up.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen lamented in his heart and knew that he couldn’t escape. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have become the class monitor after Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong left.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yunchen bit the bullet, stood up and answered, “Teacher Zhou.”</p>
 <p>“Did you not eat?” Zhou Yi raged, “you don’t seem to have any guts! You’re a man. Puff up your chest.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Zhou Sichen acknowledged her words and puffed up his chest.</p>
 <p>“Tell me,” Zhou Yi said indifferently, “as the class monitor, what are you going to do with regards to the competition suggested by the Class 2?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen’s lips moved a little, and he shouted in his heart, “Go for it!”</p>
 <p>“I’ll go.” He replied loudly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi’s eyes lit up. “Good. This is how my students should be. So what if you lose? I don’t expect you to win. But we must have the aura. As the class monitor, I will give you full authority to choose your team members. Choose another six to compete with you.”</p>
 <p>The second academic year was already halfway done, and the mid-term exams had ended. Class 1 had tipped Class 2 to become the most outstanding class in the level. This was achieved even without Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>Class 2 was unconvinced! That’s why the teacher of Class 2, Mu Jin, proposed to Zhou Yi for both classes to have a friendly competition. Both classes would choose 7 members each to form a team. The losing team had to sweep the level where all the second grade classes were held for the rest of the academic year.</p>
 <p>The punishment for losing was nothing. Sweeping and maintaining hygiene were nothing to these young soul masters. They were fighting for glory in this competition. The losing team would lose the glory of their class!</p>
 <p>Class 3 or 4 wouldn’t participate in this competition. If they weren’t auxiliary-type soul masters, they possessed miscellaneous martial souls. They weren’t in a position to challenge the assault-type, control-type, defense-type and agility-type soul masters in the first and second classes.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi and Mu Jin were rivals in love in the past. Zhou Yi also had a hot temper. After being provoked by Mu Jin, she accepted the challenge impulsively. But she immediately regretted agreeing to the challenge. She would naturally be unafraid if Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao were in the academy. Since Class 2 had Dai Huabin, Xie Huanyue, Zhu Lu and the others, Class 1 would have an absolute advantage only if 7 members were selected to compete. But she had lost three of her most outstanding students, negating her advantage in this competition. It was rumored that Dai Huabin’s soul power had reached Rank 39 after a period of tireless cultivation. He might become Shrek Academy’s youngest soul ancestor ever.</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin was very strong himself. No one from Class 1 could win against him in a one-on-one situation. In addition, he and Zhu Lu possessed the Netherworld White Tiger. In a 7 v 7 team battle, it would take a miracle for Class 1 to win.</p>
 <p>But Zhou Yi couldn’t take back her words. With Zhou Yi’s temper, she couldn’t back off even if she regretted her decision! That’s why she could only try to relieve the pressure. She figured that losing the competition wasn’t the end of the world, and it was enough if her students managed to unleash their rightful abilities. She would keep an eye on the competition and prevent her students from getting hurt.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi heard from Fan Yu that Huo Yuhao and the other two were back, but they were taken to Sea God’s Island. Fan Yu was also unclear why they hadn’t returned to class. He only told Zhou Yi that it was a good thing for the three of them.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi had asked about them several times over the past few days. While Fan Yu’s status wasn’t low in the Soul Tool Department, he still didn’t have the right to inquire about news from the Sea God’s Pavilion. The competition was coming soon, and she couldn’t hesitate any further. That’s why she had to start picking her members.<br>Zhou Sichen revealed a cheeky look on his face after he heard Zhou Yi’s words. He scanned the class, and there was a myriad of expressions from the other students. Some dodged his gaze, while some begged him to spare them. They were not afraid of competing, but who was willing to throw their own face knowing that they were bound to lose?</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen lifted his hand and tapped on Cao Jinxuan beside him. He said with an awe-inspiring look on his face, “Brother, we might not have been born on the same day or at the same time. But we hope to die on the same day and time. Follow me into battle.”</p>
 <p>Cao Jinxuan’s lips trembled a little as he lifted his head to glare at Zhou Sichen. He seemed to subvocalize something to him. Zhou Sichen could only subtly make out that Cao Jinxuan was cursing his father. He tried his best to withhold his laughter before looking at the rest.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi seemed to relinquish her authority and allowed Zhou Sichen to choose as he pleased. She also approved of Zhou Sichen in her heart, as he was quite capable. He made a conscious decision to choose Cao Jinxuan. Cao Jinxuan was his best friend, while this competition didn’t bode well. By choosing Cao Jinxuan first, what could the others say if they were chosen next?</p>
 <p>“Lan Susu, Lan Luoluo. The two of you shall come along too. The two of you shall complement Little Cao, who will be the main controller.”</p>
 <p>Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo nodded their heads lightly. They were well-liked in class, and they were also very good-tempered, which made them close to the rest. Although everyone was still young, there were many male students who had already developed a liking towards them. Once they were picked up, there were immediately a few who volunteered themselves to be their chaperone.</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen very quickly picked out the strongest three. They were all assault-type soul masters. Thus, their team of 7 was formed.</p>
 <p>There were 4 assault-type and 3 control-type soul masters. This was a rather good combination of assault-type and control-type soul masters.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi nodded and said, “Alright, the 7 of you shall practice in the afternoon. Tomorrow’s competition shall depend on the 7 of you. There’s no punishment for losing, but the reward for winning is being relieved of your cleaning duties in the class. Class has ended. Everyone is free to do what you want. The 7 of you, follow me.”</p>
 <p>After she finished speaking, Zhou Yi turned around. While she wasn’t confident in tomorrow’s competition, she didn’t want to give up either. She was making her last-minute preparations and giving tips on how her students should work with one another. Zhou Sichen, Cao Jinxuan, Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo were all the academy’s core disciples even though their overall strength was inferior to their opponents’. They were not that bad themselves either! They were all close to Rank 30.</p>
 <p>Class 2 was also choosing their team, although the atmosphere was different from Class 1. They managed to pick their choices much more easily.</p>
 <p>Mu Jin stood behind the podium and chose her team members directly, “Dai Huabin, Zhu Lu, Xie Huanyue, Wu Feng, Huang Chutian, Cui Yajie and Long Xiangyue. The 7 of you shall compete tomorrow. I won’t say too many motivational words. If all of you don’t want to continue living in Class 1’s shadow, then give it your all. I want to see if Zhou Yi still dares to be complacent in front of me.”</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin sat quietly in the last row. He appeared much steadier now, and had lost some of the arrogance that he had had in the past. A greater sense of gloominess was revealed in his eyes as he blinked. He also seemed to be less magnanimous compared to his elder brother, Dai Yueheng.</p>
 <p>But one couldn’t deny his talent in cultivation. He was even better than his seniors. His Rank 39 soul power wasn’t a joke; that was his true cultivation. Although it wasn’t easy to rise from Rank 39 to Rank 40, Dai Huabin was determined to do so before he entered the third year. He wanted to obtain his fourth soul ring.</p>
