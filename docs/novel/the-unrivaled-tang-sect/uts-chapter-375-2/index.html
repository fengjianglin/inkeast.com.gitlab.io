 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm chortled and said, “At least you haven’t forgotten your roots! That force then was simply too scary!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Are you talking about the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley?” After hearing Skydream mention that place, Huo Yuhao’s gaze turned cold. If not for the valley, Wang Dong’er wouldn’t have been put into a coma. Even though his soul power was increased by five ranks before he left, he didn’t have a good impression of that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm sighed and said, “Don’t be sad. We could feel what happened to you. However, we were suppressed by that force, and couldn’t wake up. Even if we were awake, we wouldn’t have been able to help you with anything. Don’t even think about resisting that force. If we are not wrong, the force hidden within the valley might be related to the gods.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was moved. “Brother Skydream, are you saying that there are gods there? Is it true that that valley was where the Love God perished?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm said, “I don’t know if it’s really the Love God. However, I’m afraid that only the strength of a god can suppress the spiritual origins of both the Ice Empress and myself. We couldn’t even think of resisting it. Don’t waste your effort trying to resist it, it’s impossible. Furthermore, we could also sense that it held no ill intentions toward any of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No ill intentions? Dong’er was almost tortured to death!” Huo Yuhao said coldly. He clenched his hands into fists, and his gaze turned cold. He wasn’t the old Huo Yuhao anymore. In the past, he would have cursed or lost his cool entirely. But as he grew up and experienced more things, he became steadier and more composed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm shook his head and continued, “Alright, we’ll not talk about that place anymore. In any case, don’t return there. Talk about yourself. When we woke up this time, we discovered significant changes to your body. You were actually able to fuse the strength of both the Ice Empress and the Snow Empress?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “I’m only at the initial stages of fusion. I think the martial soul the Ice Empress passed to me isn’t complete, even though it’s Ultimate Ice. More accurately speaking, there’s a chance of making it stronger. Furthermore, I haven’t been able to digest the origin of the strength the Ice Empress left behind, mainly because my cultivation is lacking, and my Elemental type is still a little different from the Ice Empress. That’s why I tried to tap into the Snow Empress’ strength after fusing it with the Ice Empress to increase the quality of my martial soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Huo Yuhao’s words, the Skydream Iceworm was silent for a moment before he sighed and said, “Yuhao, do you know what you’re talking about? Increasing the quality of your martial soul? It’s not something that has ever happened among humans or soul beasts. Martial souls are innate. If you are able to increase the quality of your martial soul, you’ll be the first person to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t too concerned with this. “It’s probably because I’m lucky. The Snow and Ice Empresses are almost of the same Element. More importantly, their strengths aren’t conflicting. These are the reasons why I’m able to proceed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm said, “It seems like you are very familiar with your body’s condition. Since you can achieve this, you can start absorbing the origin power the Ice Empress left in your body. Your cultivation speed will increase that way. At the same time, you can slowly absorb the most essential part of the spiritual power I left in your body. The biggest problem that you have right now is your body. Your body isn’t strong enough. It needs to be strengthened further. Otherwise, you’ll experience problems not long after you absorb this power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and asked, “I understand what you mean. Do you want me to continue fusing soul bones?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm replied, “Yes. In addition, the next soul bone you fuse will need to be of higher quality. The soul bones that you have now are the Ice Empress’ skeleton, the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone, and that left leg bone that allows for Instant Teleportation. Honestly speaking, only the Ice Empress’ skeleton is able to slightly increase your physical strength. The other two soul bones are less effective at increasing your strength due to the fact that they have special abilities. As a result, the skull, right arm and right leg bones that you are going to fuse with next have to be focused on increasing your physical strength. In this way, you can better fuse with the strength of the Ice Empress.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for the Snow Empress, the origin power that she left behind will become a self-sustaining entity on its own, and won’t be absorbed by you, as she has become your Spirit. However, it’ll continue to contribute to your physical growth. I believe you can feel this, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “Alright, I’ll try to find suitable soul bones as quickly as possible. However, soul bones are too important to soul masters. In the eyes of any soul master, soul bones are absolute treasures. It isn’t going to be easy to obtain them. Moreover, I need those of sufficiently good quality. I can only search for them slowly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, my body isn’t a glaring problem yet. After fusing with the immense life power of the Life Gold, my current physical state can help me last until I’ve obtained eight rings. The soul power from my Ultimate Ice won’t drain my body, either. After I’ve obtained eight rings, I’ll need to further strengthen my body. On the other hand, I’m starting to develop some problems in terms of my spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After this closed-door cultivation, I can sense that my spiritual power seems to have increased. In addition, this increase is in terms of quality. However, I feel that my spiritual sea is unable to handle this increase anymore. After exiting my closed-door cultivation, I’m afraid of cultivating my spiritual power further. Is there any way I can solve this problem?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm shook his head and answered, “I don’t have any special method to help you in that area. Your spiritual power didn’t just come from me, a portion of it came from Elder Yi. Elder Yi had already taken half a step into the realm of Gods. His spiritual origin, or rather the fragments of his divine sense, had a trace of a divine existence within them. After you fuse with them completely, your spiritual power will be able to increase even faster, until you reach the concrete-immaterial realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, your brain will start to experience problems if your spiritual power becomes too strong. It’s still the same advice – get soul bones, especially a skull! It must be of good quality too. The best choice would be the skull of a hundred-thousand year soul beast. Your problems will be solved if it’s compatible. If your spiritual power can rise to another level, it will reach the level I was at when you first met me. When that happens, you’ll be able to protect yourself even if your abilities won’t increase significantly. It won’t be easy for a soul beast to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “Brother, you called me in to say all this? I know everything you’re trying to say! Can you give me more clues?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm said, “Why are you so rushed? I haven’t chatted with you in a long time. Let’s chat more. Of course I’m trying to advise you, just like I helped you capture Bingbing!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t call me Bingbing!” the Ice Empress’ cold voice sounded. A streak of bluish-green light flashed past and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion appeared above the Skydream Iceworm. She smacked a pincer on his head, and he immediately disappeared back into Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was surprised. “Ice Empress, you’re awake too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, Huo Yuhao felt that the Ice Empress sounded very weird. There seemed to be something else about her. She sounded… shy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm re-surfaced from another part of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea, and he was fawning again. “Alright, I won’t call you Bingbing. Why don’t you sleep longer? I can tell Yuhao everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress coldly replied, “You are full of nonsense. You spoke for half a day without getting to the main topic. Yuhao, your soul power is already at a bottleneck. You need to obtain new soul rings to improve further. In terms of your spiritual power, we feel that you can consider finding a species of soul beast called an Evileye Tyrant. You can try to fuse with an Evileye Tyrant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, yes, that,” the Skydream Iceworm immediately added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up.” The Ice Empress snapped at Skydream, and he quickly shut his mouth. He looked indignant, but didn’t dare to retort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s going on with the two of you? I feel like something’s wrong!” Huo Yuhao was curious as he looked at the Ice Empress, before looking at the Skydream Iceworm again. He didn’t even seem to be interested when the Ice Empress mentioned an Evileye Tyrant, which was a type of soul beast he had never heard of before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress snorted in fury, and glared at Skydream with her crystal-yellow eyes, which were filled with a threatening light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing, nothing. Yuhao, why are you guessing blindly? Bingbing and I are purely friends. Our friendship is pure. Am I right, Bingbing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Scram!…” The Ice Empress sounded a little weak right now, and her shyness was revealed once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright, I’ll scram. Don’t get angry. I’ll scram.” As he spoke, he flashed and disappeared into Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea. Huo Yuhao immediately felt the ring around his finger formed by the Skydream Iceworm’s actual body was moving gently.</span></p>
