 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. Ye Guyi, follow us. Stay no more than ten meters away from us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I…” Ye Guyi wanted to retort, but Huo Yuhao had already pulled Wang Dong’er along with him as he charged forward. In addition, Wang Dong’er’s body lit up with one yellow, three purple, and two black soul rings. They were better than what was normally the best combination possible! Her bluish-gold butterfly wings opened up on her back, and a captivating glow rendered her even more ravishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hmph! I’m not inferior to her!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi unleashed her Holy Angel following the rise in her competitive spirit. While she was drained in her fight with Huo Yuhao, she had completely recovered when she was in the spectral demiplane. The place was filled with a spectral aura, but there was also a dense aura of light. However, it didn’t help her recover her soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she opened her four angel wings, Ye Guyi fluttered her feathery wings and chased after Huo Yuhao. There were white wings on one side, and bluish-gold wings on the other side. The three of them definitely formed a very dazzling lineup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Empire’s troops were already watching them from afar. Huo Yuhao lifted his head to peer into the sky. With his vision, he had already located a few surveillance soul tools in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold smile appeared on his lips. While these surveillance soul tools were effective against most people, they might not be effective against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange layer of spiritual undulations rippled from his body. Ye Guyi only saw his first, white soul ring shining before the light around them started to bend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was also inside, and thus she couldn’t see what changes were happening to her body. The only feeling that she got was that the light that both she and Wang Dong’er emitted dimmed down before it disappeared. Their surroundings also turned pitch-black. However, she could still see the bluish-gold from Wang Dong’er’s wings. She became very curious as she witnessed this strange scene occurring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she was astonished at the next moment. Huo Yuhao’s gentle spiritual power was transmitted over. As she thought he was trying to connect with her, she naturally accepted his spiritual power. However, Ye Guyi opened her eyes wide in shock following this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything around her became very clear in her mind. She could tell what was going for several square kilometers around her. She almost shouted out loud when she realized she had an all-around view of her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual power can be used in this way? Isn’t he an evil soul master? However, I can’t feel any evil aura from him now. On the contrary, there’s a very thick aura of light. What’s with this guy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi followed Huo Yuhao tightly as the questions piled up in her mind. Through his Spiritual Detection, he told her to follow him closely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, the three of them got close to the troops who were stationed to the west of Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi started to get a little nervous. Although the three of them were very strong, they were still outnumbered! Furthermore, the Sun Moon Empire’s military would still have some soul engineers, even if there was no real soul engineering team around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were trying to make their way into Radiant City. If they were discovered, they would be surrounded.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This guy doesn’t seem like an idiot, why is he doing something as foolish as this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she was shocked once again even before her doubts were answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soldiers didn’t seem to notice them at all. They didn’t react even though the three of them were getting closer and closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the soldiers weren’t able to see them at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had used his Imitation to hide from others on several occasions. It was even more effective at night. Unless one really tried to sense his aura, they wouldn’t be able to detect him using the naked eye. In addition, only soul masters that were superior in cultivation to him and certain special soul beasts would be able to sense his aura while he was concealed this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were able to charge past the troops into Radiant City openly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi stopped trying to guess what Huo Yuhao’s abilities were shortly thereafter. It was because she was more astonished by the dilapidated buildings and walls in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she looked at several of the collapsed building in front of her, as well as the fissures on the ground that snaked around everywhere, Ye Guyi couldn’t help but exclaim, “Is this really Radiant City? Why has it become like this?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up!” Huo Yuhao transmitted this message to her through his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Imitation couldn’t isolate sound!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is she trying to tell the troops where we are?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi also realized her mistake, but she was still dissatisfied as she snorted at Huo Yuhao, “Am I supposed to shut up just because you want me to?” While she was speaking again, she tried her best to lower her volume.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t have time to bother with her. Right now, he could sense that Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi were in a crisis. He quickened his footsteps and burst forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t choose to fly because he understood soul tools very well. The aerial surveillance soul tools in the air had very simple structures, as they were very large, and yet needed to remain in the air. However, the anti-air soul tools on the ground were different. He couldn’t hide from them even with his Imitation. The anti-air soul tools were aided by soul power detection soul tools. No matter what, Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly conceal his soul power undulations completely. Once they were discovered, they couldn’t possibly handle the barrage of attacks that would be unleashed against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi were indeed in a disastrous situation right now. They had been surrounded by their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bunch of soul engineers that had them surrounded. These soul engineers weren’t individually strong, the highest-ranked among them was only a Class 5 soul engineer. However, they had strength in numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least forty soul engineers had formed a loose circle, trapping the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul tools that were used were mainly Class 3 or Class 4. However, they were mainly used for rapid and long-range attacks. There were many rapid-fire cannons and explosive bombs that were targeting Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi. They weren’t given the opportunity to catch their breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fighting strength of soul engineers would greatly increase after they achieved a certain numerical advantage. That was what was happening with this bunch of soul engineers. They were from the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineering legion, and had great chemistry with one another. The soul tools that they used only exhausted their soul power, and didn’t drain any other resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi had been at their peak condition, they wouldn’t find it a problem to fight their way out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the two of them were critically injured during the Continental Elite Youth Soul Master Academy. Although they had received treatment in time, they were still far from fully recovered. After a series of fights, their injuries had relapsed. At this point, Xu Sanshi was using his Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle to protect Bei Bei. He tried to charge his way out a few times, but he was forced to retreat on every occasion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, a flashing red light silently appeared in the sky at this point. This ball of light very quickly locked onto Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an Eye of Fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they weren’t soul engineers, Bei Bei and He Caitou recognized what it was. During the tournament, He Caitou used an Eye of Fear to create many opportunities for their team to beat their opponents.</span></p>

It wasn’t a good feeling to be on the wrong side this time.</span></p>

I’ll fight all the way with them. Later, try to break out on your own when I unleash my full abilities. I can’t take care of her anymore. Ask her to find a good guy and marry him,” Xu Sanshi said to Bei Bei without any hesitation.</span></p>

I don’t think you can help me escape with your lacking abilities. I think you should get out of here. You’re more likely to escape with that turtle shell you’ve got. I’m more explosive than you.” In the face of this crisis, he was less refined than he normally was.</span></p>

Anyway, Nannan has always nursed a grievance against me. She won’t be too sad even if I die. You are different from me. You still have to save Xiao Ya! What will she do without you? Go on, get the Hell out of here! That Eye of Fear is about to finish charging.”</span></p>

A sonorous dragon roar reverberated through the nine heavens. It was a sign that meant the Radiant Holy Dragon was about to be unleashed.</span></p>

However, it was evident that he was going all-out by unleashing it now.</span></p>

However, Bei Bei now appeared very calm and refined. He was smiling as he looked at Xu Sanshi. The golden bolts of lightning that surged around him started to gradually turn into a light fog. Everything within a region of several tens of square meters turned a blinding gold. In a matter of seconds, lightning flashed within this region, which seemed to have transformed into a special world. The golden glow around Bei Bei started to combust like flames!</span></p>

His Radiant Holy Dragon was strong enough to increase his fighting strength significantly. By sacrificing his life energy, he made his fighting strength even more terrifying.</span></p>

He wanted to stop Bei Bei, but he was flung far away by a strong bolt of golden lightning!</span></p>
