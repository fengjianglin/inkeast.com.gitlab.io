 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of dazzling silver light fell from the sky and engulfed his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More than a quarter of his side of the stage was turned to dust and collapsed completely. The protective barriers on this side of the stage surged with blinding light. The more than twenty soul engineers who were maintaining the protective barrier all spat blood at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pair of bronze palm prints were still present on the ground that had caved in. The area that was struck was completely smooth and appeared worked by someone with splendid carving skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only two spots within this area hadn’t caved in. Wang Yanfeng was in one of the spots, while Zheng Zhan, who had used his silver-colored protective barrier to protect Wang Yanfeng, was in the other spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Zhan’s arms were still shaking gently. He was horrified, but it wasn’t obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Titled Douluo, he should have been able to easily restrain a Soul Emperor. However, those palms made him finally understand why the Body Sect was so strong. Zheng Zhan knew that it would be impossible for him to unleash such a strong palm strike without any soul tools even if he had eight rings. Even soul masters who specialized in cultivating martial souls might not be so terrifying when they unleashed their Martial Soul True Body with seven rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the strength of a body soul!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was seated in his wheelchair in the air. He slowly landed with the Snow Lady’s help. He seemed very relaxed, and didn’t even pull out his Milk Bottle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng hadn’t seen what had happened, but Zheng Zhan had witnessed everything clearly. Huo Yuhao had only taken his Milk Bottle out earlier. He didn’t suck any soul power from the bottle. He had not been far from Huo Yuhao earlier, as he had been preparing to save the crippled young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Milk Bottle had unleashed a light that made it look like soul power was being absorbed from it. However, there weren’t any soul power undulations from that light. Was it a smokescreen or illusion?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Wang Yanfeng still couldn’t believe that he had lost. However, he knew that he couldn’t have blocked his own attack. He would have been critically injured even if he didn’t die. There wasn’t any way he could compete in the team round after this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As an elite from the younger generation of Body Sect disciples, he had actually lost to a Soul King! It was even a Soul King who was crippled! He was even more embarrassed that his opponent was from Shrek Academy. It was important to know that the Body Sect and Shrek Academy had many disputes with one another!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Embarrassing. It was too embarrassing...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng lowered his head in shame. He quickly rushed off the stage, and didn’t even say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wore a smile as he sat back in his wheelchair. The light from his Milk Bottle appeared once again. This time, he was really sucking the soul power from the Milk Bottle to restore his own soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t just win this physical fight. More importantly, he achieved a psychological and tactical victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had wanted to give his opponents the impression that he was willing to fight until the end against them. Both parties had clashed a few times with one another, and Wang Yanfeng couldn’t help but feel that Huo Yuhao was really strong. The rest of the changes were all within Huo Yuhao’s calculations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used his Imitation to tempt his opponent into unleashing an all-out attack. It was also his first time using the fifth soul skill of his Spirit Eyes, Spiritual Duplication. It was the strong soul skill that he obtained when he was in the Great Star Dou Forest with Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious what soul skill he had duplicated from the effects of it. It was Xu Sanshi’s Mysterious Underworld Displacement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This divine skill from a defense-type soul master achieved the same divine effects even when he used it. No matter how well the Snowdemon Sect knew him, they couldn’t have guessed he had such a skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yanfeng was the one who bore the consequences of his own attack. In fact, Wang Yanfeng had a wealth of live experience. It was a pity that he wasn’t cunning enough to best Huo Yuhao. Bound to his wheelchair, Huo Yuhao was too deceptive. His greatest advantage wasn’t any overwhelming ability, but the complexity of the types of abilities he possessed. He could use a myriad of fighting strategies against his opponents!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Wang Dong’er truly understood everything when she finished watching this fight. Only she understood that the core of Huo Yuhao’s abilities came from his Spirit Eyes, even though he had used so many soul skills! All his planning had revolved around his Spirit Eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tang Sect versus the Snowdemon Sect. The Tang Sect wins the first individual elimination round,” Zheng Zhan announced the result, watching Huo Yuhao carefully. Huo Yuhao gave him a very weird feeling…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Down in the waiting area, Wei Na’s astonishment slowly faded away. She nodded slightly, and her eyes flashed. She whispered a few words to her teammates before another young man jumped onto the stage. He quickly walked out to the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As this was an individual elimination round, the stage couldn’t be repaired, as that would give the victorious soul master the time needed to restore his soul power and energy. The tournament could only continue. At most, some simple repairs could be made before the team round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both parties, please report your names.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tang Sect, Huo Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snowdemon Sect, Chen Lu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The members of the Snowdemon Sect were all glaring at Huo Yuhao, as if they were trying to figure out something about him. Huo Yuhao appeared as leisurely as ever, as if nothing had happened at all. His aura also hadn’t changed because of the previous fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both parties quickly retreated to their respective sides of the stage. Huo Yuhao was still holding his Milk Bottle in his hand, and seemed to have no intention of putting it away. However, he didn’t delay the fight either. He pressed three of the fingers of his right hand against his Milk Bottle before turning his wheelchair around. It was a pretty sad sight. The spectators weren’t too hostile either, since the Sun Moon team had already been eliminated. They pitied him a little as they saw him in this state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned around as he reached his side of the stage. Only he knew that the previous victory hadn’t come easily. Wang Yanfeng was indeed very strong. The Soul Emperors of the Body Sect weren’t inferior to Soul Emperors like Ma Xiaotao from Shrek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when Huo Yuhao was in his normal condition, he still had to give his all in order to beat such an opponent with his cultivation as a Soul King. Moreover, he was in a very deprived state right now. His greatest advantage was that his opponents didn’t know him well. They also didn’t know about the enhancement to his spiritual power that he had received after he went to the Icefire Yin Yang Well and ended up in his current disabled state. Indeed, his Spirit Eyes were the core of all his fighting strategies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin!” the Unbreakable Douluo shouted, announcing the start of the second individual elimination round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lu crouched down before jumping forward. He was very quick, like an arrow loosed from a bow. He stuck close to the ground as he raced towards Huo Yuhao. Everyone was impressed by his speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His speed was different from Wang Qiu’er’s speed, which was generated from her explosive power. His speed came from his extremely great leaping abilities. When he came up onto the stage, Huo Yuhao had immediately realized his legs were different from those of normal people, they were more muscular and developed. His calves were so thick that they were almost the size of a regular person’s thighs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he leapt forward, he immediately demonstrated his shocking springing ability. He was in front of Huo Yuhao almost instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sliding tackle! Against the immobile Huo Yuhao, Chen Lu chose an offensive method that was difficult to anticipate. Just as he was about to reach Huo Yuhao, he leaned back and kicked forward with his legs, one high and one low as he slid in. He wasn’t targeting Huo Yuhao, but his wheelchair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a brilliant tactic. Zheng Zhan’s eyes brightened. Even though Chen Lu’s attack was a little despicable, Zheng Zhan had to admit that it was effective.</span></p>

He already found it very difficult to move. Without his wheelchair, his fighting strength would fall considerably. Even though Chen Lu had five soul rings just like Huo Yuhao, he seemed to have found the key to victory the moment he entered the fray.</span></p>

Otherwise, he would lose his only form of mobility if his wheelchair was damaged. There wasn’t going to be any way for him to face his opponent then.</span></p>

What method was Huo Yuhao going to use to deal with his opponent?</span></p>

It seemed like he had no intention of stopping his opponent. Chen Lu was very quick, and was about to strike the wheelchair...</span></p>

He was already prepared: if Huo Yuhao tried to stop him, he would unleash all his strength and destroy the wheelchair no matter the price. Once he did that, victory was almost certain!</span></p>

He slapped the side of his chair using his right hand, and his wheelchair flew into the air. At the same time, his wheelchair slid diagonally to one side.</span></p>

However, Huo Yuhao and his wheelchair seemed to fuse with the air as they dodged. They disappeared without a sound…</span></p>

Chen Lu was shocked. He even forgot to retract his power, and only reacted after sliding more than ten meters. He pointed his toes to the ground before leaping up again. However, he couldn’t trace Huo Yuhao after he turned around.</span></p>
