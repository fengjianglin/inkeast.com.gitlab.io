 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky suddenly darkened before light exploded through the air. Frightening soul power undulations rippled high in the sky as all the clouds and mist within several hundred square kilometers in the sky dissipated. However, not a single ray of sunlight peeked through the sky; all that could be seen were yellow and purplish-black colors resisting each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That terrifying yet magnificent aura shocked everyone watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City and the Sun Moon Empire’s great army were all watching this earth-shaking sight, but there were very few who truly understood what all that meant. However, everyone was aware that this battle was very important for Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu arrived quietly next to Ju Zi and whispered, “When do we attack, commander?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi shook her head gently and said, “Now is not the time. We’ll wait until the battle is decided. We have to wait and see. Imperial Tutor, I wish to ask you something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? Ask.” Zhongli Wu turned towards Ju Zi confusedly. The War God Empress would seldom ask questions humbly, from what he remembered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi lowered her voice and said, “From your perspective, how large a threat do you think the Beast God is to us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s a very large threat.” Zhongli Wu replied almost without hesitation. “The Beast God is known as the most powerful in the individual in the world. The Great Star Dou Forest has a cornerstone with him around, and no matter who wishes to hunt soul beasts inside the Great Star Dou Forest, they will have to be very careful. That includes my mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi smiled faintly and said, “Unfortunately, you already have your ninth soul ring. Otherwise, perhaps this would be a good opportunity to hunt and kill him. If somebody can obtain the Beast God as his soul ring, perhaps that person will take over as the strongest in the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu had never expected Ju Zi to say something like this, and he was momentarily taken aback.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking the Beast God as my soul ring?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not even he had considered something like this. In other words, unless soul masters were insane, nobody would ever consider that possibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But that was the Beast God, Di Tian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Human desire was endless, and humans were greedy. Zhongli Wu hadn’t thought about that before Ju Zi brought it up. But when she spoke of that possibility, his heart immediately burned with passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A soul ring won’t be possible. But if I turn part of the Beast God’s spirit and part of his original body into a puppet…” Avarice and greed chewed at Zhongli Wu’s heart like a million little maggots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commander, I don’t need Di Tian as a soul ring. I would rather give it to the Emperor if that’s possible. The Holy Ghost Church’s secret methods, in combination with our soul engineers’ most advanced soul tools, can likely preserve the Beast God’s soul ring for a long time. The Emperor has already become a Titled Douluo, but the crown prince hasn’t! Furthermore, the Beast God won’t just produce a soul ring. He will definitely produce a soul bone. If we leave his soul ring and his soul bone for the crown prince, the crown prince shall become the most powerful individual in the world in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi felt a tingle in her heart as she listened to his words. But she quickly recovered as she laughed coldly inside. She was trying to bait him, but he turned her words around and tried to bait her instead.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God’s soul ring? Hmph, his soul ring may not even be suitable for my son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Ju Zi was clear that her son couldn’t possibly have a dragon-type martial soul like Xu Tianran did. Furthermore, Di Tian’s element was darkness, while his soul ring would undoubtedly be incredibly powerful. There was a very low chance that his soul ring would be suitable for her son.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, her face revealed eagerness and passion even as those thoughts ran through her head. “I’m afraid that’s not ideal, Imperial Tutor. The most valuable parts of the Beast God are his soul ring and his soul bone. How can we give them to the royal family? If we wish to kill the Beast God, we need your support, Imperial Tutor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu smiled faintly and said, “You don’t have to be polite, commander. We’ll just take what we both need. I just want the Beast God’s corpse, and the royal family has no use for it anyway. His corpse will be much more useful if you are to give it to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi answered without hesitation, “If we can really kill the Beast God, we will have accomplished a great feat, and we will all benefit. We’ll do everything according to your will, Imperial Tutor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu clenched his fists subconsciously. He knew very well what would happen if he could obtain the Beast God’s corpse. He only had to preserve part of the Beast God’s spirit, and he could craft a puppet out of the Golden Eyes Black Dragon King. He would become the most powerful individual in the world with the Beast God’s physical strength! He could even rely on this puppet to directly break through to become an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Zhongli Wu was also very shrewd and calculative. He was extremely excited in his heart, but his expression didn’t reveal anything as he said, “We cannot be hasty if we wish to fight the Beast God. We have to wait for the best opportunity to strike, and hope that Elder Xuan can severely injure him. The best outcome is if Elder Xuan himself dies at the Beast God’s hands. We can kill two birds with one stone if that happens. Don’t worry, commander. The Holy Ghost Church will not hold back when the time comes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi replied, “Alright, I will command all the soul tool fronts’ offensive soul tools to cooperate with you. Let’s just keep waiting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu contemplated momentarily before he said, “This matter is extremely important, Commander. Let me go and make some preparations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, do as you wish, Imperial Tutor.” Ju Zi hurriedly replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu left, and he took the Holy Ghost Church’s evil soul masters with him as they swiftly turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile appeared on Ju Zi’s face as he watched their backs, but her smile was charged with cold murderousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ll have to wish you good luck then, Imperial Tutor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Su suddenly appeared beside Ju Zi and asked softly, “Commander, are we really helping the Holy Ghost Church obtain the Beast God’s corpse?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi smiled plainly and said, “Of course, as long as we can kill the Beast God.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Su was shocked for a moment before a thin smile quickly appeared on his face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a fantastic scheme to kill two birds with one stone! The commander lives up to her name after all. She’s set a trap for the Holy Ghost Church in such a short period of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This tremendous temptation was undoubtedly the best bait for the greedy Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two silhouettes separated in the sky as Elder Xuan retreated all the way between his Godly Taotie Bull’s two horns before he stabilized himself. The Beast God’s formidable strength was on full display in this moment, as he was just pushed back a little more than ten meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s face turned a little red as he felt his heart pulsing with fear. The Beast God wasn’t known as the world’s most powerful individual for nothing, and his strength exceeded his expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he clashed with the Beast God, all he could feel was how deep Di Tian’s power was. Elder Xuan could feel almost no end to Di Tian’s strength, and his frightening strength instantly vaporized his attack. Furthermore, Di Tian seemed to be holding back, and that was the reason why Elder Xuan could retreat in one piece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should be able to tell, Xuan Zi, that you are still too far from me. Go, bring Huo Yuhao out. I only wish to ask him a few questions. I won’t do anything to him. I don’t wish to kill you.” Di Tian said plainly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan grunted coldly and said, “Don’t think you’ve won.” He took a step forward as he spoke, and the Godly Taotie Bull behind him growled deeply. Elder Xuan disappeared into thin air just like that, and the bull’s initially illusory figure grew material.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Elder Xuan’s martial soul true body, Godly Taotie Bull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heavens and the earth, darkness and soil were in conflict, but the element of earth’s power was being completely suppressed. It couldn’t go higher than a hundred meters above the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Godly Taotie Bull’s long horns glowed with circles of yellow light before the bull suddenly accelerated and charged right at the Golden Eyes Black Dragon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bull charged crazily as rolling thunder seemed to boom through the heavens. Frightening explosions could be heard, like the entire sky was being trampled apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Circles of yellow light expanded beneath the bull’s feet and covered the Golden Eyes Black Dragon King’s body. It was controlling gravity, and tremendous gravity tore at the Golden Eyes Black Dragon King’s body in an attempt to arrest it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian heaved a sigh and said, “Since you wish to die, I will give you a lesson that you will never forget.” He turned around as he spoke, and pressed his right hand against the Black Dragon King’s head before he wheeled his arms into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange sight occurred as the enormous Black Dragon King that was more than a thousand meters long began to concentrate towards Di tian’s wheeling right arm like a whale sucking in water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s arm had just wheeled over his head when a large sword appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sword’s hilt was three feet long, and the blade was eight feet long. The hilt was black, and resembled a black dragon. The blade was dark purple, and the terrifying sword intent seemed to tear an enormous hole in the sky when the sword appeared. Enormous circles of black light appeared behind Di Tian’s back, and it was like a black hole that seemed to swallow everything.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen shook his head softly, but there was determination in his eyes. Only he knew what had just happened. In that moment, he used his own sword intent to feel Di Tian’s sword intent, and that was the reason why that had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such formidable sword intent. Is this the sword intent that belongs to the most powerful individual in the world? His sword intent is his own martial soul, and it’s also his overwhelming and domineering will. And… and that frightening strength.</span></p>

This moment’s revelation was far too important for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen had been stuck as a Soul Douluo for a long time, and couldn’t break through at all, because there was no way he could form his own soul core. Ji Juechen’s cultivation method was different from everyone, and he had to find the path that belonged to him alone if he wished to become a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
