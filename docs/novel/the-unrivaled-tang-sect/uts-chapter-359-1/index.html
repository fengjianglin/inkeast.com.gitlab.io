Against the unknown, he naturally chose to control the other party. As for whether Huo Yuhao’s words were true or false, he had to capture him first before interrogating him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest of the White Tiger bodyguards didn’t move. Only the four bodyguards leaped towards Huo Yuhao at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sighed in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s really not easy convincing him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was his first time interacting with the White Tiger Duke. At this moment, he had mixed feelings. He had only managed to keep his calm, and say everything he had said earlier through willpower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four special guards unleashed their martial souls. Three of them were Soul Emperors, and the last one was a Soul Sage. They were quite strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Soul Sage was the first to charge towards Huo Yuhao. He had three yellow, three purple, and one black soul ring. It was a decent combination of soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, an indescribable, terrifying aura surged towards him when he was ten meters away from Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that instant, the Soul Sage felt as if he was facing the king of soul beasts. The all-engulfing suppression left him very stifled, and his forward momentum stalled. He was horrified to discover that the soul rings of the mysterious White Tiger bodyguard on the other side were rising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two yellow, two purple, four black and one red soul ring. There were nine soul rings. There were actually nine soul rings. The most terrifying thing was that the last soul ring out of these nine was a blood-red, hundred-thousand year soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hundred-thousand year soul ring only existed in legends, even in the world of soul masters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who had gone through orthodox soul master education would know that a hundred-thousand year soul beast possessed high intelligence. It could even choose to be reborn as a human! It was extremely difficult to hunt and kill a hundred-thousand year soul beast. Not only must one possess great abilities, but he must also be lucky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a Titled Douluo faced a hundred-thousand year soul beast, the Titled Douluo was slightly more likely to win if their cultivations were similar. However, this was under the premise that the soul beast didn’t hail from the one of the stronger species. While it might be possible for a Titled Douluo to defeat a hundred-thousand year soul beast, killing and capturing it was much more difficult. A soul beast that could survive for a hundred-thousand years or achieve a cultivation of a hundred-thousand years possessed great survival abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, hundred-thousand year soul beasts were getting rarer and rarer as time went on. They were very aware that soul masters hunted them. As a result, most of the hundred-thousand year soul beasts hid in special habitats. Those habitats were like their worlds. A soul master who tried to venture into these habitats was likely to die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this person that had hidden himself among the White Tiger bodyguards actually possessed a hundred-thousand year soul ring. The terrifying aura earlier was also unleashed through the hundred-thousand year soul ring. It was too scary, a complete suppression in terms of rank and cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other three special guards naturally stopped in the air. The Dragonscale Horses that the surrounding bodyguards were on all screamed tragically before they collapsed to the ground. They were all soul beasts that had only been alive for a few decades, and couldn’t resist the aura of a hundred-thousand year soul beast. They could even be frightened to death by a hundred-thousand year soul beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the White Tiger Colt underneath the White Tiger Duke remained standing. However, on a closer look, Huo Yuhao could see that the White Tiger Duke was releasing dim-white soul power over his White Tiger Colt. Against Huo Yuhao’s aura, this soul beast that had close to a ten-thousand year cultivation was still greatly suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke’s expression turned serious. He hadn’t expected a Titled Douluo with a hundred-thousand year soul ring to be hiding among his bodyguards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, he was also stunned to realize that he couldn’t even the tell the age of the other party. This was the first time something like this had happened to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” Dai Hao asked. He was much more aware of what a hundred-thousand year soul ring meant compared to his special guards. A hundred-thousand year soul ring was a stepping stone to becoming a Transcendent Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, it was very difficult for a Titled Douluo to advance in rank after they reached Rank 90. Most Titled Douluo would fail to become a Rank 95 Transcendent Douluo. Only those who were extremely gifted, intelligent, and fortunate enough had such an opportunity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were some Titled Douluo who were exceptions. As long as they continued cultivating and persisted until they made breakthroughs, they could become Transcendent Douluo. These Titled Douluo possessed a hundred-thousand year soul ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No form of medicine or strength could compare to a hundred-thousand year soul ring in terms of enhancing a soul master’s body. It made a soul master capable of handling the soul power of a Transcendent Douluo, and adjusted his gifts until he reached such a level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely because he knew all this that Dai Hao didn’t think the person in front of him was only a Titled Douluo. He clearly knew that someone who possessed a hundred-thousand year soul ring could possibly be a Transcendent Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hundred-thousand year soul ring was a top-ranked treasure that all soul masters coveted. However, it also represented huge trouble. A hundred-thousand year soul ring couldn’t be stripped off a soul master, but a hundred-thousand year soul beast would still produce hundred-thousand year soul bones! As long as a soul master was dead, his soul bones could still be snatched away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, other Titled Douluo might be tempted to kill someone with a hundred-thousand year soul ring in a bid to snatch their soul bones!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why soul masters with a hundred-thousand year soul ring would try to increase their abilities to the level of a Transcendent Douluo if they didn’t have sufficient protection around themselves. In this way, they could protect themselves from being pursued and killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I can’t challenge a Transcendent Douluo on my own!,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao quickly realized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt a little helpless right now. He had had no choice but to use his Imitation to make himself seem this impressive. Otherwise, how could he stop the White Tiger Duke from attacking him, and make him listen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One’s abilities always had the biggest say in the world of soul masters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to care who I am. You should be able to sense that I don’t have any ill intentions towards you. Otherwise, I could have attacked you whenever I wanted. I didn’t have to wait until now, or give you any warning. I specialize in spiritual power, thus I can sense that a huge crisis is waiting for you somewhere not too far away. If you believe me and quickly turn back, you can still make it. Otherwise, you won’t be able to handle whatever’s trying to deal with you. Turn around immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used the simplest way to tell him what his intention was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin was among the bodyguards right now. When he saw Huo Yuhao on his Dragonscale Horse, revealing the aura of a Transcendent Douluo, he was in awe. He thought to himself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow is still the same as ever. His ability to scare others is greater than whatever other abilities he possesses! Didn’t he do the same to us in the past? However, he is making it seem so real that my father doesn’t even realize it...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Huo Yuhao was using his immense, concrete-immaterial spiritual power under the guise of his Imitation to pose as a Transcendent Douluo. It wasn’t just that Dai Hao didn’t discover anything, even Elder Xuan wouldn’t be able to tell anything unless he was close enough to him. For the White Tiger Duke, he wouldn’t be able to tell unless he really fought Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao squinted and said, “How do I know this is not another trap? Why should I believe you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t make a sound, but he suddenly lifted his head to look into the sky. His senses were very acute; they weren’t inferior to Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon’s Perception. His judgment on danger had always been very accurate. When he lifted his head, golden light shot out of his eyes. His spiritual power was already focused in one direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On a flat ground, Huo Yuhao’s unidirectional detection could reach out close to five thousand meters. He could cover an even longer distance in the air, as there weren’t any obstacles.</span></p>

His terrifying spiritual power was even greater than the White Tiger Duke’s spiritual power! Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was even on the verge of turning material as he unleashed it!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is his cultivation? Transcendent Douluo, this person must be a Transcendent Douluo! However, I’ve never heard of any Transcendent Douluo with a spiritual-type martial soul on the continent! Has this guy been hiding all this while?</span></p>

When he unleashed his spiritual power into the air, his expression immediately changed, and he shouted, “Quickly, give the order to retreat! There are surveillance-type soul tools deployed in the air by your enemies. They are observing your every move. If you suddenly stop, they’ll be alerted, and they’ll come for you! Quickly, retreat!”</span></p>

Furthermore, there were Titled Douluo following the White Tiger Duke, given how important he was to the Star Luo Empire. It was just that these Titled Douluo usually remained hidden. This time, he hadn’t even brought any of them with him. As long as he could return to his military base, his safety would be assured!</span></p>
