 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The establishment of the new Shrek City caused Shrek Academy to be situated in the center. Shrek Academy’s Soul Tool Department and Martial Soul Department were both expanded. The Soul Tool Department and the Tang Sect’s Soul Tool Hall established close connections with each other, with the Soul Tool Department sending many talents to the Soul Tool Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was morning now, all the students were in class. When the two of them walked into the academy, the entire academy was quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They crossed Sea God’s Lake and came to Sea God’s Island. The moment they landed on the island, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong saw someone familiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were very obvious as they flew across the lake. That person naturally saw them too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Tong? How are you? It’s been awhile.” Huo Yuhao greeted her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That familiar person was Su Tong, who possessed the Icesky Snow Lady and demonstrated her Ultimate Ice abilities during the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, she was also slightly stunned. She was very pretty, and possessed the Icesky Snow Lady. Furthermore, she had a very elegant and cold aura about her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she heard Huo Yuhao’s greeting, she only nodded at him, but didn’t say anything. She turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong covered her mouth and laughed. She said, “It seems like she still hates you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “It’s also a problem to be too handsome. Are you very proud of yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong twisted her lips and replied, “I don’t think so. When I was dressed like a guy back then, where were you? Why couldn’t I see that you were handsome?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled and replied, “Whether a guy is handsome can only be judged by a lady. The number one beauty in this world has already chosen me and become my wife. Doesn’t this mean I’m the most handsome guy in this world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong rolled her eyes and wanted to retort, but couldn’t really argue. “Since when did you become so thick-skinned?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “I’ve been tortured by your seal every day. If I wasn’t thick-skinned enough, I would have been disfigured by now, don’t you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong laughed and said, “Stop acting pitiful. Let’s quickly go, and not make Elder Xuan and the rest wait for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao walked into the Sea God’s Pavilion, the long table in the main hall of the Sea God’s Pavilion was already fully seated. Apart from Huo Yuhao, the rest of the members of the Sea God’s Pavilion were present. Bei Bei was also one step ahead of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was in the main seat. It didn’t seem like his appearance had changed at all. However, Huo Yuhao could still subtly feel something different about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to before, his aura seemed to be much gentler and calmer. No soul power or spiritual undulations could be sensed from him. He seemed like an ordinary old man. Even his eyes appeared ordinary. However, his eyes couldn’t be so clear if he was just an ordinary old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, you’re here. Come, take a seat. Wutong, take a seat too.” Elder Xuan smiled as he nodded at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only now that Huo Yuhao realized that there were two empty seats. It turned out that there was an extra chair beside his seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to know that the circular table represented the Sea God’s Pavilion, even though it only seemed like an ordinary table. Only members of the Sea God’s Pavilion were fit to sit around this table!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao were the two existing Tang Sect disciples who were part of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Bei Bei represented the Tang Sect, while Huo Yuhao had earned his position because of his contributions to the academy. What about Tang Wutong? What did it mean that she had a seat today? Did it mean that the Tang Sect had another member in the Sea God’s Pavilion?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Tang Wutong had restored her memories, she had naturally returned to the Tang Sect. She was a member of Shrek’s Seven Monsters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt weird. Naturally, Tang Wutong had the same feeling. However, the two of them quickly sat down. They were already late. Therefore, they didn’t dare to waste everyone’s time any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan looked at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong and said, “Don’t the both of you feel weird? There’s actually nothing to feel weirded out by. That Qiankun Fortune Pill was enough to earn the Tang Sect another seat here. Furthermore, the Tang Sect has been getting stronger day after day over the past few years. The sect complements the academy. It’s only right that we increase the number of allocations of seats to the sect. Wutong, you are the first member of the Tang Sect to become a Titled Douluo. You shall take this seat temporarily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was guessing earlier, Huo Yuhao could confirm it now. He immediately said with surprise, “Elder Xuan, have you succeeded?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan smiled and there was a comforted look in his eyes. He answered, “I’ve finally overcome the last stage. It wasn’t easy! This bottleneck has been troubling me for years. I can’t even count how long I’ve been stuck. However, I’ve learned many things from this experience. It’s a step to heaven. No wonder it was so difficult.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted. “Congratulations, Elder Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan waved his hand and said, “I feel a little regretful when I think of it. Such a magical pill like the Qiankun Fortune Pill shouldn’t be wasted on an old man like me. It should be given to younger people like the two of you. Alright, I won’t dwell on this. We’ll get to our main topic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Before both of you came, we’d already voted, and decided that a new seat shall be given to the Tang Sect. Apart from you, we’ve already agreed on that through voting. Let’s get to the topic of our discussion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted. He turned his gaze to Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er. The two of them also appeared much more vibrant. They had also benefited greatly from more than a year of closed-door cultivation. Given Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er’s original cultivation, an increase of just one rank in their cultivation was still a massive increase. At the tier of a Transcendent Douluo, one rank was one entire level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “The Sun Moon Empire hasn’t made a move over the past two years. They are so quiet I’m a little afraid. However, they’ve sealed all information even more tightly than before. Almost all their borders are covered with aerial surveillance soul tools. The three empires of the original Douluo Continent have exhausted all the means at their disposal, but they’ve not gotten any concrete information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xu Tianran is very ambitious. His disability has also made him an anti-hero. Not long ago, ambassadors from the three empires came together and invited us to join them on a mission. They didn’t reveal any details, but they said it was targeted at the Sun Moon Empire’s Radiant City. They hope we can send someone strong to join them. Everyone, please tell me what you think.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er asked, “Elder Xuan, what’s their goal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “Assassinate Xu Tianran. Their reason is also very good. Xu Tianran only succeeded the throne not long ago, but he’s already invading other empires. He’s also achieved outstanding results. If Yuhao didn’t help the Star Luo Empire regain control of the Ming Dou Mountain Range, I’m afraid bigger problems would have surfaced. Furthermore, Xu Tianran’s position in the Sun Moon Empire has also stabilized through this war. He’s gotten rid of all his enemies, including his brothers that fought with him for the position of Emperor. He’s very brutal, but he’s effective. He’s aggressively developing offensive soul tools. We’ve been accumulating our strength over the past two years, but the Sun Moon Empire has been doing the same. I believe they’ll attack on all fronts again in the future. This time, they’ll be even more powerful than before, and we’ll have a harder time resisting them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan paused for a moment as he spoke until here. Then, he said, “From this assassination plan, we can tell that the three empires have also detected this danger that’s brewing. This is why they’ve decided to make a move. Assassinating Xu Tianran won’t be easy. He’s bound to be surrounded by powerful individuals. However, the mission has already been put into motion. It can’t be stopped anymore. Not many people will be involved, but they are all very strong. They didn’t come here in the belief that we’ll definitely help them. After all, we are still a neutral force, since there’s no war. They only hope to borrow one person from us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Borrow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the members of the Sea God’s Pavilion were shocked when they heard the word ‘borrow’. They were here to borrow one person? Who was that person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Huo Yuhao revealed a bitter smile when he heard Elder Xuan’s words. The rest couldn’t guess, but how could he not? It was indeed not good to be overly famous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was very famous among ordinary soul masters, he rarely appeared. However, who didn’t know how effective he was?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without his surveillance and help, the Star Luo Empire wouldn’t have regained control of the Ming Dou Mountain Range. It was also his penetration that greatly weakened the Sun Moon Empire’s frontline army. Without even mentioning the rest, his concealment and ability to resist aerial surveillance soul tools was highly looked upon by the three empires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao guessed it. So did Bei Bei and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, Huo Yuhao didn’t want to leave this time. He was stuck at Rank 89. It had been almost a year. He had been working very hard to try to reach the next rank, but he couldn’t do it. Furthermore, Tang Wutong was back at his side. He had already started to like this peaceful life over the past two years. He really didn’t want to take a risk now that he had a loved one by his side.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lowered his head and said, “If the academy wants me to go, I’ll go. I’ll listen to the instructions of the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan smiled and said, “Don’t you like to torture yourself? Why do you look so forced now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted his head, and appeared calm again. He smiled and replied, “I’m not! However, Elder Xuan, can you consider this my graduation test if I leave this time?”</span></p>
