 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong> Chapter 8.4: Monstrous Teacher</strong></p>
 <p>Zhou Yi still had a smile on her face. “But I never said that you wouldn’t need to run! School has only just started, yet you’ve already fought with your roommate. You two really have future prospects. Thus, since you two have so many future prospects, the difficulty of your test should be harder than that of the other’s. Moreover, you two of you should share both delight and hardship with your fellow students. The amount of time you two have to finish those one hundred laps will be the same as the others. Look, a moment has already passed while you two weren’t being careful!”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong still wanted to say something, but he was pulled away by Huo Yuhao, who didn’t hesitate to turn around and run outside.</p>
 <p>Although Wang Dong felt somewhat depressed, he still followed Huo Yuhao out to run. “What’d you pull me away for? This ‘Teacher Zhou’ is truly a lunatic.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao unhappily replied, “Can you beat her in a verbal battle? Can you beat her in a fight? If you can’t do either of these things, and you still want to stay in Shrek Academy, then you’ll have to follow her orders. Quickly run, I believe that her earlier words about expelling anyone who’s unable to finish a hundred laps aren’t false at all.”</p>
 <p>Shrek Plaza was right outside the freshman school building. It wasn’t considered too big; a single lap was roughly three hundred metres or so. To normal people, running a hundred laps around the plaza was definitely not a simple task. However, to these young students who had the foundation of a soul master, it wasn’t actually that hard. As long as they ran seriously, they’d manage to finish running their hundred laps within two hours.</p>
 <p>After Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had joined the ‘great army’ of running, many sounds of schadenfreude immediately echoed out. However, the two people didn’t even bother to care about them. They were already behind by fifteen minutes, so they had to make the most of every minute that they had.</p>
 <p>Whilst running, Wang Dong suddenly asked Huo Yuhao, “What skill did you use to beat me that day? I still haven’t been able to figure it out. Could it be that your martial soul is a spiritual-type martial soul?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was stunned, “It’s really a spiritual-type martial soul! No wonder I couldn’t see what your martial soul was after you’d used your soul ring. At least my loss can’t be considered too much of an injustice.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt slightly helpless as he replied, “You’re too arrogant. If you’d also used your martial soul, I would’ve definitely had no chance at all. I can sense that your soulforce is much stronger than mine.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was slightly pleased as he said, “That’s obvious. Amongst this year’s freshmen, the number of students who can compare with me in terms of strength are as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. You merely have a single ten year soul ring, thus you’re naturally not my opponent.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao disliked Wang Dong’s arrogant appearance. “Don’t forget that you just lost to that ‘ten year soul ring’.”</p>
 <p>“Ugh…” Wang Dong unhappily replied, “I get it, let’s not talk about this anymore. Seeing that you protected me in front of that perverted teacher, I’ll consider the previous matter settled. In the future, I’ll take care of you. If anyone wants to bully you, I’ll protect you.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was left speechless. “I don’t need your protection.” After saying this, he sped up his pace and ran forward.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong followed Huo Yuhao as he sped up. The physical fitness of his body was much better than Huo Yuhao’s, so keeping up with his increase in speed was effortless to him.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was slightly dissatisfied as he said, “You’re too unreasonable!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao glared at him and replied, “If you’d treat me as a student on equal terms, you wouldn’t have to have this kind of feeling.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong curled his lip. “Since I was young, there’s never been someone the same age as me who was able to make me treat them as an equal.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao humphed, and stopped looking at him. “When words get sour, adding extra words is meaningless.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong also stopped talking. He suddenly sped up, overtaking Huo Yuhao as he used an astonishing speed to run around Shrek Plaza.</p>
 <p>It had to be said that even though Wang Dong was arrogant, his cultivation truly stood out from the masses. Furthermore, his physical fitness was extremely strong. Once he’d sped up, there was no one from Class 1 who could actually catch up to him.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Zhou Yi had already arrived beside Shrek Plaza. She simply stood there as she calmly watched the students run. Her gaze was quickly attracted to Wang Dong, and her gaze changed slightly before returning to normal.</p>
 <p>Time quickly passed. As the number of completed laps increased, the breathing of the running students gradually became rougher. The physical fitness and cultivation level of the students was revealed at this moment. Zhou Yi had never said that they were prohibited from using the assistance of soulforce, so everyone had started using soulforce to recover their physical strength in order to continue their long-distance running.</p>
 <p>There were more than ten people running at the very front of the group; their speed wasn’t slow at all. Of the group, the leader was Wang Dong. Although he’d come out late, he’d managed to catch up to the people who had the most laps completed within an hour. He’d even overtaken them. Just looking at his appearance, he didn’t seem to have used up much energy; his speed hadn’t decreased at all the entire time.</p>
 <p>After the people at the front of the class, there was a large group of students. There were at least seventy students within this group, and they all ran at a relatively even speed. Running didn’t seem to be too exhausting for them. Looking at their speed, it wouldn’t be a problem for them to complete a hundred laps within their two allotted hours.</p>
 <p>Behind them were still more than ten students who’d been left behind in the back. Huo Yuhao was amongst this group. For the sake of catching up to the students in front, Huo Yuhao had used a very quick speed to start running as soon as he’d started. However, the drain on his physical strength had started increasing as soon as he finished running twenty or so laps. Not only was he the last person in the class, the number of laps that he’d run was even fewer than the others, due to him having started fifteen minutes later.</p>
 <p>More than half of the total time had already passed when Zhou Yi’s voice suddenly echoed out in everyone’s ears, “Speed up and use my location as the finishing point.”</p>
 <p>In the middle of her speaking, Wang Dong had swept past her with a “swoosh”, becoming the first person to complete the hundred laps.</p>
 <p>After using an extremely fast speed to finish the hundred laps, Wang Dong’s handsome face had also turned rosy. He panted slightly as he slowed his pace, and he finally stopped after he’d walked another lap around the plaza.</p>
 <p>Gradually, more and more students began to complete their hundred laps after Wang Dong. At this moment, there were still fifteen minutes left until the two hours were up.</p>
 <p>After Wang Dong stopped, his gaze quickly landed on Huo Yuhao, who was running at the back. He couldn’t help but furrow his brow as he muttered to himself, “How did I lose to him...?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s speed had already become much slower than his starting speed. His school uniform was soaked with sweat, and since his martial soul was a spiritual-type martial soul, the help that his soulforce provided to his body was smaller than normal. If it weren’t for him cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique, he would’ve been in an even worse state.</p>
 <p>If Huo Yuhao had had the full two hours to complete the hundred laps, he could’ve still persevered and completed them, albeit with much difficulty. However, after Zhou Yi delaying him earlier, it was just too difficult for him. Deliberately increasing his speed had substantially drained his physical strength. At this moment, he was three laps behind the students next to him, and was still twenty laps away from the hundred laps. Running twenty laps within fifteen minutes was something that was nearly impossible for him.</p>
