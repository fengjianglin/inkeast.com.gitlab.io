But she was still hurt to some degree. Even so, she still managed to maintain more than 70% of her abilities. More importantly, she was confident in her Vermilion Ice Toad’s lethal poison.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Yueheng could delay the spread of the poison with his soul emperor cultivation, but what about these two? What cultivation did they have? The tournament would likely end if they were even slightly touched by the Vermilion Ice Toad’s poison.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing that Meng Hongchen couldn’t figure out was why the two of them had such tenacious looks in their eyes. Did they still think that they had a chance in this tournament? They were Shrek’s last standing members, and they had no choice but to compete. Meng Hongchen revealed a cold look on her face. Though she was attracted to Wang Dong, this was a competition that involved the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s glory. This tournament might even concern the Sun Moon Empire’s glory. She couldn’t lose. The pride in her heart had never been inferior to her brother’s.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenfiend Douluo took in a deep breath. After that, he lifted his right hand up before it jolted downwards, “Match, start!”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he shouted, everyone opened their eyes wide. Their pupils even shrank. Everyone’s attention was drawn to the competition stage.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the city wall, the Star Luo Emperor and the White Tiger Duke didn’t really converse either. Their palms were pressed on the crenelations, and they were watching the match anxiously.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger squinted his eyes, and they glowed with light. When he saw Huo Yuhao, he had a weird feeling. He couldn’t tell what it was exactly, but Huo Yuhao naturally drew his attention. Could this young fellow create a miracle?</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both parties unleashed their martial souls as the competition began. Meng Hongchen lifted her arms, and two streaks of icy-blue light instantly appeared.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her armor was damaged. But her Class 6 swords were still intact. Her defense might have been weakened without the Impregnable Wall and armor, but her offensive ability wasn’t much affected.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen took in a deep breath behind Meng Hongchen and repressed the pain in his body. He also unleashed his Three-Legged Golden Toad. Golden, metal foam spilled out, and barrels started to appear on his body.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although these metal barrels only formed a third of the barrels that he had formed in the previous round under his Golden Coagulation and Metal Manipulation, a stable core formation still appeared. Not only that, but his aura also ballooned, and the opening of every barrel shone with strong light. They also seemed ready to be fired.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen had mastered long-range range soul tools and close-combat soul tools respectively. They divided up their roles well, and they excelled in their respective roles. Although Xiao Hongchen was critically injured, one was likely to suffer if he dared to underestimate Xiao Hongchen.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these metal barrels were formed, Xiao Hongchen also formed a thick, pitch-black barrel on his shoulder. When he lifted this barrel, his entire face turned pale. His body also trembled a little. This showed how heavy this soul tool cannon was.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao had already burst towards them as they unleashed their soul tools.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling Radiant Butterfly Goddess appeared behind Wang Dong, whereas Huo Yuhao’s body was blocked, and he couldn’t be seen.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong had unleashed his martial soul in the previous rounds, but no one had noticed a three-ringed soul master like him. But now he was the center of attention.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His blue wings flapped open, and golden light patterns surfaced. An intense aura of light spread, along with his charming looks, and Meng Hongchen was suddenly left in a daze.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen had a sudden feeling that only such a dazzling martial soul was worthy of him!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s figure started to rise as his wings flapped open. As they started to flap, he leapt in Meng Hongchen and Xiao Hongchen’s direction.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was tightly stuck to Wang Dong’s back, and his hands were around his waist. The two of them seemed like the same person now.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Meng Hongchen and Xiao Hongchen couldn’t see Huo Yuhao’s arms around Wang Dong’s waist, as Huo Yuhao’s Imitation started to take effect.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s speed was naturally inferior to Ma Xiaotao’s, but he was not slow. As he flapped his wings, he emitted a dazzling and blinding golden-blue radiance which enabled him to quicken his speed through the air. Huo Yuhao had also unleashed his soul tool thruster behind him. Although it was only a Class 2 thruster, it still allowed Wang Dong’s speed to increase by at least 30%.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen’s attack began. Streaks of light shot out, and they started to engulf Wang Dong’s body.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since he was a soul engineer, using a long-range soul tool to lock onto his target was very basic. Even though he was critically injured, he was confident that he could strike his opponent.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul tool rays and soul tool cannon shells engulfed Wang Dong as if they were windstorms. There were even soul tools among them that could lock onto their opponents.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the two of them fell into a slight trance just as they were about to attack.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen’s attack had already been unleashed, but its lock-on effect didn’t work.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was going on? Xiao Hongchen was shocked. But he had unleashed several of his long-range soul tools at the same time. His all-round attack had already been launched.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen believed that it would be very difficult for Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong to resist his wave of attacks with their abilities. He used Class 5 soul tools that even soul kings had to be careful of. Moreover, his attack was so condensed. Even if they used the Golden Road, what kind of effect could it produce? That martial fusion soul skill of theirs was a control-type skill, meaning that it was unlikely to strike both Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen. Even if they were struck, nothing would happen. There was no way that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong could get close to them.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen had the same thoughts. But their eyes soon opened wide. That was because they discovered that they were wrong.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against the attacks of Class 5 soul tools, one could dodge instead of resisting them!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s wings retracted before he made a breathtaking escape.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His pair of wings seemed to have a life of their own. They flapped open before retracting, flapping and drifting. Every transformation adjusted his flying posture slightly.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streaks of soul tool rays and soul tool cannon shells slid past him because they couldn’t lock onto him.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was like a Radiant Butterfly Goddess that was facing a huge web. No matter how all-engulfing that web was, he could find a loophole to escape.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His glittery dodges even left streaks of dazzling shadows in mid-air. Bright, golden-blue flowing light caused the spectators to erupt in cheers.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone sympathized with the underdogs. The spectators’ emotions reached their height as they witnessed Wang Dong’s impeccable dodges. They were even praying for Shrek Academy. It didn’t matter whether they had wagered on the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, “The insider knows the ropes, while the outsider just comes along for the ride.” The spectators were extremely excited as they watched the competition, but the true soul masters were also wide-eyed right now!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Including the Star Luo Emperor and White Tiger Duke, those who were observing carefully or soul masters with great visual powers could tell that Huo Yuhao’s soul tool thruster had developed slight changes as Wang Dong was dodging Xiao Hongchen’s attack. This meant that his soul tool thruster had launched, but not with great intensity. But it was these gentle propulsions that enabled Wang Dong to dodge successfully time and time again. The cooperation between the two of them couldn’t just be described using great chemistry; they were almost like the same person!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they would vomit out blood if they knew what Huo Yuhao was thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his spiritual power became stronger, his Spiritual Interference started to reveal its strength. What enabled Wang Dong’s agile dodging of Xiao Hongchen’s attacks was naturally the Spiritual Detection Sharing. With both the Spiritual Interference and Spiritual Detection Sharing, it was not difficult for the two of them to cooperate with each other.</span></p>

He was whining about Wang Dong’s thin waist. Both his hands were already touching when he hugged Wang Dong’s waist. He didn’t feel as if he was hugging Wang Dong tightly enough.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Wang Dong’s butt was extremely perky and pressed against Huo Yuhao’s belly. It was a little weird and uncomfortable.</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of dodges enabled Wang Dong to slip through the web of soul tool rays and soul tool cannon shells. If Xiao Hongchen were in his peak state, his attacks would be at least 3 times more condensed practically flawless. No matter how powerful Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was, he wouldn’t have been able to help Wang Dong escape then. But they succeeded now.</span></p>

She swung her pair of thin swords, and two streaks of light were launched towards Wang Dong’s path.</span></p>
