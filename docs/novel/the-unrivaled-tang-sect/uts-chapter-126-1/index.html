 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this moment that the audience finally took notice of them. There was no need to even mention how much of a miserable state the two siblings were in. Disregarding Xiao Hongchen, even Meng Honchen’s mouth and nose were covered in bloodstains. They seemed to have come to their senses at this moment, but they couldn’t do anything other than reveal the shock in their eyes.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen suddenly let out a muffled groan, and he directly fell to the floor. However, his eyes were actually filled with infatuation the moment before he collapsed.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Meng Hongchen’s eyes were only filled with shock. She couldn’t believe that the city-overthrowing beauty that made even her look inferior was created by a fusion skill.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peerless beauty descended from the sky and swiftly landed in front of the duo, a chilly intent radiating from her golden eyes as she did so.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Meng Hongchen was finally able to clearly see the characters on the peerless beauty’s forehead. This character was clearly a trident, and it was very small, seemingly only an inch wide. Moreover, it quietly faded as the peerless beauty landed. However, it left behind a noble sense of awe on her forehead, though it had only existed for a brief moment.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye.” The young lady’s red lips rose gently. With a gentle sweep of her wings, a three-colored halo of light immediately covered Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen’s bodies. However, it didn’t seem to hurt them; it only sent their bodies off the tournament stage.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen didn’t try to resist it. Due to Xiao Hongchen’s heavy injuries, Hongchen’s Yearning had been unleashed using her own soul power only. Furthermore, after it was forcefully interrupted by Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s Spiritual Storm, they were struck with a heavy backlash. At this moment, they truly didn’t possess any fighting strength at all.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tri-colored butterfly wings vanished, and the peerless beauty moved towards the very center of the tournament stage with a flash. A layer of frost formed wherever she passed.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan observed everything from below the tournament stage with a flabbergasted look in his eyes. He murmured, “We, we won? Elder Xuan, we won! We’re the champions, we’re truly the champions!” His voice was trembling. When he uttered his last sentence, he was already shouting in a hysterical manner.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was no calmer than Wang Yan. Every single wrinkle on his aged face seemed to be filled with vitality as he said, “They, just how did they do it? Was what they just used a fusion skill?”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, right!” Wang Yan said excitedly, “I was the only person who they told about that last fusion skill. If I’m not mistaken, Huo Yuhao said that that fusion skill was produced when his Ice Jade Scorpion fused with Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess. It is called the Solitary Dance Amidst Frost, Raiment of Light. I didn’t think that a fusion skill would be this, this beautiful! This is also the only fusion skill they possess which is controlled by Wang Dong.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve won.” The peerless beauty landed right in front of the Heavenfiend Douluo.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this great referee still had a dazed look in his eyes as he looked at this young lady, whose age seemed to be in the double digits. His voice was clearly somewhat hoarse as he said, “Yes, you… you’ve won.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After speaking, Huang Heyun seemed to slip slightly. He was only able to regain his footing after stabilising himself.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Storm wasn’t just a pure spiritual-type attack, but an attack that could directly go through an opponent’s spiritual sea to unceasingly attack their spirit by using various memories. It didn’t do something as simple as destroying a target’s spirit, but affected their consciousness.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huang Heyun was a Titled Douluo, he had endured far, far too many things in his life. He had watched his close relatives and friends die one by one, and he had buried that pain deep in his heart. As he didn’t make any preparations to block Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s Spiritual Storm, Huang Heyun was affected much more than Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tri-colored light vanished, and the peerless beauty once again turned into a bright, colorful halo. The halo of light quietly dissipated, revealing the two figures who were hugging each other.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were extremely pale, and they were both supporting and nestling up against each other as they quietly stood there.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tattoo of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion on Huo Yuhao’s back slowly faded away. However, Wang Dong had already fallen into a deep sleep against his chest. Only the golden trident on his forehead flickered quietly for a bit.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t able to see all this. Although he was barely able to stand up while supporting Wang Dong, overexhausting his body had caused him to gradually lose all six of his senses. He only felt a patch of darkness surround him, but he didn’t feel any regret; at this moment, he only felt excitement and happiness. His last memory was that of him tightly hugging Wang Dong while standing on the tournament stage of the finals of the Continental Advanced Academy Soul Duelling Tournament with his back straight.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this exact moment, he felt as though his spiritual sea had been upgraded to a higher level amidst this happiness. Right after that, he didn’t know what happened.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, an uproarious cheer completely covered the entire tournament stage. Every single member of the audience had reddened faces due to their excitement.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the waiting and hardships they had to endure were all worth it, in their opinion. The finals of this tournament could no longer be simply described using the word ‘marvelous’. On the contrary, it was a classic that would be eternally engraved within their hearts!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was especially so for the curtain call, with Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong releasing their fourth fusion skill. The city-overthrowing peerless beauty formed by their Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost, Raiment of Light had been deeply engraved in all of their hearts.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was too beautiful, simply too beautiful. That was a type of beauty that simply didn’t belong to the world of mortals.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps that was simply the descent of the Goddess of Light.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single person had a different definition of what a goddess was in their minds, but at this moment, that had all been replaced by the young lady who had been dancing alone amidst the frost. The figure of that peerless beauty had even been elevated to the level of worship in many of their hearts.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That figure possessed a combination of beauty and strength, and was the most dazzling figure within the fight. Everything that had just occurred was simply too astonishing.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenfiend Douluo Huang Jinxu forcefully took a deep breath, then forcefully shoved the scenes which were unceasingly flickering through his mind to the depths of his spiritual sea. He said loudly, “The 2-2-3 match has ended, and the winner is Shrek Academy. This year’s Continental Advanced Academy Soul Duelling Tournament has come to an end. The final winner is the representative team from Shrek Academy!”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sounds of cheering were brought to a peak following his announcement. The entirety of the Star Luo Plaza was now boiling, and even many of the aristocrats and ministers who stood on the city walls couldn’t help but yell out.</span></p>
