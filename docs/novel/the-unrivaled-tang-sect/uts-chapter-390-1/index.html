You’ve never been able to keep secrets. Telling you is equivalent to telling the entire continent. Forget it. When Huo Yuhao wakes up, I’ll follow all of you to the Tang Sect if he’s fine. This is a top secret of our sect, and we can only share it with the sect leader of the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu twisted her lips, and seemed very displeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a strong wave of soul power caught their attention, and they both turned towards Huo Yuhao at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light from the seven-colored barrier slowly weakened, and the huge vertical eye behind Huo Yuhao that had disappeared re-surfaced again. The sunray patterns around the Eye of Destiny on his forehead became weaker, and his Eye of Destiny, which was shining with intersecting black and white lights, suddenly revealed a gentle charm</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gentle rose-gold color subtly appeared in this vertical eye. The black and white lights intersected before retracting, turning into a pupil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they only took one glance at it, Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu felt like their spirits had been pulled out of their bodies. Nan Shuishui’s reaction was extremely fast. She quickly lifted her hands and covered her and her daughter’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weakening seven-colored barrier suddenly became stronger just as it looked like it was going to disappear. Following this, it turned into a seven-colored beam that shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a pleasant voice echoed in the air. The visible sky had turned completely golden at this moment.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao’s body seemed as if it were made of pure gold, and his Eye of Destiny turned back to black and white. It was as if death and life took turns flashing in his eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The transformations in the sky didn’t last too long. Suddenly, the golden sky seemed to turn into clouds, which rapidly spun around. The golden light retracted, and changed into a huge golden funnel. It started to gather towards Huo Yuhao’s head, which formed the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light disappeared, and Huo Yuhao’s vertical eye returned to its rose-gold color, while heaven and earth turned black and white.</span></p>

Even Nan Shuishui, who was a Soul Douluo and wielded the Annihilation element, felt like she was being strangled, and couldn’t breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this short process, she became even more determined to work closely with the Tang Sect. She saw the Tang Sect’s unlimited potential in the future through the strange occurrences that kept happening to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

A black slit was torn open in the air, and the golden light quickly entered this slit. As the slit closed up, the golden light disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu only roughly saw that the golden light was in a shape of a small beast.</span></p>

She was beautiful and quiet. Her white dress accentuated her powdery-blue straight hair, making it seemed even more dazzling and eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her fingers were crossed, both her hands on her chest. No matter what angle one looked at her from, she seemed perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that she was too quiet. If not for the slight rise and fall of her chest, she would seem like the perfect sculpture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, everything in the room started to distort slightly. It felt as if a scorching flame had just swept past, and the air started to ripple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black slit appeared as ripples formed in the air. Following this, a streak of golden light drifted down and gradually landed on this young lady’s chest, before slowly fusing with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, there was an additional golden halo around her. Her powder-blue long hair started to light up with a glow of the same color, resonating with the streak of golden light on her chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That streak of golden light slowly took form and turned into a long, golden staff, or rather a long, golden handle, drifting in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An image of a golden trident also surfaced on her forehead.</span></p>

This streak of golden light turned into the head of a trident and slowly linked up with the golden handle in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the handle and the head of the trident connected, the entire room turned golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amid the intense golden light, a blue butterfly subtly opened up its wings. A golden dragon slowly revolved around it…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young lady was still sleeping very soundly. The outside world didn’t seem to affect her at all. However, her straight hair started to slowly curl, and formed wavy shapes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

Huo Yuhao’s strange, yet terrifying vertical eye also slowly shut, and his forehead was smooth again.</span></p>

Two streams of tears flowed down from his bright eyes. Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu were astonished that his tears glowed a faint gold. They shone brightly under the illumination of the sunlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A spiritual intent filled with sorrow started to spread from him. Nan Qiuqiu’s tears also started to flow uncontrollably after a momentary daze as she was affected by this spiritual intent of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui’s expression changed in astonishment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intent that he reveals unwittingly can even influence people around him. Qiuqiu is almost at the level of a Soul Emperor. However, she can’t even resist it. His spiritual power must be very great!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui was certain that Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was greater than hers. Even if he had just obtained his sixth soul ring, he should still only be a Soul Emperor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was able to leave her so terrified, even though she was a Soul Douluo! This was something unheard of in the world of soul masters.</span></p>

He just drifted gently to the ground. When he looked over, the tears in his eyes suddenly changed into countless ice flowers that scattered away. An icy light flashed across his eyes before it disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Holy! Ghost! Church!” He seemed to shout these three words from between his teeth. His earlier aloofness instantly turned into a terrifying chill. Even Nan Shuishui turned pale from the suppression that he produced, and took a step back.&nbsp;</span></p>

She could confirm now that Huo Yuhao’s abilities couldn’t be judged through his soul power. His terrifying spiritual power had already enhanced him to a higher level, and it wasn’t just one level. As for how strong he was, that could only be determined by facing him directly.</span></p>

However, his eyes were still filled with torment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qiu’er, Qiu’er…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped crying. When sorrow reached a certain level, tears were unable to flow anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief moment, the chill that he released from his body gradually faded away. However, his face turned stiff, and he no longer had any expression on his face. He turned back calmly and looked at Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu. “Thank you for protecting me. I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui had already lifted her daughter up at this moment. She opened her mouth and wanted to claim that Huo Yuhao was definitely not fine! However, she didn’t say it. No, she didn’t dare to do so. The icy-cold look in Huo Yuhao’s eyes and his indifferent expression caused her to shudder. She was more willing to see a bawling Huo Yuhao than she was to see him in this state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing sadder than a withered heart. Wang Dong’er was asleep, and Wang Qiu’er had sacrificed herself for him. After being dealt two heavy blows, Huo Yuhao was already strong &nbsp;if he had not gone. However, he was already at his limit. If he was dealt any further blows, would he collapse?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui was a sect leader. Although she sighed in her heart, she wasn’t as weak as her daughter. She walked in front of Huo Yuhao and didn’t discuss anything related to Wang Qiu’er. She only asked, “Yuhao, where are we going next?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao seemed to have a plan in mind, and said, “Sect leader Nan, you can return with Qiuqiu first. I need to go to a place first before I return to the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui said, “No words can express my gratitude. I also have a few things to discuss with your sect leader. You can get busy with your stuff first. I’ll send Qiuqiu back to the Tang Sect, and let’s meet at the Tang Sect later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded. “Alright. I’ll need to trouble you to tell my eldest senior that I’m fine, and that I’ll return soon. After this, tell him that Qiu’er was the Auspicious Beast in the Great Star Dou Forest, and she sacrificed herself for me. I’m afraid that the soul beasts in the forest will take revenge. The Academy must take precautions. After I complete one more task, I’ll return.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui wore a gentle look as she looked at him and said gently, “Kid, don’t be too hard on yourself. You must always look forward. Let’s go to the Tang Sect immediately. Take the words that you said back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in a daze as he looked at Nan Shuishui’s gentle gaze. He suddenly felt that he had seen his mother’s face. Instantly, he was about to tear up, and struggled to stop himself from calling out for his mother. He nodded gently and pointed his toes to the ground before turning around and leaping away. He used his Butterfly Wings as he flew into the distance rapidly.</span></p>

His current condition…”</span></p>
