 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

She leapt gently forward with her left leg, and her slender figure was suddenly halfway in the air. Her tri-colored butterfly wings brought her skywards effortlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thick icy fog spread from her legs and turned into streaks surrounding her as she rose.</span></p>

Her moving looks were covered by the glow of life and hope, and her six wings were the best accessories she could possibly have. The Raiment of Light was revealed as she was covered by the warm sunshine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ravishing figure started to perform a solitary dance amid the icy fog. Her tri-colored wings extended and retracted, making her elegance even more dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A subtle golden talisman silently appeared on her forehead. As light flashed from the talisman, it revealed a gentle glow. Intense spiritual undulations caused her to enter a miraculous state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost, Raiment of Light!</span></p>

Everyone’s gaze was focused on her. They couldn’t believe that a person could be so beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the dazzling, tri-colored wings opened up, the Goddess of Light took a step forward and seemed to shrink space about her. She advanced several dozen meters and appeared in front of the opponents that had survived the explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two remaining dark golden bats gathered together. A light flashed, and they formed a larger bat. However, this bat had two heads! In fact, it was more accurate to say that it had three heads! It was just that one was only left with the stump of a neck, there wasn’t any head left. Evidently, it must have had been struck off by the Snowless Glacier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone from the Tang Sect finally realized what Cain’s martial soul was. It was an extremely rare but top-ranked martial soul, the Darkgolden Three-headed Batking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t only strong; it was a terrifying martial soul that only appeared after a mutation occurred. In the world of soul masters, it was a powerful martial soul that had previously only existed in legends!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Cain was definitely in her Martial Soul True Body. Her trump card was similar to Xue Bing. They both used soul tools to forcefully enhance themselves to reach their Martial Soul True Body state. However, they were both spent right now, and it was very difficult for them to maintain their Martial Soul True Bodies anymore. After all, their Martial Soul True Bodies had been forced to manifest. Compared to real Martial Soul True Bodies, they could at most unleash sixty percent of their maximum abilities in such a state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, sixty percent of Cain’s maximum abilities was enough to save her life. Otherwise, the combination of the Snowless Glacier and Executioner’s Blade would’ve killed her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Goddess of Light opened her wings, an extremely chilly aura was released. Wang Dong’er and Huo Yuhao didn’t just possess two and three rings like they had the last time they unleashed the Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost in a tournament. They were very strong now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any warning, a snowstorm was unleashed, with the Goddess of Light at the center of it. Three people were immediately engulfed by this snowstorm, and those on the outside couldn’t see what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess of Light was Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s last martial soul fusion skill because it wasn’t an attack that could only be used one time. They could attack continuously and unleash their complete fighting strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t able to maintain such strength or use so much power in the past. However, the Goddess of Light was able to unleash all of their abilities now. It wasn’t their Martial Soul True Body; it was stronger than a Martial Soul True Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The referee, Zheng Zhan, cursed and immediately rushed in the direction of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. As he couldn’t see what was going on, he couldn’t tell what they were up to. It was a dazzling martial soul fusion skill! He didn’t expect them to have such a trick up their sleeves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cain and Xue Bing felt as if they had entered an extremely chilly world. They even felt their blood solidifying in the cold. As their bloodflow slowed, they felt the circulation of their soul power also dropping significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Bing had been thrown onto the floor several times by Jiang Nannan earlier, and could feel his body breaking apart. His soul power was almost depleted after two consecutive fights. Against the extreme cold, he could only forcefully circulate his soul power to resist the snowflakes that resembled sharp knives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cain was in a better state. However, one of her bat heads had been destroyed. This hurt her martial soul, and she couldn’t recover from this in a day or two like normal. It was just like Xiao Xiao when her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron had been crushed; she might even not recover completely at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cain let out a piercing scream. It was her Terrorscream again. She didn’t expect her skill to hurt the Goddess of Light, she was only trying to find her opponent. She didn’t want to rush out blindly. In this snowblind world, she couldn’t possibly get her directions right. She didn’t know where her enemy was, and she still had to protect Xue Bing. Thus, she didn’t dare to act recklessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t waste your energy. Don’t worry, I won’t kill the two of you,” a moving voice sounded. The frost seemed to split, revealing a ravishing figure slowly walking toward them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they were in harsh conditions, Xue Bing’s eyes widened in shock when he saw the Goddess of Light. He couldn’t believe that there was someone so perfect in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Three-headed Batking’s wings opened wide, and Cain burst towards the Goddess of Light like a bolt of lightning. She knew that their surroundings would return to normal as long as she could defeat the Goddess of Light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a pity that she was engulfed by a beam of golden and blue light less than five meters after she moved. It was a Hexagram Array that now also carried the Ultimate Ice. Within this Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, the aura that it released was entirely concealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Three-headed Batking struggled indignantly. Xue Bing also tried to stand up and resist further. However, they were in very weak states right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, three huge cauldrons blocked the Unbreakable Douluo Zheng Zhan as he rushed out. One of the cauldrons was stacked on top of the other two cauldrons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Referee, you can’t interfere since victory hasn’t been decided yet,” Xiao Xiao spoke out. Right now, they had already gathered on the other side to aid Xu Sanshi in his formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get lost!” Zheng Zhan shouted in fury. He clapped his hands, and a wave of dominant soul power swept the cauldrons to one side. However, the terrifying red in the sky appeared once again as he tried to burst towards the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng Zhan turned pale, and he was about to curse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was a Titled Douluo, he couldn’t separate his body like the Darkgolden Three-headed Batking! On the one hand, he couldn’t tell what the situation was like inside the snowstorm. On the other, he was afraid of someone else dying if they were struck by the terrifying ray. He was left with no choice. His figure flashed, and he blocked the attack on Qing Qing, also announcing that she had been eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Jun was kicked out a few seconds after Qing Qing. Even though his shield had many special skills, he didn’t stand a chance with his inferior cultivation. Xu Sanshi’s Turtle God’s Strike helped him destroy his opponent’s shield directly. If not for Zheng Zhan’s intervention, Chen Jun’s body would also have been crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As this slight delay happened, the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice on the other side also spread out and began to vanish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess of Light danced. Her wings opened and turned into a streak of flowing light that moved straight towards the Golden Tree wheelchair. At this point, there were two ice sculptures left within the area covered by the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>

She was actually an attractive young lady with a weirdly pale complexion.</span></p>

There was huge wounds on his chest and belly. However, these injuries couldn’t be seen clearly, as he was frozen.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao was quietly sitting in his wheelchair, while Wang Dong’er was standing in front of him. The two of them looked at each other and smiled.</span></p>

After a few attempts, he realized he couldn’t melt them free. The two ice sculptures were very hard, and their temperatures were extremely low. He didn’t dare to forcefully break the ice. If he did so, the two of them would die very quickly.</span></p>

Referee, my soul power isn’t sufficient, so I can’t melt them. Don’t worry, their lives won’t be in danger, as the temperature of Ultimate Ice is very low. When my soul power recovers, I can help to melt them. Their pulse just has to be restarted before they can regain their life power. In this state, they won’t die even after a year.”</span></p>

He knew that there were some things that a referee like him couldn’t do. If they didn’t want to melt the two of them, what could he do? It was the Ultimate Ice. No one on the continent would dare to melt these ice sculptures!</span></p>
