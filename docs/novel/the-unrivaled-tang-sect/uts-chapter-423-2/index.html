When he saw the White Tiger bodyguards and the soul engineers of the Star Luo Empire’s First Soul Master Legion being killed, he felt something wasn’t right. The vertical eye had appeared at a very weird time.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was sent by His Majesty, why didn’t he show himself immediately? Furthermore, why didn’t he discuss it with us before he appeared?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he thought of all this, Ye Yulin was suddenly shocked. He shouted, “Stop!” His voice was transmitted through a sound amplifying soul tool. The soul engineers from the Terrorclaw Soul Engineering Legion and Evil Tyrant Soul Engineering Legion could hear him clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul engineer legions were very disciplined. They needed to coordinate extremely well within their ranks in order to unleash their greatest fighting strength. All the soul engineers stopped instantly, and the entire place went silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things didn’t seem amiss below. Tragic screams and sorrowful cries could be heard. The remaining White Tiger bodyguards quickly gathered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke had already disappeared under the attack of Ye Yulin’s Sunmoon Divine Needle and there was only a huge crater in the ground where he had been standing. Everything seemed to be very normal. However, Ye Yulin felt that something wasn’t right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Remove the barrier,” Ye Yulin ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two soul engineer legions trusted him. After all, it seemed like everything had been decided. It wasn’t possible for those on the ground to attack them or fly into the sky. The two huge protective soul barriers were quickly retracted and turned into streaks of lights that fused with the soul tool behind every soul engineer’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these protective soul barriers were retracted, Ye Yulin’s expression suddenly changed, and he shouted furiously, “No! It’s an illusion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, he could immediately sense intense spiritual undulations the moment the barriers were retracted. If not for the fact that he was wary, he might not have noticed these spiritual undulations at all. However, these spiritual undulations weren’t aimed at the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were clearly engulfing the airborne legions. If that person earlier was helping them, why would his spiritual undulations be engulfing them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While a joint protective soul barrier was very strong, there was still one problem: it completely isolated the outside world. As a result, they weren’t able to sense the strong spiritual undulations earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he discovered that something was wrong, Ye Yulin couldn’t be bothered with conserving his soul power anymore. His Sunmoon Divine Needle immediately turned and faced the rose-gold vertical eye before firing an intense beam of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This beam of golden-silver light immediately turned illusory and disappeared when it got close to that rose-gold vertical eye. Instantly, everything within the view of all the soul engineers completely changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no longer a bloody scene below. Yes, there were many holes that were blown apart in the ground. However, there wasn’t even a single corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The First Soul Master Legion had already vanished. After such a long time, they had already flown more than five kilometers with their flying-type soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Bodyguards had also disappeared from their line of sight. The White Tiger Duke was nowhere to be seen. What left Ye Yulin even more depressed was that he didn’t know who had released the rose-gold vertical eye. Given how strong that illusory soul skill was, it had to be at least the work of a Titled Douluo who possessed great spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chase them! The White Tiger Duke won’t forsake his bodyguards. He must be over there.” As he spoke, Ye Yulin quickly activated his flying-type soul tool and chased after the White Tiger bodyguards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Ye Yulin and the others were attacking with all their strength, Dai Hao discovered that something was wrong. He could hear tremendous booms behind him. As he turned, he saw the countless soul rays that were raining down on them, but these soul rays were still striking the original spot they were in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t chase after them. The rose-gold vertical eye was still flashing brightly in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His doubt instantly turned into extreme delight. He understood that someone must have used some method to misdirect the two soul engineer legions, and made them think that they were still in their original spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he heard that voice earlier, he could tell that it was a familiar one. It sounded like the guy who gave him the Sunmoon Divine Needle before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he realized all this, Dai Hao didn’t bother running far away anymore. If he wanted to escape, he had a lot of opportunities to do so right now. No matter how strong Ye Yulin was or how magical his Sunmoon Divine Needle was, it wasn’t a problem for him to escape the detection range of Ye Yulin’s Sunmoon Divine Needle given his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he still turned back without any hesitation. This was because he had to leave with his brothers even if he wanted to escape. They would either survive together or die together!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao returned to his White Tiger bodyguards and shouted at the top of his voice, “White Tigers, run with all your might! Don’t care about what’s happening behind! This is our only chance!” He just hoped that the powerful individual would be able to delay Ye Yulin a bit longer. While he knew that it would be very difficult to escape with so many White Tiger bodyguards, he had no choice right now. At this moment, he saw a beam of light penetrating the rose-gold vertical eye in the distance, and the aerial attacks on the ground had already ceased. After this, he heard Ye Yulin roaring furiously before the two soul engineering legions attacked again. They flew extremely quickly towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Are we still unable to escape in the end?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao revealed a lost look in his eyes. However, this was already the best result they could achieve. At least those from the First Soul Master Legion had left. There was still a glimmer of hope for the empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao wasn’t cowardly, and there was a determined look in his eyes. Just as he was about to fly up to fight his enemies, that mysterious voice sounded again. In addition, his voice now reached every White Tiger bodyguard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“White Tigers, continue to run forward and enter the black doors in front of you. When you enter, don’t act recklessly no matter what you see. This is your only chance to survive. Quick! Or else it’ll be too late.” At the end, that voice sounded very anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao was stunned and quickly turned around. He was shocked to discover that several pitch-black doors had risen behind him. There were twelve of these doors. Every door was around three meters wide and ten meters tall. They gave off a very mysterious feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The magnificent demonic patterns around these doors revealed a sinister aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Dai Hao’s decisiveness was revealed. He didn’t hesitate and immediately gave an order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Enter those black doors in order. There must be no confusion.” The best way to enter those doors wasn’t just by running towards them. The White Tiger bodyguards had to adopt a strict and neat formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger bodyguards were already prepared to die. However, how could they not be delightfully surprised now that they were offered a glimmer of hope? If they could live, who would be willing to die?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the fit White Tiger bodyguards sprinted towards those twelve black doors. However, they tried their best to maintain their formation as they charged, and weren’t messy as they made their escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao didn’t leave. He rose into the sky. He had already calculated very clearly that during this short period of time they were offered, his White Tiger bodyguards would be within the attacking range of the two soul engineering legions before they entered the black doors. He was not going to leave until the last White Tiger bodyguard was safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could the White Tiger Duke be ordinary, given that his subordinates were willing to risk their lives for him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He heard a sigh and subconsciously turned his head to one side. He only saw a black figure floating not far away from him.</span></p>

His laughter sounded very free and easy, “Of course I know how foolish it is. However, this is what White Tigers believe in. Even if I’m foolish, I have to stay true to this belief. I have descendants, so what if I die? Thank you, Sir. You must be the one helping us. You must be the same guy from before, am I right?”</span></p>

However, he also sounded very relieved when he finished speaking.</span></p>
