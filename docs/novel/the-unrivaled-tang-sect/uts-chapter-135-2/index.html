<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen was the one who was shocked now. He was already shocked when he had been discovered. With the concealment-type soul tool that he had created himself, he believed that he was undiscoverable as long as he didn’t move. But Elder Xuan managed to trace him. He was even more surprised that Elder Xuan invited him into the Sea God’s Pavilion.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen hesitated. The Sea God’s Pavilion was probably a place that was easy to enter, but not easy to leave! After all, this was Shrek Academy. Although he had sufficient cards in his hands, Shrek Academy had been established for many years, and was ever-present on the Douluo Continent. It was also because of Shrek that the Sun Moon Empire had many misgivings and proceeded cautiously. They didn’t dare to act recklessly even though they had sufficient resources.</p> 
 <p>Sea God’s Pavilion. What a Sea God’s Pavilion!</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan walked in front of the Sea God’s Pavilion before turning around and joking, “What? As the Hallmaster of the Illustrious Virtue Hall, you don’t dare to enter the Sea God’s Pavilion? Why are you here since that is the case?”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen pricked his brows. His haughtiness was even greater than Du Busi’s. He had only appeared now because he didn’t want to mix with the Body Sect and affect his reputation. After being provoked by Elder Xuan, he laughed loudly before walking into the Sea God’s Pavilion with big steps.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu revealed a slight smile on his face and was in awe of Elder Xuan in his heart. Elder Xuan was indeed an expert in human psychology! The simple action of inviting Jing Hongchen into the Sea God’s Pavilion greatly diminished his mighty aura.</p> 
 <p>After entering the Sea God’s Pavilion first level, Jing Hongchen’s gaze moved around the entire level. He was slightly stunned. It was obvious that he could tell that the Sea God’s Pavilion was extraordinary.</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan walked to the golden tree seats at one side of the first level before sitting down. He also gestured for Jing Hongchen to take a seat.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen didn’t stand on ceremony either. He smiled at Elder Xuan before sitting opposite him.</p> 
 <p>Neither of them spoke first, and they only stared at each other as they sat there. But the air around them was about to solidify because of their auras.</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan and Jing Hongchen had similar auras – they were very pressing. But the difference was that Elder Xuan’s aura appeared foundationally stable like the earth, whereas Jing Hongchen’s aura originated from a suppression that might be unleashed at anytime.</p> 
 <p>“It seems like soul tools can help a soul master to a certain standard. Your cultivation is only around Rank 93, but you can stabilize yourself in front of me.” Elder Xuan said slowly.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen smiled and replied, “I believe that soul tool research is only in its preliminary stage. The world belongs to soul tools in the future. When the day comes when soul tools no longer rely on soul masters’ soul power as a motivation, soul masters will be eliminated. I wonder if Elder Xuan is convinced by this belief.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan replied coldly, “It doesn’t matter whether I believe it or not. Anyway, you won’t live to see that day.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s not important whether I’ll live to see that day,” Jing Hongchen said very casually, “it’s enough if it happens in the Sun Moon Empire, and it will happen in the Sun Moon Empire. Star Luo, Heavenly Soul, Dou Ling and even your Shrek Academy are too far off in the aspect of soul tools.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan laughed, “Oh? Are we that far off? I don’t think so. Since when were you able to exploit this gap to defeat Shrek Academy? We only sent half of our main forces for the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament that just ended. But we still won. This proves that your advantage in soul tools is not decisive yet.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan was surprised that Jing Hongchen nodded after hearing his words, “You’re right. I received news from your academy that expressed your interest to hold an exchange with the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. I was very happy then. But for some reason, your academy changed its mind. If it’s because of the tournament, I don’t think it’s necessary. The Sun Moon Empire is magnanimous. A tournament is a tournament. We won’t develop a hatred because of accidents during the tournament.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan asked, “Is this your reason for coming today?”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen answered, “Partly. There’s another reason too. I want to get the Judgement Sword back. It’s one of my best creations, and holds great significance for me too. I hope that you can return it to me.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan nodded his head seriously and said, “I can return it. I will return it to you as long as you can allow Ma Xiaotao to fully heal.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen turned dismal and replied, “Elder Xuan, you can’t put it this way. Many of our elite students have also died under your students’ hands. But we never asked for any compensation.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan said indifferently, “Can your students compare to Xiaotao? Ma Xiaotao will succeed the role of Dean of the Martial Soul Department of our academy. She’s not even 20 years old, but she’s already a seven-ringed Soul Sage. Furthermore, she has a top-ranked martial soul. No one in the continent can match up to her in a one-on-one fight. Shrek Academy won’t seize your things forcefully, but Xiaotao’s condition is special. Her martial soul has transformed negatively, and she’s been in a coma till now. After we find a treatment for her using that sword, we’ll return it to you.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen furrowed his brows and asked, “Is there no room for negotiation?”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan didn’t speak and only looked at him calmly.</p> 
 <p>After pondering for a moment, Jing Hongchen said, “What if I exchange something of equal value for it?”</p> 
 <p>“I’ve told you that we’re keeping the sword to research Xiaotao’s transformed martial soul,” Elder Xuan replied coldly. </p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen stiffened a little, then said in a deep voice, “Can I take a look at her?”</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan was the one who hesitated now.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu’s voice rang out at this point, “Yes, you can. Bring him to the second level.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen’s expression became terrified as he heard this voice. He quickly stood up.</p> 
 <p>Although he hadn’t appeared with the Body Sect earlier, he had clearly witnessed the fight between Elder Xuan and Du Busi, as well as how Du Busi was deterred by Shrek Academy’s golden light.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen was very sharp even though he had not reached the level of a Transcendent Douluo. He immediately recognized that the external world’s understanding of Shrek Academy was erroneous. The strongest in Shrek Academy wasn’t the Taotie Douluo Elder Xuan, but someone else. Even Du Busi had to retreat in front of this guy. How powerful was he? That’s why he sneaked into Shrek Academy after the Body Sect left, and didn’t appear as uprightly as the Body Sect.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen said in a deep voice, “Elder Xuan and unknown elder, I have at least 3 automatic Class 9 soul tools with me now. If I’m attacked, these soul tools are powerful enough to destroy the all of Shrek City. They can’t be stopped either.”</p> 
 <p>He was around Yan Shaozhe’s age. It was normal for him to call Elder Xuan and Elder Mu his elders. It was an obvious showing of his weakness to boast about </p> 
 <p>This was Shrek Academy. There were more than 5 Transcendent Douluo from what Jing Hongchen knew. Regardless of how strong his soul tools were, he was only Rank 93. He wasn’t a match for so many Transcendent Douluo at such close distance. But he came prepared. He also believed that Shrek Academy wouldn’t really attack him. It wouldn’t fit their standards.</p> 
 <p>“You’re our guest now that you’ve entered the Sea God’s Pavilion,” Elder Mu said indifferently, “if I really wanted to touch you, your soul tools may not be able to unleash their full might.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen didn’t retort, but revealed a sense of relief. He laughed and said, “It’s my honor to be a guest of the Sea God’s Pavilion.”</p> 
 <p>He came to the second level quickly under Elder Xuan’s guidance.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu laid in his reclining chair, while Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao stood behind him.</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao was very anxious. Before he underwent his retreat, he had once asked Elder Mu about Ma Xiaotao’s condition. Elder Mu had told him then that Ma Xiaotao was fine, which gave him peace of mind as he retreated into cultivation. But it seemed like she was in grave condition from what Elder Xuan and Elder Mu said! How could he not be anxious?</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen was drawn to Elder Mu. Elder Mu might look like a frail elder and didn’t unleash any of his powerful aura, but Jing Hongchen was certain that he was the one who had previously forced the Body Sect away! Elder Mu’s abilities and cultivation couldn’t be seen just by using one’s eyes. It was unexpected that Shrek Academy had such a powerful figure. He felt surer and surer that he was right to have been cautious.</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, may I know elder’s name?” Jing Hongchen bowed slightly to Elder Mu.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu smiled and said, “My name is Mu En. I believe there’s not many in this world who still remember my name.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen was entirely lost as he heard Elder Mu’s name. He couldn’t recall such a name from his memory or investigations into Shrek Academy. He was warier of Elder Mu because of this.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu said to Elder Xuan, “Little Xuan, bring him to take a look at Xiaotao’s condition. Yuhao, the three of you shall come along too.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, Teacher.” Huo Yuhao represented the rest and acknowledged Elder Mu. He quickly walked towards Elder Xuan.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen’s gaze changed direction as he heard Huo Yuhao’s name. His name appeared the most in the reports of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. He appeared even more frequently than both Shrek’s team leader Ma Xiaotao and vice-team leader Dai Yueheng.</p>
