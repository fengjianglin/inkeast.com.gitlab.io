It had to be the biggest storage-type soul tool there was! As he saw the sapphire, Huo Yuhao was both delighted and shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t expect his luck to be so good, he had actually obtained such a treasure! He could sense that this metallic man had some capabilities, even though it was only half-complete. Furthermore, there were many formation arrays in this metallic man. It wasn’t beneficial just for him in his research of soul tools. He believed that he could match up to the top-ranked soul engineers in Illustrious Virtue Hall if he managed to completely understand this metallic man. Of course, he would still need a lot of time. But possessing this metallic man meant that he practically owned a soul tool encyclopedia from the Illustrious Virtue Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly put the storage-type soul tool away in his own storage-type soul tool before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had no mood to think about the hundred-thousand year soul embryo at this moment. This metallic man was much more important than the hundred-thousand year soul embryo. He was only thinking of how he should leave this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After rushing out of the tunnel, Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath, and his heart started to beat faster and faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The booms outside seemed to have become softer. The battle between the two parties appeared to have dropped in intensity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What should he do? Should he still take that tunnel? He had no choice. Even if he had to dig after entering the tunnel, he still had a slim chance. With the Ice Empress’ Pincer and Darkgolden Terrorclaws, he was capable of digging another tunnel. If he managed to dig until he reached the rest of the tunnels in the underground base that the Body Sect members had gone into, he could escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sped up as he considered his options. He rushed towards the opening of the tunnel that he had entered earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, a black figure flashed past with an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who’s there?” the other party shouted. An intense purplish light shone, and a frightening, suppressive force caused Huo Yuhao to nearly suffocate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two yellow, two purple, and four black soul rings appeared on the person’s body. He was a Soul Douluo with a pair of thick arms. At this moment, his arms had already turned into a pair of large pincers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up.” Huo Yuhao’s voice was deep and frail. He also removed the veil from his face. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other party was stunned upon seeing the old and frail face that Huo Yuhao had created for himself with his Imitation, and knelt down on one knee, “Greetings, sect master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very nervous now. He knew that he had imitated the right person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other party’s martial soul and dress revealed his identity as a warrior of the Body Sect. He was a Soul Douluo-ranked expert who possessed a Body Soul - his Arms were his Body Soul! How powerful was he? Did he dig the tunnel with his arms?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get your hands on it?” Huo Yuhao asked him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, we did.” The Soul Douluo appeared very excited. He presented something to Huo Yuhao with both hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a white tray. There was a wooden ladle on it with hundreds of gemstones of all colors. A ball of white gas was trembling slightly on this wooden ladle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had last seen this item at the Starlight Auctionplace. How could he forget this top-ranked finale item!? Although he didn’t know how the other party got their hands on it, he was certain that it was a hundred-thousand year soul beast embryo. The Godsealing Altar was definitely real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath and tried to calm down. He snatched the Godsealing Altar from the other party. He set it in front of him and took a good look at it before nodding and saying, “Not bad, you’ve contributed greatly this time. You’ll be greatly rewarded when we return. Go on, leave quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he put the Godsealing Altar away in his own storage-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he immediately realized that he’d failed. His storage-type soul tool couldn’t contain the Godsealing Altar. Huo Yuhao almost slapped himself. How could he forget this? If the classes of soul tools were too far apart, the storage-type soul tool wouldn’t be able to contain a higher-class soul tool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, reverberating booms could be heard from the outside again. The man in black in front of Huo Yuhao stood up quickly, looking very shocked. He pointed his finger at Huo Yuhao and asked, “You, you’re not the sect master?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. “What gibberish are you spouting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man in black turned fierce. “I sensed the sect master’s aura on the outside. You’re an imitation! Go and die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His right arm had already turned into a huge, purple fist as he spoke. He punched straight towards Huo Yuhao’s chest. That instantaneous, explosive force caused the entire tunnel to distort slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used his other hand to reach towards the hundred-thousand year soul beast embryo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the other party claimed that he wasn’t the sect master, Huo Yuhao knew that things had gone wrong. His abilities were far inferior to this Soul Douluo’s. His life was in grave danger now that he had been discovered!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this critical moment, Huo Yuhao displayed what he had learned from the Ultimate Soldier Plan. He did the only thing that was right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of scarlet-gold light surfaced on his body. It was the fifteen-second Invincible Barrier from the Hongchen’s Blessing. His defensive strength increased threefold with this Invincible Barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He also unleashed the Ice Empress’ Armor, though the diamond crystals didn’t release any glow under the disguise of his Imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he unleashed both his defensive capabilities, he used the hundred-thousand year soul embryo to receive the other party’s frightening fist. However, the other party didn’t seem to take any heed as he continued to reach his hand over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hundred-thousand year soul ring and soul bone were a treasure to every soul master. This Soul Douluo never expected that someone would allow this treasure to be damaged after obtaining it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He reckoned that Huo Yuhao’s cultivation must be of a certain standard, or Huo Yuhao wouldn’t have dared to trick him. That’s why he unleashed his entire strength with this punch. It was almost impossible to retract his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the hundred-thousand year soul beast embryo was their main target! Whether it was the hundred million gold coin reward, the soul beast embryo itself, or the Class 9 Godsealing Altar that contained it, they were all valuable treasures. However, he was anxious because Huo Yuhao didn’t seem to care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His left hand reached for his right hand at this moment rather than grabbing towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Body Sect had expended a lot of effort for this plan. They had spent almost two years on their advanced preparations. They had also done their own research on the Godsealing Altar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Godsealing Altar could seal life within it. However, the target must lose all ability to struggle before it could be sealed. Once the target was sealed, even a Titled Douluo couldn’t break out. It was normally used to seal some powerful soul beasts that had lost their fighting strength, but it was used, if rarely, on soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Godsealing Altar wasn’t completely flawless. The seal was sustained by drawing from the trapped person’s soul power. That’s why it was very powerful internally, but was unable to exert any significant external defensive strength. A certain amount of force could cause this Class 9 soul tool to crack. That was why the Godsealing Altar was also known to be soft on the outside, but tough on the inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally had some understanding of the Godsealing Altar. That was why he made such a choice. After obtaining the huge experimental metallic man, he just wanted to leave this place safely. He wasn’t that interested in the hundred- thousand year soul beast embryo, either. He couldn’t absorb a hundred-thousand year soul ring with his current abilities. Furthermore, he didn’t even know what this soul beast’s type was! That was why he’d rather release this soul beast, which also happened to be the only way he could resist the other party’s attack. Otherwise, even Hongchen’s Blessing couldn’t withstand the other party’s attack, considering the gap in their cultivations.</span></p>

He still managed to achieve his goal even though he changed his move at the last moment. His left hand managed to grab hold of his right hand. His body stiffened up, and his right fist stopped right in front of the Godsealing Altar.</span></p>

After all, he had completely unleashed his right fist. He knew that Huo Yuhao would exploit this opportunity to attack him, but he was fairly confident of his own defensive strength. However, something unexpected happened.</span></p>

He smashed the Godsealing Altar towards the other party’s fist. He used all his strength this time, and the strength of the Ice Empress’ Pincer was completely unleashed.</span></p>
