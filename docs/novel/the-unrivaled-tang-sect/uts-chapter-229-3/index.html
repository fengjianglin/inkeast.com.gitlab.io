His Mass Berserk continued to spread, and quickly encompassed all the baboons around him. However, the baboons were not hasty with their attack, and only pushed forward gradually.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air immediately became extremely tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The students from Shrek weren’t panicky or flustered in the least, even though they were facing such a hazardous situation. The Baboon King had fifty thousand years of cultivation, which meant that he was almost equivalent to an eight-ringed Soul Douluo. The humans had two Soul Douluo on their side, and they even had Dean Cai, who was a Titled Douluo, to hold the fort. These Bloody Baboons were difficult to deal with, but it wouldn’t be easy for them to threaten their company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo had shifted behind Zhang Lexuan at this moment. Her Dazzling Golden Rope shimmered into view. However, she didn’t attack her enemies, but wrapped the rope once around her companions’ waists. A powerful control-type soul master didn’t just control his or her enemies, but also had to take care of his or her own people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Baboon King stared at Zhang Lexuan with those ferocious eyes of his, while Zhang Lexuan returned his gaze with a calm expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, the Baboon King roared as he applied strength to his thick and strong lower limbs. His incredibly muscular body immediately barreled towards Zhang Lexuan, while a layer of golden light glimmered on his body. His tremendous forward-moving figure actually appeared faintly surreal and illusory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan’s first and third soul rings lit up at the same time. A streak of moonlight first descended on her body, and she was completely encircled by the radiance, before another beam of moonlight shone on the Baboon King’s body immediately afterwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a loud boom, and the Baboon King’s momentum paused, but he still continued his charge at Zhang Lexuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other baboons charged forward when the Baboon King made his move, and the ten-thousand year Bloody Baboons immediately launched their hysterical assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan placed her hands in front of her chest. The crescent moon behind her burst with light as streak after streak of moonlight blasted down from the sky. She blocked the Baboon King’s forward momentum and four other ten-thousand year baboons at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, she wasn’t the only target, and enemies circled in from all sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two of the ten-thousand year baboons charged toward Huo Yuhao and the others. At this moment, Wang Dong’er was on Huo Yuhao’s right, while Wang Qiu’er was on his left, both of them having removed their veils for the night’s rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two baboons leapt into the sky at the same time, and one of them went straight for Huo Yuhao. It raised placed its elongated hands above its head and clenched them into fists before slamming them straight down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was young, but he was an experienced fighter. Cold light flickered in his eyes as four soul rings rose from beneath him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes instantly turned white as a white light circle spread in all directions: Mass Enfeeblement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement was also like a halo, but it was far stronger than Mo Xuan’s halos. Almost all the Bloody Baboons slowed down in that instant, and the ferocity of their forward momentum was greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bloody Baboons were adept with physical attacks, while Mass Enfeeblement targeted physical bodies, so it could be considered a counter. Mass Berserk had just taken effect on these baboons, but its effects were immediately countered and offset by Mass Enfeeblement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was taking care of the whole battlefield, but he chose to advance instead of retreat as he slipped forward in a flash. His body slid just underneath the ten thousand year baboon’s armpits as he slapped his right hand toward the other one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bloody Baboons’ tactic of choice was to meet force with force. The baboon didn’t even bother evading Huo Yuhao’s attack as it swung its arms out and swept them towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, was Huo Yuhao’s right hand that easy to fight against? When his right hand pressed against the baboon, the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon was immediately used. He didn’t pull, but pushed instead, and he borrowed the baboon’s own strength to bounce backwards rapidly. Five streams of blood spurted out as that ten thousand year Bloody Baboon howled ferociously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dark golden blade glimmered in Huo Yuhao’s right hand; the foot-long blade had been buried entirely in the baboon’s body. Its fur was tough, but it was still a far cry from Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, this baboon was truly fearsome – its ribs were heinously injured, but it hadn’t lost its ability to fight. It began to roar hysterically on the spot while a dense blood essence erupted from its body. It was about to enter Bloodlust mode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had singled out one of the two ten-thousand year Bloody Baboons, so the other one naturally went for Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was focused on Huo Yuhao, and she immediately followed up after Huo Yuhao launched his attack. The Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings stretched out behind her back as the voluminous Light of the Butterfly Goddess burst forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Light of the Butterfly Goddess wasn’t weak, but it was definitely not strong enough to break through the Bloody Baboon’s defenses. All it could do was hinder the baboon’s forward movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er made her move at this moment. A crisp dragon roar could be heard as Wang Qiu’er’s body flared up with riveting and brilliant golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She arrived before the baboon in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The baboon swung its fist at her without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A stunning scene occurred. Wang Qiu’er was such a pretty little lady, but she didn’t use any soul skills at this moment, choosing to meet force with force instead. Her small white fist clashed with the baboon’s dustpan-sized fist in the air, just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s fist turned golden in an instant. Her eyes were incredibly determined and unwavering, and the Bloody Baboon actually halted in its tracks after colliding with her simple punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden light burst out as a shrill cracking sound could be heard. That Bloody Baboon’s arm arched backward in the instant after the collision, but only half of its arm moved. It had such a thick and tough arm, and yet it broke, just like that! The ten-thousand year Bloody Baboon’s forte was meeting force with force, and yet it actually lost the fight, and absolutely so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er seemed to have expected this, and she didn’t pause after launching her fist. She tapped on the ground with the tip of her foot, and her entire body was propelled forward with a boom, as if she were a golden cannon shell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bloody Baboon wanted to use Bloodlust as it howled in agony, while extending the fingers of its other hand to make a grab at Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s body was still in midair, but she didn’t dodge or evade the attack, making the exact same grabbing action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind her, Wang Dong’er didn’t even see how she did it; all she saw was Wang Qiu’er grabbing one of the baboon’s fingers. In the next moment, her forward-moving body suddenly plummeted toward the ground, and she touched down like a five-hundred-kilogram sluice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An even more violent impact could be heard this time, and an intense shockwave erupted from where Wang Qiu’er landed on the ground. She flipped over several other Bloody Baboons that were charging behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Afterwards, she was still grabbing onto that Bloody Baboon’s finger as she hurled its two-meter tall, muscular, and lean body into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, she hurled it into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The ten-thousand year Bloody Baboon was slammed forcefully into the ground, the force of the impact knocking over two other baboons. Wang Qiu’er released that finger, which was broken until it couldn’t be broken any further, and she raised her right fist as two yellow, two purple, and one black soul rings rose from her body. Her first purple soul ring sparkled, and she punched out as a dragon head seemed to flash by in midair and integrate itself into this fist… and this fist rained down onto the Bloody Baboon’s tough skull.</span></p>

Its enormous body was still exuding blood energy as it suddenly stopped, and its legs curved upward before they crashed down heavily once more. The baboon was no longer moving.</span></p>

It began to wave its fists around with all its strength like a windmill, and the first two targets were its partners beside it as it knocked them into the sky.</span></p>

Soul beasts that were under the effects of Bloodlust had their strength greatly amplified, but their intelligence would also be lowered to the minimum; that was the price of Bloodlust. It was easy to imagine how soul beasts would react to Spiritual Confusion when they could no longer maintain their rationality and intelligence.</span></p>

But she had managed to do it; the Golden Dragon truly lived up to its name as the Ancestor of Strength! Furthermore, her strength seemed to be even higher than his previous speculations. Faced with this fearsome draconic prestige, the savage Bloody Baboons seemed a little afraid to come forward...</span></p>
