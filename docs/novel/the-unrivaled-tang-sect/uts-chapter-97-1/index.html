 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 97.1: The Conjecture Regarding Multiple Fusion Skills</strong></p>
 <p>“My last guess, which I think is highly probable, is that there’s him in you and you in him.”</p>
 <p>After he said this, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were stunned. They looked at each other, and Huo Yuhao had a weird look in his eyes. Wang Dong shifted his gaze away the moment their eyes met. His tender face blushed a little.</p>
 <p>“Don’t misinterpret what I’m saying.” Wang Yan snapped at them, “I’m talking about your martial souls, not the both of you. You kids nowadays have such fertile imaginations.”</p>
 <p>“You were the one being ambiguous,” Wang Dong retorted.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan ignored him and continued, “The him in you and you in him that I mentioned refers to the fact that there may be some form of co-existence between your martial souls internally, even though they seem to be unconnected on the surface. It’s a little awkward to put it this way. I’ll give you an example to clarify things.”</p>
 <p>“For example, the Spirit Eyes and Radiant Butterfly Goddess do not seem to be connected to each other. However, what if Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes contain the power of light? This means that Yuhao’s martial soul contains a characteristic of Wang Dong’s martial soul. Let’s shift our attention to the Ice Jade Scorpion and Wang Dong’s strength-type martial soul. I’ve checked, and found out that the strength of the Ice Jade Scorpion is rather powerful. This means that an Ic,e Jade Scorpion possesses strength. This may be a key point why both of your martial souls could fuse together. However, I will still need to research the details further.”</p>
 <p>After hearing Wang Yan’s words, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong pondered them carefully, and their faces gradually showed looks of admiration. Yes! The situation described by Teacher Wang did exist in their bodies, but they hadn’t thought of his point before. In this way, it didn’t seem too unexpected that their martial souls had fused.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan grinned, and his eyes were filled with fanaticism as he said, “Whatever the reason for the fusion of your martial souls, they have already fused. I will continue to research further, but this is not the main point. After all, what’s supposed to have fused has already fused. What I really want to research is the difference between the fusion of your twin martial souls and that of a single martial soul.</p>
 <p>“Both of you have such a high degree of compatibility. This produced the Golden Road, a powerful martial soul fusion skill in terms of control. Then, did the both of you realize that this is only a fusion between your first martial souls!? Since this is the case, will 4 different fusions occur? As the two of you have two martial souls each, this allows for 4 different permutations. Theoretically speaking, there’s the possibility of 4 martial soul fusion skills.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong stared at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes. 4 martial soul fusion skills? What kind of concept was that? If they could possess 4 different skills and use them at the same time, they might be able to challenge a soul king with their current abilities!</p>
 <p>Wang Yan leaned into the sofa and watched their shimmering eyes. “However, don’t be too optimistic. Besides the fact that it’s almost impossible for four martial soul fusion skills to appear, you won’t have the ability to use all four martial soul fusion skills in battle even if they appear. That’s because the power of the martial soul fusion skills will rise along with your cultivations. At the same time, your soul power will be depleted much quicker upon using them. I estimate that the two of you will only be able to use two martial soul fusion skills in a battle, unless some unprecedented situation occurs. Of course, both of your futures will be very bright if more martial soul fusion skills appear.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher Wang, is it really possible? Then what should we do?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan replied, “I’m not sure if it’s really possible. I mentioned before that such a situation has never appeared in the history of soul masters. The reason why I’m proposing this is because I hope for the both of you to try it out. What you have to do is very simple. It’ll still be a fusion of martial souls. However, I hope that both of you can summon a different martial soul during the fusion process. That means both of you should try to summon the single martial soul. There may be a possibility of success.”</p>
 <p>“So it’s that simple!” Wang Dong said.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan chuckled, “What else did you think you had to do? For incompatible martial souls, everything will still be futile even with ten thousand attempts. But for those like you, whose martial souls are compatible, this process is not difficult. Based on the use of the martial soul fusion skill that both of you possess now, I believe that the other three martial soul fusion skills can be unleashed once every 3 days if you are able to succeed at your other 3 fusions. Thus, I shall give you both 9 days. Within 9 days, you’ll have to complete all the experiments. Wang Dong, can you tell me what your second martial soul is?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong hesitated for a moment before nodding his head. Then, he said, “My second martial soul is the Clear Sky Hammer.”</p>
 <p>After hearing the words ‘Clear Sky Hammer’, Wang Yan stood up in shock from the sofa before Huo Yuhao even had a chance to react. “What, the Clear Sky Hammer? It’s actually the Clear Sky Hammer. You are from the Clear Sky Sect?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong nodded his head and replied, “Yes! Why?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan laughed bitterly. “No wonder. The Clear Sky Sect was once the top sect on the continent! Come to think of it, it has a rather close yet complicated relationship with our academy. But as the Tang Sect fell, the Clear Sky Sect hid itself from the world again. If I’m not wrong, a direct disciple should have the surname Tang! Why is your surname Wang then?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong snorted and said, “This is my secret. I can’t tell the both of you. What’s wrong if my surname is Wang? Inheriting the Clear Sky Hammer means that I’m a part of the Clear Sky Sect. Furthermore, the Clear Sky Sect did not really hide itself from the world.”</p>
 <p>“No wonder,” Wang Yan muttered, “Yuhao’s second martial soul is Ultimate Ice. You are compatible with him because you have the most powerful offensive tool on the continent. I am really looking forward to the other martial soul fusion skills that can be created between the both of you. I suggest that the both of you try to fuse the Clear Sky Hammer and Ice Jade Scorpion first. These are two martial souls that have not been used in your current martial soul fusion skill. After this, the two of you should try fusing the Clear Sky Hammer and Spirit Eyes, as well as the Ice Jade Scorpion and Radiant Butterfly Goddess.”</p>
 <p>“Teacher Wang, is it possible for 3 or even all 4 martial souls to fuse together at the same time?” Huo Yuhao asked suddenly.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan jumped in shock, and hurriedly said, “No. Don’t ever attempt that, at least not now. It’s not easy to tell what will arise from that kind of situation. However, a martial soul fusion skill causes a great depletion of power. Once you attempt a fusion of such a degree, both of your powers may be depleted even if you succeed. To be safe, only consider such an attempt when your cultivations reach six rings. As long as you succeed with one of the three combinations that I proposed, there will be extra changes in your strategy for the latter stages of the tournament.”</p>
 <p>“3 rounds have already been completed in the round robin stage. We have also met our strongest competitor in our small group, which was the Justsky Academy. The remaining 4 rounds won’t be too difficult for us either. Especially for tomorrow’s competition, since Ling Luochen has already recovered from her injuries and can participate. After one more round, Ma Xiaotao and Dai Yueheng will also recover. With the return of these 3 official team members, it won’t be too difficult for us, at least during the round robin stage. The two of you should think on how you can unleash a brand new martial soul fusion skill.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Teacher Wang, we will do our best. However, please keep this a secret for us.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan nodded and said, “Naturally. I may not even let you use your new martial soul fusion skill even if you succeed. After all, you will carry the responsibility of handling the Shrek Academy Tournament in 5 years’ time.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Teacher Wang, can you give me that Soul-Devouring Carving Knife? I am a spiritual-type soul master. When I bid for that carving knife, I had a feeling that it had some sort of special connection to me. I’m sure it won’t harm us.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan shook his head and said, “No, I can’t. The two of you are the pride of our academy. Even if there’s only a slight danger, I still must keep you away from it. It’s not too late for you to try using it under the guidance of your teacher from the soul tool department when we return to the academy. You can’t possibly make a soul tool right now.”</p>
 <p>“I…” Huo Yuhao was helpless, and could only forget his wish to obtain the Soul-Devouring Carving Knife.</p>
 <p>After bidding goodbye to Wang Yan, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong returned to Huo Yuhao’s room excitedly. However, they couldn’t possibly try a new martial soul fusion skill right now. They had just unleashed the Golden Road yesterday, and their bodies had not yet recovered fully. If they were not at their peak states, it was less likely for their martial soul fusion to succeed. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao had already expended all his energy. Hence, their priority now was to recover.</p>
 <p>As the Haodong Power was initiated, they entered a state of cultivation very quickly. In their hearts, they were yearning for the creation of a new martial soul fusion skill.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan’s words seemed to have opened a door for them. Even though they had not attempted it yet, the two of them had the feeling that they would succeed.</p>
 <p>Gloomy clouds filled the sky. Rounds after round of the Continental Advanced Soul Duelling Tournament continued. As of yesterday, the third round of the tournament had already ended. There were only 1 or 2 teams that managed to ensure perfect winning streaks in each small group.</p>
 <p>With the results of the first 3 rounds of competition in, the situation was much clearer. The traditional powerhouses pulled away from the rest, and the team that evoked the most debate was still the top academy of the continent, Shrek Academy!</p>
