 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

As they flew out over the deep sea, some seagull-type oceanic soul beasts attacked Huo Yuhao and his team. However, they were not powerful enough to threaten the group and were easily dealt with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they skirted around the two navies and entered the territory of the Sun Moon Empire, Huo Yuhao directed his team to fly closer to the shoreline before flying ahead. They did not rest. When the soul power of their flying-type soul tools was depleted to a certain extent, they would immediately replenish them with filled Sealed Milk Bottles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they flew for another four hours, they soon approached Huo Yuhao’s second designated location. This was a city near the southern coast of the Sun Moon Empire called Seajoy City. Seajoy City was located near the southern sea of the Sun Moon Empire and could be considered a big city. It was built on the Sun Moon Empire’s greatest natural port, Sun Moon Harbor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While ships could not enter the deep sea, progress in soul engineering technology ensured that ships sailing near the coast would be safe. After all, transport by sea was easier than transport by land, as it required less manpower and logistics. It would, however, require a greater upfront investment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could see Sun Moon Harbor in the distance. However, Huo Yuhao did not fly there straightaway with his companions. Instead, they landed near the coast around five kilometers away from Sun Moon Harbor and Seajoy City. There, everyone changed into the style of clothing worn by the people of the Sun Moon Empire. Only then did they head toward Seajoy City on foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seajoy City could not compare with Radiant City or Shrek City. Relative to the cities of the continent, it was considered medium-sized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps because of its rather inaccessible location, Seajoy City’s security was much less strict. Huo Yuhao and the rest were able to enter it easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seajoy City’s buildings were different from those in the inland cities of the Sun Moon Empire. The city did not have the tall buildings of Radiant City, but more of the characteristics of a fishing village by the sea. They all looked extremely sturdy, as they were probably designed to withstand sea storms. The buildings of Seajoy City were all located on higher ground, while Sun Moon Harbor was located on a downward slope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

After flying for almost half a day, they needed time to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qiuqiu, come and walk with me,” Huo Yuhao gestured to Nan Qiuqiu.</span></p>

Why me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s faced darkened as he said, “What did I say before we came out? You have to obey all orders. If you don’t want to listen to my instructions, you can go back by yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu stuck out her tongue and said crossly, “There’s no need to be so fierce. I’ll go with you!” As she said that, she shot an odd look at Ye Guyi. Ye Guyi blushed, and her hips moved slightly. Then, Nan Qiuqiu ran out with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Take this time to rest, guys. In the meantime, you can replenish the soul power in our Sealed Milk Bottles. We’ll come back soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi said, “Go, we’ll be fine here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao did not dare to delay. He was afraid of this young mistress. Heaven knew what kind of trouble she would cause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He followed her outside and saw that she was not far away. Only then did he relax. He rushed over and said, “Come, hold my arm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu was startled. She jumped to one side as she stared at him warily and said, “What are you doing? Don’t even think about taking advantage of me! Back in the hotel, there’s someone who’s dying for you to do that to her. What’s wrong? Have you fallen for me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao slapped his forehead and said helplessly, “Can you stop being so perverted? Do you want to save your mother or not?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu said angrily, “Saving my mother doesn’t mean I have to sacrifice my virtue! Stop using this to threaten me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The muscles on Huo Yuhao’s face twitched as he said, “Okay, fine. Go back and get Ye Guyi to come. Tell her that we need to pretend to be a couple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pretend to be a couple? For what?” Nan Qiuqiu’s wariness was replaced by curiosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said angrily, “This is our disguise! We pretend to be a couple to gather information. If not, why would I want you to hold my arm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should have made yourself clearer,” Nan Qiuqiu replied with a snort. Only then did she shuffle over unwillingly and she held his arm. However, she grabbed the inner portion of his shirt with two of her fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “Sometimes I feel that it was a mistake for elder brother to let you tag along. Let’s go.” As he said that, he strode forward with big steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu’s mouth twitched as she said, “I’m a proper girl. What if I become pregnant pretending to be your girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao almost stumbled and fell. His arm trembled as he pushed Nan Qiuqiu’s hand to one side as he said, “Fine, you win, mistress. Let’s pretend to be brother and sister, alright? You won’t have to ‘suffer’ so much like this. I’m truly in awe at how you think holding hands can lead to pregnancy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, he ignored her as he continued to walk forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oi! Why are you so fierce? This time, you’re in the wrong! There’s no way for you to pretend to be my older brother. I should be your elder sister instead! I’m older than you! Oi, stop walking so fast, wait for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was afraid that he might really blow his top because of Nan Qiuqiu, and hence he walked ahead quickly. In his heart, he felt frustrated and helpless, but a smile crept across his face. This seemingly dumb and proud girl was indeed interesting. Ever since Dong’er fell into a deep slumber, he was finally able to relax a bit, even though it was because he was dealing with such petty issues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

He also bought a map of Seajoy City and its Sun Moon Harbor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu ultimately decided to be his girlfriend. While she did not like it, she held his hand.</span></p>

They don’t look very tasty! Speaking of food, your grilled fish yesterday was excellent. Make more next time, it’s praiseworthy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said in a low voice, “I don’t need your praise. From now on, try not to talk. Just smile.”</span></p>

He did not enter it immediately, but instead turned to look at Nan Qiuqiu and said, “After we enter, say nothing, is that clear? Listen to my instructions. If not, you can go back.”</span></p>

Huo Yuhao was quite sensitive to this. Qiu’er and Dong’er were already fighting for him. He could not blame Qiu’er for it, but he definitely did not want anyone else to fall for him!</span></p>

The main hall was wide; at least four hundred square meters in area. There were ten counters, all of which were manned by busy staff. It was not particularly clean, and one could smell the reek of salt rot. Nan Qiuqiu could not help but frown. Huo Yuhao pinched her, stopping her from complaining about the place.</span></p>

How much will it cost?” Pegasus Harbor was located near the eastern seaboard of the Sun Moon Empire. It was near the Star Luo Empire’s naval base, which faced the Sun Moon Empire’s fleet. It was the easternmost port of the Sun Moon Empire and was just a bit smaller than Sun Moon Harbor.</span></p>
