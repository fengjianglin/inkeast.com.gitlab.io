 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The height of the highest mountain peak in the Ming Dou Mountain Range had fallen by at least a hundred meters. There was a huge depression at the top of the mountain, filled with smaller craters. Even though the clash was already over, the entire mountain was still engulfed by strong soul power undulations. Occasionally, the cries of avenging spirits could be heard as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao!” Xu Sanshi immediately spotted Huo Yuhao lying in the center of the huge depression, and rushed towards him. Everyone from Shrek Academy did the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earlier clash at the top of this mountain was too intense. They had no idea what had happened, but the Death God Pagoda had vanished at this moment. The Death God Douluo had also disappeared, and only Huo Yuhao remained. After the flashes of red light earlier, the soul engineers of the Sun Moon Empire quickly fled after being momentarily shocked. They left with whatever soul tools they could bring with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although more than ten Titled Douluo from the Star Luo Empire were here, their advantage in numbers didn’t give them an advantage. A combined attack from many soul tools would still threaten them greatly. Seeing that their enemies had fled, they naturally didn’t pursue them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Victory? If they had really achieved victory, it was a victory that belonged to the twenty of them! Among them, Huo Yuhao had played the most critical role.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Titled Douluo witnessed the Death God Douluo’s immense abilities, they were all shocked. They clearly knew that they couldn’t overcome such a powerful enemy, even with their numerical advantage. Moreover, Ye Xishui had the Death God Pagoda to rely on. If they continued fighting, they would have all been decimated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was at that moment when Huo Yuhao’s unexplained power managed to resist the Death God Douluo. They didn’t witness the fighting process, but the final result did sort of indicate that Huo Yuhao hadn’t lost. The Death God Douluo and Death God Pagoda had disappeared, and the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineers had retreated too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant that the Ming Dou Mountain Range had been won back. To the Star Luo Empire, this was extremely important. With the Ming Dou Mountain Range falling back into the hands of the Star Luo Empire, the Sun Moon Empire would find it very difficult to reclaim it again and reinvade the Star Luo Empire. Furthermore, the Sun Moon Empire lacked leadership right now. Now that the Star Luo Empire had overcome their first defensive line, it was time for them to make further headway!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the Titled Douluo were excited right now, but everyone from Shrek Academy looked very serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they surrounded Huo Yuhao, they only saw how blood-soaked his clothes were. Blood was oozing from all his pores, and his aura had become very weak. They couldn’t even sense any soul power undulations from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi looked very serious, and squatted down beside Huo Yuhao. He carefully placed his hand on his chest to sense Huo Yuhao’s condition. After a brief moment, he furrowed his brow and stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is he, Third Senior?” Ye Guyi asked anxiously. Tears were already forming in her eyes. Even though she had already suppressed her feelings for Huo Yuhao, she still felt that she was about to experience an emotional outburst upon seeing that he was seriously wounded and on the verge of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi solemnly replied, “Not good. Little junior’s life aura is very weak and his heartbeat is so slow it’s almost undetectable. He might die at any moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, wake up. Yuhao…” Ye Guyi squatted down beside Huo Yuhao and started sobbing as she pleaded for him to regain consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen also furrowed his brow. “Is there no other way?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi shook his head and said, “I did a preliminary check on his condition, and it seems like all his passageways have been broken. They even seem to be seriously damaged. I don’t even dare to touch him right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Ziyan was the calmest among all of them. She immediately turned around and faced all the Titled Douluos, asking, “Elders, which one of you is adept at healing? Please take a look at Yuhao. He’s in very bad condition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, all of the Titled Douluo were jolted from their excitement, and quickly surrounded Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all of these Titled Douluo that were chosen for this mission were adept at attacking. None of them were adept at healing! After checking Huo Yuhao’s condition, all of them came to the same conclusion as Xu Sanshi. Huo Yuhao was in very bad condition. All his passageways were seriously injured. If it was someone else with such serious injuries, he would have died. However, there was some kind of special force in his body that was helping him hang on. The circulation of his blood seemed to have stopped completely, apart from a small region around his heart. As for his soul power, it had long disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, all the Titled Douluo were helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shattered Star Douluo said, “Yuhao’s injury is very serious. Let’s not touch him for now. Let’s go and rendezvous with the army first. Giant Hammer, make a trip back and immediately ask the Marshal to send a healing-type soul master over. I’ll stand guard here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” the Giant Hammer Douluo acknowledged, turning around before flying away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had made an important contribution this time by helping to reclaim the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Even these arrogant Titled Douluo were in awe of him. They were also very shocked by the secret force that was keeping him alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even without saying anything, they knew that he had borrowed some kind of strength that didn’t belong to him to fight the Death God Douluo, scaring her away. His body was seriously wounded because he couldn’t handle such great power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the Titled Douluo thought that it was no mean feat that Huo Yuhao could preserve his life. He was dealing with a powerful force that could resist an Ultimate Douluo! Even Titled Douluo like them weren’t confident of remaining alive if they had to deal with such a powerful force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also stood beside Huo Yuhao. She didn’t wail as pitifully as Ye Guyi. She only stood where she was, looking a little dazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene of Huo Yuhao exchanging places with her when the Light of Death God descended on her earlier kept on repeating itself in her mind. She kept on asking herself this question,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were me, would I be capable of doing the same thing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong knew that this name had been permanently imprinted in her mind right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The healing-type soul master team arrived at almost the same time as the soul master legion that was here to reclaim the mountain range. Everyone was shocked that the White Tiger Duke had personally come, and even brought along a healing-type Titled Douluo. There were also about sixteen other healing-type soul masters with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where’s Yuhao?” The White Tiger Duke led this large group of healing-type soul masters as they descended from the sky. The first thing he asked when he landed was Huo Yuhao’s location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shattered Star Douluo’s expression changed when he saw that the White Tiger Duke was personally here. It was important to know that the White Tiger Duke was very crucial to the Star Luo Empire’s military. If the Death God Douluo returned, they would be unable to protect him at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Duke, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke lifted his hand and stopped the Shattered Star Douluo from speaking any further. Of course he understood what the Shattered Star Douluo meant. He said, “It’s more important to save this life first. We can leave the rest for later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, and the rest quickly came up to receive him. The White Tiger Duke led the healing-type soul masters to Huo Yuhao under their guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The healing-type Titled Douluo was an elder with white hair and a wrinkled face. It was impossible to tell her actual age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she arrived in front of Huo Yuhao, she lifted her right hand and a streak of dim-green light instantly turned into a barrier of light that engulfed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Duke, you must save Yuhao.” Xu Sanshi’s voice started to tremble slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, I’ll try my best. Yuhao is a great servant to our empire!” the White Tiger Duke said without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, he could only see the explosions of light that had blossomed from the top of the mountain. When they first started, he started to tense up. Without a doubt, Huo Yuhao had already been discovered. Being discovered was an unavoidable consequence of the plan. The key lay in whether Huo Yuhao was able to free all the Titled Douluo after being discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the most important thing to take note of was the amount of time the explosions lasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t disappoint him. The lights didn’t disappear, and even larger explosions ensued. At that point, the White Tiger Duke was already ready to command his entire military to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, the White Tiger Duke saw terrifying red light flashing at the top of the mountain. The black light that Huo Yuhao had released wasn’t very clear against the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the White Tiger Duke was astonished when he saw that the mountain had collapsed slightly. Huo Yuhao had succeeded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even without any signal, the White Tiger Duke had already given the order to attack. The Giant Hammer Douluo returned not long after that, and relayed news that Huo Yuhao had been seriously wounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For some unknown reason, the White Tiger Duke felt his heart constricting after learning that Huo Yuhao had been seriously hurt. He ignored Princess Jiujiu’s attempt to stop him and personally led a team of healing-type soul masters to save him. He only had one thought in his mind: save Huo Yuhao at all costs! Such a talent was simply too important to the Star Luo Empire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides his desire to save a generational talent, the White Tiger Duke didn’t realize that deep down in his heart, there was some kind of unexplained attachment that was growing. Even he himself wasn’t clear what it was. His concern for Huo Yuhao had already surpassed the sort of brotherly love he had for his own subordinates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi clenched her fists tightly and prayed to herself. Nan Qiuqiu also clasped her hands together in front of her chest, and was reciting something to herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke softly said, “Yuhao will be fine. Don’t worry. This person performing the healing on Yuhao is the Hallmaster of the Star Luo Empire’s Imperial Shrine. He’s a Titled Douluo. As long as someone is still breathing, she can save him. Perhaps all of you have heard of her before. Her name is Wang Xian’er.”</span></p>
