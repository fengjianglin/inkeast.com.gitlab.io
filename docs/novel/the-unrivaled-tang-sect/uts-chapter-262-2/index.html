That meant that he temporarily possessed the strength of a soul sage. What was happening? Strange things had been happening over and over again ever since they had entered the Icefire Yin Yang Well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress glanced at Huo Yuhao. Her eyes were a little complicated. Her look seemed a little intimate and friendly, but there was also a little bit of contempt and rejection. However, she only gave him a single glance before she turned towards the Blazing Delicate Apricot beneath her. The Snow Empress snorted coldly as she descended toward the giant flower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress raised her hands, and the icy-white water from the Extreme Chill Icespring erupted a hundred meters into the air as it became the Snow Empress’ background. Howling winds billowed above the Icefire Yin Yang Well in the next moment as snowflakes waltzed through the air. The entire area around them immediately became enveloped in a whiteness that only snow could produce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dome of light separated the Extreme Chill Icespring under the Snow Empress’ control, and it forcibly suppressed the Blazing Sunspring beneath it so that the hot spring’s heat was completely blocked off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady’s expression was icy as the Icespring’s aura surged into her body rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still hovering in midair, and he felt as if his body were swelling up as the Snow Lady continued to absorb the Icespring’s energy. No matter how much autonomy and consciousness the Snow Empress’ spirit had, she still had to rely on the host that she had signed a contract with. The Snow Empress’ aura continued to rise, but Huo Yuhao was almost reaching his limit. Huo Yuhao’s body reached the point where it might explode from the overwhelming and terrifying Ultimate Ice if this was allowed to continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t take it anymore, Snow Empress!” Huo Yuhao shouted at the top of his lungs. If he died, the Snow Empress would no longer have a host, and she would perish as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress glanced at him, but she didn’t seem to hear him as she pointed at him with her right hand. The little Snow Lady’s familiar dark-blue ice burst out, except it was exponentially larger than before, and it ended up beneath Huo Yuhao’s feet before it froze into an enormous ice pedestal in midair, supporting his body so that he wouldn’t fall. That ice pedestal hovered there along with the blizzard around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Large amounts of ice and snow were falling to the ground. The plants around the Icespring were still alright, as they liked the cold, but the plants near the Sunspring no longer had the Sunspring’s heat. They were starting to tremble in response to the Ultimate Ice’s extremely low temperature, and most of them began to release their own auras to resist the ice and snow descending from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt as if his own blood was freezing, and his body was swelling to the point where it began to crackle. However, there was nothing he could do as the Snow Empress continued to unleash her aura. The gap in their abilities was simply too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress descended from the sky towards the Blazing Delicate Apricot. The hundred-thousand year immortal herb was absolutely stunned at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you…” The Blazing Delicate Apricot no longer had the Sunspring’s support, and her aura was a lot weaker than before. Furthermore, the Snow Empress was bearing down on her the sky, and the hundred-thousand year plant felt a little stifled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the true Empress’ Chill, and it had blanketed the entire Icefire Yin Yang Well. The toxic miasma in the air was blown high into the sky from all the cold energy, and couldn’t come back down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress stared coldly at the Blazing Delicate Apricot and said, “Weren’t you feeling a little complacent before this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She waved her right hand through the air as she spoke, and a dark-blue blade that seemed like it was going to slice the entire world into pieces flickered before it vanished. The fire lady beside the Blazing Delicate Apricot disappeared into a stream of smoke, and the entire area around the Blazing Delicate Apricot was swiftly tainted with icy-blue colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was just a test, it was a test which that person left behind! You… what are you trying to do? You can’t touch me! You will be condemned and scourged by the heavens!” The Blazing Delicate Apricot’s voice was starting to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress that had appeared wasn’t the real Snow Empress, but she drew upon the Extreme Chill Icespring’s immense origin energy to temporarily possess the strength that she had when she was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had been kidnapped by humans just as she chose to be reborn as a human, and she ended up in Jing Hongchen’s hands before Huo Yuhao rescued her. She experienced the polar reversal afterwards and eventually became Huo Yuhao’s spirit. It wasn’t hard to imagine the grievances and suffocation in her heart. The Snow Empress had once reigned supreme in the Extreme North, but she eventually became a human’s bound spirit! Even though she was grateful to Huo Yuhao for rescuing her, how could she reconcile this with the deep frustration in her heart?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Punished? Ha ha ha ha, scourged by the heavens!?” The Snow Empress’ voice grew high-pitched and shrill. Even so, her voice was still as enchanting as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Punishment! I have been punished six times, and I am where I am today because I had to avoid the seventh time. You dare to speak of punishment to me?! Very well… I will settle your punishment before anything else, then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress gradually raised her right hand as she spoke. Her palm seemed like it weighed several tons as the torrential ice and snow in the air began to spin in a clockwise direction. It didn’t take long before a colossal and incredibly frightening tornado of ice and snow formed above the Icefire Yin Yang Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snowless Glacier of the Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques! If this palm was allowed to come down, it would possess the Snow Empress’ full power! The Snow Empress possessed seven hundred thousand years of cultivation, and she was ranked number three amongst the Ten Great Savage Beasts. She was also the leader of the Extreme North’s Three Heavenly Kings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” The Delicate Silk Immortal exclaimed in the distance. She wasn’t the only one that reacted, as more than twenty immortal herbs shone with intense light around the Icefire Yin Yang Well. This light swiftly congregated in the air as an enormous barrier resisting the terrifying tornado of ice and snow that was about to fall from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress grunted coldly as she raised her right hand until her palm was pointing towards the sky. It felt as if she were a ruler who was about to descend upon the world as she muttered coldly, “Do you actually think you can stop me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, Snow Empress!” Huo Yuhao’s hoarse voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress’ body quivered faintly. Even though she had recovered her memory and her powers, she was still Huo Yuhao’s spirit after all. She could feel that Huo Yuhao’s body was about to fall apart, so she no longer absorbed the Extreme Chill Icespring’s origin energy. She couldn’t entirely resist Huo Yuhao’s will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up! Have you forgotten how they’ve treated you?” the Snow Empress asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao struggled to reply, “This is a paradise for plants, and the heavens have gifted the Douluo Continent with the miraculous Icefire Yin Yang Well. Furthermore, I have to find the Yearning Heartbroken Grass for Dong’er to save her life. I refuse to continue living if she dies. When that happens, you will die, and even the Ice Empress won’t be revived. Don’t hurt them, Snow Empress. They meant no ill toward me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s other words didn’t affect her much, but when he said “Ice Empress”, the Snow Empress’ body finally quivered once more before she brought down the palm that had been raised high in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her large and beautiful, but fearsome and murderous eyes were fixed upon the trembling Blazing Delicate Apricot. “Has he passed the test?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, yes! He has passed the test!” The Blazing Delicate Apricot wasn’t stubborn, and she could only swallow this humiliation in the face of a stronger force. She was facing the Snow Empress directly, and the Snow Empress’ element was a natural counter to her own. The Blazing Delicate Apricot was almost unable to resist the intense chill any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress raised her hand and mercilessly reached into the center of the Blazing Delicate Apricot’s flower. It looked as if a beautiful lady was reaching through another lady’s neckline before she violently grabbed and rubbed a few times inside. When the Snow Empress withdrew her hand, there was a red and transparent rubbery item in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rubbery object still caused the air around it to contort a little even though it was being suppressed by the Snow Empress’ formidable powers. It was not difficult to imagine how frighteningly hot this object was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… please don’t take everything! Leave some for me…” the Blazing Delicate Apricot pled pathetically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph! You can create a single drop every year with your current cultivation. You can’t do anything with it even if you keep it.” The Snow Empress embodied the meaning of unreasonable as she pinched with her right hand, and the red spherical rubbery object immediately froze.

Her body was still twitching and quivering, as if she were a human reeling from the heartache of losing something precious.</span></p>

I can tear your body apart to retrieve it, or you can give it to me yourself! With your current cultivation, you can create another one within ten thousand years!”</span></p>
