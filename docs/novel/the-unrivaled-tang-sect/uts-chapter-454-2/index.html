 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Huo Yuhao returned from his contemplation and said, “We should go back as quickly as possible. The Star Luo Empire isn’t being aggressively pressured by the Sun Moon Empire on this side, after all, and they can stabilize themselves for the time being. However, the Heavenly Soul Empire is probably in deep trouble. With the Death God Douluo around, I don’t think the Star Luo Empire can be that effective even if they push into the Sun Moon Empire’s territory. The Academy probably has to make other plans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi said, “Alright. You don’t have to worry about so much, your recovery is most important. Stop talking and take a rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright,” Huo Yuhao shut his eyes once more, and quietly felt the changes in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body had almost exploded from the pressure after he overused the strength of the Beast God Di Tian’s, but all that wasn’t without benefit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God was controlling him back then, but Huo Yuhao’s consciousness was still very much awake. Therefore, he could entirely feel how frighteningly powerful the Beast God was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was what it felt like to be an Ultimate Douluo. This experience allowed Huo Yuhao to feel the aura of a top-tier individual before he had attained the necessary power and cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could even feel that the Beast God had infused about eighty percent of his true body’s soul power into him. Huo Yuhao’s passageways were all saturated when that happened, and his tremendous life energy couldn’t keep up with the terrifying destructive power. This was the case even after the reverse scale that the Beast God had given him bore the brunt of the pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That memory was extremely vivid and deep for him. He realized back then that Di Tian’s soul power was different from his. Huo Yuhao was a Soul Sage, and his soul power was like sticky liquid that circulated when and how he wanted it to. His soul power’s density, purity, regenerative effects, and sustainability were all relatively good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Di Tian’s soul power was like tiny black holes connected together. Every hole contained frightening spatial power, while each unique space contained unimaginably terrifying strength… yet everything was within Di Tian’s control!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had thought to himself back then,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is that the power of an Ultimate Douluo?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was very difficult for the human body to contain such terrifying and extraordinary soul power, and having to rely on spatial power to contain their soul power. Furthermore, that spatial power had to take effect within one’s own body. Everything was just so strange and mystical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian mentioned spatial power when he was battling Ye Xishui, and it was obviuos that she wasn’t as good with spatial power as Di Tian was. They were two of the most powerful individuals in the world, but there was still quite a gap between them. Huo Yuhao could feel that if Di Tian’s true body were present, Ye Xishui would still ultimately be no match for Di Tian even if she leveraged the Death Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian wasn’t known as the most powerful individual in the world for no reason!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had told his four Spirits that his future aim was to challenge the Beast God and ultimately defeat him, before he attempted to sense the call from the God realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao realized after his experience that he still had a long way to go. He was just too far away in comparison to the most powerful individuals in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a rare prodigy. However, was any individual who could become a Titled Douluo not a prodigy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui, Mu En, and Long Xiaoyao were the most talented individuals of their generation. Huo Yuhao still had a long ways to go if he wanted to catch up with them, much less surpass them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s power replayed in his mind. Huo Yuhao didn’t feel discouraged because of it. Instead, an intense desire was ignited in his heart: the desire to become more powerful, to become stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, for some reason, he realized after he had passed out twice that his spiritual state would improve every time he came to. During both times he was unconscious, he felt as if Dong’er had returned to his side, and that sensation felt extremely real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it can be like that every time I pass out, then I don’t mind even if I have to pass out every day!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued to think as the corners of his mouth curled into a faint smile. He channeled his spiritual power and looked at his current state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The passageways in his body were reconnected, and dense life energy was surging through them, while his blood was flowing very smoothly. His soul power began to recover by itself after his passageways healed, such was the strength of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s power wasn’t something that just anyone could take. He had used Yuhao’s body as a foundation in battle, and even if another Titled Douluo was in his place, he or she probably wouldn’t be in as good a shape as Huo Yuhao was. Even a Titled Douluo might explode from all the pressure, let alone a Soul Sage like Huo Yuhao. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s reconnected passageways had turned green from all that life energy nourishing them. There was no question that most of that tremendous life energy originated from his Life Guardian Blade, rather than his own veins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Life Guardian Blade had evolved completely after it consumed the Life Gold. It was a small carving knife at the start, but now it had evolved into a dagger. It was nourished continuously within his body, and even Di Tian couldn’t feel its existence. Di Tian had used his own strength to protect Huo Yuhao’s organs after his body was severely hurt. Damaged passageways weren’t much, and the power in Huo Yuhao’s veins was enough for his passageways to recover by themselves. However, Huo Yuhao would have been in deep trouble if his organs had erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Di Tian didn’t know was that the power of Huo Yuhao’s Life Guardian Blade was unleashed again after it was guided by the Immortal Doctor Douluo’s life energy. That pure life energy had baptized Huo Yuhao’s body once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its effects this time were almost the same as when Huo Yuhao had first fused with it. His damaged passageways contained even more life energy. His healed passageways became tougher, and were filled with even more life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this state continued, Huo Yuhao felt that he could return to normal in just three more days, at most!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The experience of fighting against the Death God was exceptionally precious for him. At the same time, he understood that the protection that the Beast God’s reverse scale conferred to him wasn’t absolute. He was lucky this time; if Ye Xishui hadn’t been overly sensitive, he probably would have been in deep trouble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he was faced with a normal Titled Douluo, his body would be severely injured from the burden it would have taken, even if the Beast God defeated the Titled Douluo for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking about everything in hindsight was scary, but it wasn’t a bad thing for Huo Yuhao. At least he was able to judge how much strength the Beast God could channel into his body, and how much his body could take. This would very beneficial for his attempts to utilize the Beast God’s power in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God didn’t just do bad things after he had bestowed the reverse scale upon him; he finally did something good. However, Huo Yuhao still reminded himself constantly that he couldn’t draw upon the Beast God’s power if he could afford it. Otherwise, he would develop a reliance on it, and that would hinder his future improvements and cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul power continued circulating through his body. Huo Yuhao used his spiritual power to control a small part of his soul power before he circulated it in his dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao recounted again and again what it was like when the Beast God had channeled soul power into his body. If he could create a black hole like that, would his cultivation improve more quickly? Even if his cultivation didn’t improve, what would it be like for his explosiveness in battle?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao began to circulate that thread of soul power in his dantian as he contemplated. He whirled and compressed it. That seemed like where the Beast God’s secret lay, except utilizing spatial power was still a mystery to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thread of soul power wasn’t that powerful, but it began to whirl increasingly quickly as Huo Yuhao deliberately controlled it with his spiritual power. This soul power was gradually compressed. At the beginning it was like a fist, but it was gradually compressed into the size of a chicken egg, and then a hawthorn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could clearly feel that his liquid soul power felt like it was going to solidify after it had reached that level. Its rotation speed began to slow down from to the compression process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s happening? Is my method wrong? But Di Tian’s soul power was clearly formed by small black holes that were rotating at high speed! Every black hole contained spatial power and immense soul power. Is there something wrong with how I’m compressing the soul power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao infused even more spiritual power as he thought things over, and forced that soul power to continue rotating more quickly. However, he was careful not to compress it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could gradually feel that something wasn’t right. This thread of soul power was rotating even more quickly after his full effort, but solid grains began to appear in it. Those grains began to absorb the rest of the soul power inside his dantian as they rotated, strengthening themselves. Those whirlpools that had been compressed to the size of hawthorns began to enlarge once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately sensed that something wasn’t right. He instantly increased his control over his spiritual power to make the whirlpools rotate more slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luckily, it was him. If another Soul Sage was in his place, that person couldn’t possibly have extra spiritual power after adjusting his or her control over their soul power time and time again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul power’s rotation speed slowed, and its absorption of external soul power naturally weakened. Its volume stopped increasing, but the solidified soul power also began to slowly melt and become liquid once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the thread of soul power returned to normal under Huo Yuhao’s careful control, and returned all the soul power in his dantian. It continued circulating according to the Mysterious Heaven Technique’s cultivation pathways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was utterly confused after his experiment. He couldn’t possibly ask the Beast God, as Di Tian would be extremely happy that his soul power was increasing more slowly. Why would Di Tian possibly tell him such a secret? However, the way Di Tian circulated his own soul power left a deep impression in Huo Yuhao’s mind, and he could faintly feel that such a way of circulating soul power was the method he would ultimately reach.</span></p>
