 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he walked off, a Titled Douluo from the Dou Ling Empire couldn’t help but comment, “This kid is too arrogant. Although he’s capable, it’s still…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up.” The Heavenly Sun Douluo turned grim. “He’s not just capable. When we were his age, we were nothing yet. His future is unlimited. In addition, are we really comfortable with using a kid to threaten our enemy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke sighed and said, “Heavenly Sun, what suggestions do you have? What should we do next?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo pondered for a moment before replying, “We should send a letter to the Sun Moon Empire under the name of our three empires and ask them to return the territories that they have taken from the Heavenly Soul Empire. At the same time, there should also be a contract that prohibits any war from being started within the next hundred years. We’ll then return the Crown Prince to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, the White Tiger Duke was stunned, and smiled bitterly. “Elder Heavenly Sun, those conditions are a little too…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo said, “There’s always a price to pay. If we don’t set higher demands, how will we have the room to negotiate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was a little conflicted right now. As he looked at the little fellow in his arms, he was at a loss as to what to do. He was someone with children, and not just one child. Even though he had killed many people in his life before, he still couldn’t help but sigh in his heart when he saw a child in his arms in addition to what Huo Yuhao had said earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao appeared much calmer after he returned to his room. He didn’t utter a word and only sat on his bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong accompanied him and sat beside him. She grabbed his hand and placed it between her hands. After this, she lowered her head and said, “Yuhao, go and do what you want to do. No matter what your decision is, I’ll always be on your side. Even if…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke until here, she lifted her head to look at him. Huo Yuhao was also gazing at her by now. As their gazes met, the look in Tang Wutong’s eyes became sharper. “Even if you make the entire world your enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s entire body shook, and he pulled her into his embrace. His voice was trembling, “Alright, even if I make the entire world my enemy!” In his mind, both little Yunhan and the White Tiger Duke’s face kept on appearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi, don’t worry. I’ll definitely return your son to you. The war should never involve harming a little kid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the future, we’ll be enemies and I’ll do my best to resist the Sun Moon Empire on the battlefield. However, I won’t let your kid come to any harm now. He’s only a kid. In my heart, he isn’t just some Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky slowly turned dark. It was extremely dark on the mountains at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two figures silently appeared at the peak of the mountain, peering into the distance amidst the thick night fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was beside Huo Yuhao, helping to neaten his shirt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression was very calm, but he clearly knew that this path that he had chosen would most likely change his future. However, he was very certain about his decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong gently leaned on him and revealed a satisfied look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, do you know what I’m thinking of?” Tang Wutong asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a strong nostalgic look in Tang Wutong’s eyes. “Initially, you were still so small and weak when we first came to Shrek Academy. However, you defeated me using your persistence. Then, you left a deep impression in my mind. After that, we joined the freshman test and fought together, turning the impossible possible – we emerged as the eventual champions. Now, we are going to fight together again. In fact, it seems like it’s been a long time, hasn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! They hadn’t fought together in their peak condition in a long time. Ever since Huo Yuhao had been critically injured from retrieving the Yearning Heartbroken Grass, and had to sit in a wheelchair,.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed a little and said, “I hope we won’t need to fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they finished speaking, they had already disappeared into the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Huo Yuhao, the Heavenly Sun Douluo and the rest returned, there was another tent beside the White Tiger Duke’s tent. Two nannies were specially deployed to take care of Xu Yunhan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Yunhan had been crying uncontrollably ever since he woke up and discovered that Huo Yuhao wasn’t around. After a while, he couldn’t stand the hunger, and fell asleep after eating something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His adaptability was actually very great. He was barely a year old, and didn’t recognize anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The curtains moved slightly, and two figures arrived outside the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was pitch-black inside the tent right now. Little Yunhan was sleeping very soundly in his cot. The two nannies were sleeping at his side, ready to attend to the little fellow if there was a need to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a gentle smile on his face, but he didn’t make a sound. He walked towards the cot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a long sigh could be heard outside the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, why do you have to do this?” A low-pitched but firm voice echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao acted like he didn’t hear the voice and continued to walk towards the cot. He took Little Yunhan into his embrace. After this, he wrapped him up with a piece of cloth that he had prepared beforehand. With Tang Wutong’s help, he wrapped him up tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he not have expected the White Tiger Duke to guess that he was going to come? However, he still came despite knowing that. This was because he clearly knew that he couldn’t be fooled if little Yunhan wasn’t here, given his Spiritual Detection. He would also be able to find little Yunhan’s detailed location with his Spiritual Detection. This was why the White Tiger Duke didn’t move little Yunhan away. Huo Yuhao also went along with it, which brought him here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gently caressed the little baby’s soft black hair. The gentle look on his face didn’t change, “Little fellow, don’t worry. I’ll protect you until you return to your mother’s side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, he held Tang Wutong’s hand, and the two of them walked out of the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the tent, more than ten figures were scattered in a semi-circle. The White Tiger Duke and Heavenly Sun Douluo were in the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo furrowed his brow, while the White Tiger Duke appeared as conflicted as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a doubt, the Heavenly Sun Douluo was a little disdainful of Huo Yuhao in the beginning, but now, he was very impressed with Huo Yuhao, just like how the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They both knew that Huo Yuhao was going to be the main pillar of Shrek Academy and a man of power in Shrek City in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they could, they didn’t want to offend someone like him and get into his bad books. However, Huo Yuhao was crossing the line by trying to take Xu Yunhan away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Douluo said, “Yuhao, we can take it as if nothing has happened if you leave the Crown Prince now. You can return to Shrek City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and answered, “Since I’m here, there’s not backing out. We can’t use a child as a bargaining chip in this war. We can’t hurt him because of that. This is why I must take him away today. No matter what, I’m leaving with him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s look turned sharper. “How dare you? Do you really think you can escape with so many people here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were filled with resilience and a strong fighting intent, “If I don’t give it a try, how will I know? Even if I fail, at least I tried. If you want the kid back, you’ll need to stop me first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s clothes moved even though there was no wind. “Alright, what an arrogant little man. I really want to see what abilities you possess apart from your detection and concealment abilities. How dare you talk so big?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, the Heavenly Sun Douluo took a step forward. His entire body instantly started to shine. The strong light that came from his body made him seem like a rising sun. He reached forward with his right hand and grabbed towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden hand appeared in the air and approached Huo Yuhao. The surrounding air distorted tremendously, and the temperature rose quickly. However, the weird thing was that the temperature only rose around Huo Yuhao. Nothing changed elsewhere. With his control of his soul power, this Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo was indeed very powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took a step forward with his left foot. He placed his left palm in front of his chest and slowly pushed it forward. He wasn’t quick, but the expressions of all the Titled Douluo changed when they saw him doing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because all of them could sense that an ice mountain seemed to shift as Huo Yuhao pushed his palm forward. The immense aura that was released didn’t seem to be weaker than that of the Heavenly Sun Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind Huo Yuhao, a beam of jade-green light also started to shine. It was a ravishing beauty that was exuding a jade-green glow from her body. She was icy-cold as she stared at the Heavenly Sun Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heat in the air was completely suppressed after she appeared. Even the light from the Heavenly Sun Douluo’s hand became much dimmer because of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chi——”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t move a single inch, but the hand that the Heavenly Sun Douluo formed was crushed in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A slightly red look appeared on Huo Yuhao’s face, but it soon disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo was the most astonished by what he saw. He had thought that he already regarded Huo Yuhao very highly. However, it was only after seeing that that he realized he had underestimated Huo Yuhao. Even though he hadn’t unleashed his full power yet, Huo Yuhao was still able to directly resist his attack. What did this mean? It meant that Huo Yuhao was strong enough to resist him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that every single rank from a Transcendent Douluo on represented vastly different levels of abilities. To be able to resist the Heavenly Sun Douluo’s attack, Huo Yuhao had to at least possess the fighting strength of a Rank 95 Transcendent Douluo. None of the Titled Douluo around were able to do that!</span></p>
