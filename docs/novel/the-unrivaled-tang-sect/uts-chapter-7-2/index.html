 <p><strong>Book 1: Skydream Iceworm</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 7.2: Freshmen Entering the Academy</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had already planned his time out well. Every day, he’d cultivate the Purple Demon Eyes in the morning, then spend two hours practicing the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, Ghost Shadow Perplexing Tracks, and the Mysterious Jade Hands, as well as some grappling techniques. As for the rest of his time, other than the time he spent eating, he’d use all of it to cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique.</p>
 <p>Soulforce was the foundation of a soul master. Currently, he had to use as much of his as he could to cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique.</p>
 <p>“Oh, this technique isn’t bad at all. It’s indeed quite suitable for your current state. You humans are really skilled!” When Huo Yuhao had just entered his cultivation state, everything he saw suddenly turned white. The voice of the Skydream Iceworm also echoed out; he’d been brought back to his spiritual sea.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was slightly surprised as he called out, “Brother Skydream?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm’s lazy voice echoed out, “Your body’s condition has changed a lot during the past few days. You’ve finally gotten a good start. Your body’s endurance has also been gradually increasing. Not bad, not bad. The abilities that you’re cultivating are suitable for you, especially this meditation technique, and that eye training technique. The four soul skills I’ve given you have indeed received benefits from them. You must practice using these soul skills constantly, especially the last one. It should be very effective when combined with your eye training technique. You’ve obtained a basic soul-attack skill. All in all, your condition, as of now, is slightly better than I had predicted.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Skydream, I’ll definitely put a lot of effort into cultivating.” After hearing the Skydream Iceworm’s voice, Huo Yuhao reaffirmed that he’d truly merged with a million-year soul beast, and that he hadn’t been dreaming.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm then said, “I’m tired, thus I need to rest for a period of time. You should just follow your current cultivation method. When you break through, and you need a second soul ring, I’ll naturally wake up. At that time, the ice-type martial soul that I bestowed you with should be able to become a full-fledged martial soul. It’ll cause your strength to have a qualitative leap.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao replied, “How can I find you if I need to?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm said, “If you encounter any danger that you’re unable to escape, I’ll naturally help you out. Don’t worry, I can only live while you’re still alive! Alright, I’m going to sleep…”</p>
 <p>The white light vanished, and Huo Yuhao woke up from his meditation. To his astonishment, he found that the sky outside had already turned completely dark. He’d actually cultivated for six hours... at the very least. The Mysterious Heaven Technique in his body also seemed to have had a slight improvement.</p>
 <p><em>It’s already become night time, but I’m a bit hungry. However, looking at the time, the dining halls should’ve already closed.</em> Fortunately, there were still a few more dry rations within his cloth sack. Thus, after drinking some water and allaying his hunger, Huo Yuhao continued to cultivate.</p>
 <p>After absorbing some of the mystical energy from the eastern purple qi at dawn, Huo Yuhao returned to his room to start cultivating a few of the Tang Sect’s techniques. His attainments in these techniques could be said to only be superficial. Furthermore, he didn’t dedicate most of his energy to this; he was just doing some light cultivation.</p>
 <p>By the time he’d finished his training session, the sky outside had already turned bright. After cleaning himself up, Huo Yuhao walked over to the dining hall for some food. Once he reached the dining hall, he was somewhat concerned. Ever since he’d started cultivating the Mysterious Heaven Technique, his appetite had been rising constantly. Strengthening one’s physique required sufficient nutrients, yet he had no money. His school fees had already been paid for by his eldest senior brother, how could he ask Bei Bei for more?</p>
 <p>Fortunately, there weren’t many varieties of food available for breakfast. Furthermore, breakfast was also cheap. Huo Yuhao bought a few eggs and a bowl of porridge, causing him to reluctantly spend three copper coins. He’d finally replenished his body’s nutrients. Yesterday, he’d even had the thought that the food here was cheap. However, he suddenly discovered that the price of food within Shrek Academy was actually more expensive than the food outside.</p>
 <p>“Junior brother, you can’t be stingy while eating; you can’t lack nutrients. The school has some jobs that are within your abilities to do. You can do these jobs for your livelihood income.” Unbeknownst to him, Bei Bei had arrived at Huo Yuhao’s side.</p>
 <p>“Eldest senior brother!” Huo Yuhao let out a cry of surprise. Up till now, the only people that he was able to recognise within Shrek Academy were Tang Ya and Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei was slightly apologetic as he said, “The reason why I haven’t given you any money directly is because I hope that you can learn to rely on yourself. Combat strength is only a part of one’s strength; a person’s composite strength is determined by many different abilities. Of them, the most important ability is their ability to live under any circumstances. Do you understand?”</p>
 <p>“Eldest senior brother, you’ve already given me a lot of help. I understand. I still have a few silver coins as of right now, so I’ll go take up some jobs after school opens.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei rubbed his head. “I’ll go first. You must remember this: money can be earned, but you can’t be stingy with your food. You must have your nutrition.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao followed Bei Bei as they walked out of the dining hall together. He decided to listen to his eldest senior brother’s advice; he’d treat himself to a meal today.</p>
 <p>When he returned to his dorm room, Huo Yuhao was surprised to discover that the door to his room was open. He felt astonished at first, before realizing the fact that his roommate might have arrived.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a youth walked out of the room. After seeing Huo Yuhao, he was also stunned.</p>
 <p>The youth had a delicate appearance, as well as fair skin. His large eyes were very unusual; they were actually a faint pinkish-blue. His settled short hair was also the same colour. His appearance seemed to be even more handsome than Bei Bei’s. This was truly the most handsome person that Huo Yuhao had ever seen. His height and age didn’t seem to be that different from Huo Yuhao’s either.</p>
 <p>“You are?” Huo Yuhao asked subconsciously.</p>
 <p>The youth was somewhat haughty as he stared at him. “Step aside.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Huo Yuhao hurriedly stepped to the side. The youth walked past him, then stopped after taking a few steps out of the room. He turned around to look at Huo Yuhao as he said, “You also live in this dorm room, I assume. Since you’ve cleaned this room up so well, I’ll allow you to live with me for now. I have a few rules that you must remember: One, you’re not allowed to randomly bring other people back to this room. Two, you’re not allowed to bare your disgusting naked body in this room. Three, you’re not allowed to snore at night. Four, you’re not allowed to bother me. Five, you’re in charge of the cleanliness of this room in the future, but you can’t touch my bed. Do you understand clearly?”</p>
 <p>When he saw the youth’s arrogant appearance, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but let his anger hit the roof. “Why must I listen to you?”</p>
 <p>The youth snorted coldly. “If you don’t listen to me, I’ll simply throw you out. If you don’t believe me, you’re welcome to try.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had been bullied by people from the Duke’s Mansion since he was young, so the people that he hated the most were these types of arrogant people. He coldly said, “If you want fight, then let’s fight. Let’s go outside.”</p>
 <p>As he looked at Huo Yuhao’s unsubmissive appearance, the youth actually laughed. His smile was very good-looking, but the disdain and contempt in it ignited the anger in Huo Yuhao’s heart even more.</p>
 <p>“I still don’t know your name.” The youth said with disdain.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao spoke in a low tone, “Before asking someone elses name, shouldn’t you tell me your name first?”</p>
 <p>The youth indifferently said, “I’m Wang Dong.”</p>
 <p>“I’m Huo Yuhao.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong smiled as he suddenly approached Huo Yuhao. “Very good. I think that your name shall quickly disappear from Shrek Academy. Let’s go, idiot.” As he said this, he took the initiative to turn around and walk out of the room.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s fists were tightly clenched as he followed Wang Dong with large strides. Even though he knew that his combat strength wasn’t that high, he would never allow anyone to bully him again. Furthermore, this person would even be his roommate for at least a year.</p>
