Elder Xuan was going all-out to protect the three of them. The tragedy that had occurred before served as a warning to him. He had the strength to follow the three of them, but his power was beneath the ground. That’s why Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection couldn’t detect him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was also stunned when discovered the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat. This Deviltiger Cat’s cultivation was nothing to him, but it was able to kill Huo Yuhao and the other two, who were only around Rank 30 on average.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Elder Xuan wouldn’t make his move so easily, having taught in Shrek Academy for years. He wanted to see how the three of them would react when their lives were in danger. He didn’t want them to be complacent just because they had protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them had displayed astonishing strength. Elder Xuan only expected the three of them to resist the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat’s assault for some time. But who knew that they would take the Deviltiger Cat down successfully, and even capture it alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan hadn’t expected such an ending. It was also his first time realizing that the three of them couldn’t be judged based on their current cultivation. Even Elder Xuan was slightly shocked by the aura of desolation when Huo Yuhao used the Ice Empress’ Wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One makes the greatest improvement in a life and death situation. The three of them are good. I shall let them experience what the laws of the jungle are in this Star Dou Forest. Their luck seems to be really good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Elder Xuan muttered to himself, a ball of yellow light started to rise from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s soul power was restored faster and faster. From their depleted state, it only took 15 minutes before they reached 50% of their soul power. Huo Yuhao opened his eyes suddenly at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could he not be wary since he was in Star Dou Forest, where soul beasts were everywhere? He had continued to use his Spiritual Detection even though his soul power was greatly depleted. He had only not used the Spiritual Detection Sharing to save his soul power during the process of cultivating with Wang Dong. Only he could sense the changes around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Another soul beast is coming.” His Spiritual Detection Sharing was initiated, and used on Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao’s expressions changed. They were not in their best condition now. They both tensed up as they were given another warning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao signaled, the three of them walked around the ice-sealed ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat to one side. Huo Yuhao lifted his left hand and pressed it against the Deviltiger Cat. An azure light flashed across subtly. Following that, he waved his hand lightly, initiating his Imitation. But he wasn’t imitating the aura of any soul beast, but the aura of plants. A layer of dim green light covered the three of them, and they walked further into the forest under his guidance. They tried not to make any noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul beast that Huo Yuhao had discovered was not as quick as the Deviltiger Cat. Rather, it looked a little sluggish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An huge, entirely pitch-black bear appeared within his Spiritual Detection. Its nose kept on moving, as if it were sniffing something. Huo Yuhao judged that this was a soul beast that was a few thousand years old from its vigorous energy and undulations of soul power, regardless of its species. It wasn’t just an ordinary soul beast; its cultivation was at least three thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge bear had managed to use its acute olfactory sense to sniff out the location of their previous fight. Its attention was first caught by the ice-sealed Deviltiger Cat, before it realized the presence of the thousand year old Deviltiger Cat and went towards it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Detection Sharing to share his thoughts with the other two, “It seems to be attracted by the bloody smell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This huge bear was more than 3 meters in length. It was very burly, and its black fur seemed to emit a slight golden glow. It didn’t seem to be afraid even though it saw the ice-sealed ten thousand year old Deviltiger Cat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the case in the world of soul beasts. While cultivation was important, the species of the soul beast also determined how strong they were. This bear possessed a cultivation between three to five thousand years. But it wasn’t afraid when it faced the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two ten thousand year soul beasts of different species still possessed great differences in their abilities. If it were a ten thousand year tiger-type soul beast that was present here, this huge bear would have absconded. It would have never gotten close to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the bear now devoured the thousand year Deviltiger Cat in 2 to 3 bites, but it wasn’t full yet. It came before the ice-sealed Deviltiger Cat and tried to claw at the ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its power was extremely frightening. Although Huo Yuhao’s cultivation couldn’t allow him to use his Ultimate Ice on the ice-sealed Deviltiger Cat for too long, the frozen ice chunk was still very tough. But the bear managed to claw till cracks appeared on the ice. It’s important to know that the entire ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat was frozen, including its blood. Its body would crack along with the frozen ice chunk if the bear continued to claw at the ice like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned to Xiao Xiao at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was stunned and asked, “What how?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “Is this bear suitable to be your soul ring?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was stunned. “Why would you think of this now? Its cultivation seems to be suitable. But we’ve only sensed it using your Spiritual Detection. We haven’t seen it. We can’t even confirm what soul beast it is. How can we judge whether it’s suitable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled slightly. “I know you plan to supplement the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron with either a defense-type or control-type soul skill. This bear didn’t even flinch when it saw the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat. This means that it’s emotionally stable, and therefore tells me that it isn’t afraid of the Deviltiger Cat. Coupled with the fact that the Deviltiger Cat is offensively threatening, I can conclude that this bear is defensively strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Furthermore, the Deviltiger Cat’s attacks don’t seem to threaten it that much. This bear must come from a species that’s rather strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao opened her eyes wide and said, “Yes! No wonder you’re the class monitor. You can analyze so much even without using your eyes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “My main martial soul is both a spiritual and control-type. Observation and analysis are my strengths. Make a decision now, or it’ll be too late.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao said, “Of course I want it. We can’t let it go! But can we deal with a soul beast that’s unafraid of the Deviltiger Cat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used his actions to answer Xiao Xiao’s doubts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bear managed to get the ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat out after clawing at the ice several times. It lifted the Deviltiger Cat up and was about to smash it onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the Deviltiger Cat suddenly turned azure-green. A reverberating boom resonated across the entire Star Dou Forest following that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A vicious bear roar was heard after this. Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao were a hundred meters away, but they still felt a frightening shockwave coming their way. Many plants and trees were instantly destroyed by this shockwave, while the three of them were sent flying for tens of meters before they landed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was there to warn them earlier. The three of them had made preparations and took advantage of the situation, thus they were not hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t only Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao who were shocked. Even Huo Yuhao was stunned for a moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The frightening shockwave carried some remnants of ice, and the cool feeling caused a chill to travel down everyone’s spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The frightening explosion even caused Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection to be scattered. But they didn’t need to use it anymore. They could just use their sight now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A frightening scene was presented before them. A huge crater had appeared, with the ice-sealed Deviltiger Cat at the center. It covered a radius of more than a hundred meters. All the plants within this area had disappeared, as they were blown to ashes by the explosion.</span></p>

The plants and trees around this depression had also fallen. It seemed as if there was a collapsed plot of wheat.</span></p>

During the top-ranked auction at the Starlight Auctionplace, my Ice Jade Empress Scorpion Let Arm Bone was one of the final auction items. It was only inferior to the hundred thousand year old soul beast embryo. That’s because the Ice Explosion Technique that it contains is considered a divine skill under the appropriate conditions. But it’s useless in certain environments too. Not all ice exploded by this technique will cause such a huge force. Normal ice can be induced to explode by the Ice Explosion Technique, but the explosive force is related to my soul power – it won’t be too strong. The real threat of the Ice Explosion Technique is similar to the corpse explosion we saw when we faced that evil soul master. The stronger the corpse being detonated, the greater the explosive force. But two prerequisites must be fulfilled first. First, the entire body must be frozen, and it must be filled with water internally. Second, I must come into contact with it using my left arm and inject the strength of the Ice Explosion Technique into its body. The body’s own strength will develop a special reaction with the ice under the guidance of the Ice Explosion Technique, and can be induced to explode at any time. The stronger the target, the more frightening the explosive force.”</span></p>
