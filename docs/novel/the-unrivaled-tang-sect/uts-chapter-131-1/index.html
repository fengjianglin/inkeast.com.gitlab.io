 <p>Wang Dong rushed to speak first, “Let me go first.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu suddenly said, “Why don’t the both of you write your paths on my hand at the same time?” As he spoke, he smiled while extending both his hands.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu’s hands appeared extremely youthful, unlike his face. His palms were slender, and his skin was clear like jade. A sparkling radiance subtly flashed, but it was different from Wang Dong’s glossy skin. There was a sense of simplicity to his palms.</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong stared at each other. They acted with great chemistry, and came to Elder Mu’s side.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu smiled and said, “You can begin.”</p> 
 <p>They lifted their hands and extended their index fingers at the same time. They wrote the paths that belonged to them on his palms. These were the paths that they would walk for their entire lives.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu’s smile widened. He clenched his palms into fists when they both stopped.</p> 
 <p>“The two of you have indeed found the paths that belong to you. Very good. I’m very comforted.” As he spoke, he lifted his hands, and they intersected. His palms faced towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p> 
 <p>There were two words on both his palms, and they shone with a dim golden color.</p> 
 <p>“Tang Sect.”</p> 
 <p>“Tang Sect!”</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong exclaimed together. They were shocked as they looked at each other. They were momentarily stunned.</p> 
 <p>Was this chemistry? It couldn’t be simply described using chemistry anymore. The paths they chose were exactly the same.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu smiled and said, “Wang Dong, tell me first why you chose this path. What does it mean to you?”</p> 
 <p>Wang Dong replied, “I’m actually not very sure myself. Both my martial souls are assault-type. Without a doubt, my path should be assault-based. But during the process of deep meditation, the words ‘Tang Sect’ popped up for no reason. I also realized that my strength is closely related to the different capabilities of the Tang Sect. Besides being unskilled in secret weapons, the rest of the Tang Sect’s methods are aligned with my skills. They include the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, Purple Demon Eyes, Mysterious Jade Hands, Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, etc. Both the Radiant Butterfly Goddess and Clear Sky Hammer require offensive tactics. The most accurate soul master just unleashes his soul power, whereas a stronger soul master unleashes his soul power cleverly. I hope to become a soul master that combines my soul skills with the Tang Sect’s techniques. This is the path that I want to take.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu nodded his head and said, “Very good. Huo Yuhao, what about you?”</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao looked at Wang Dong and said, “My situation is more complex than Wang Dong’s. But I think that the Tang Sect is more suitable for me.”</p> 
 <p>“I have two martial souls. One is a control-type, and the other is an assault-type. While I can use both of them at the same time, their effects are unleashed on their own. It’s extremely crucial for my future cultivation to organically combine both my martial souls. At the same time, I’m not just a soul master, but also a soul engineer. If I only cultivate my martial soul, I will only be a pure soul master. But I don’t wish for it to be so. I’m unwilling to give up my soul tools. That’s why I thought of the Tang Sect.”</p> 
 <p>“I’ve learnt all of Tang Sect’s Six Great Secret Techniques – the Purple Demon Eyes, Mysterious Jade Hands, Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon, Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, Hidden Weapon Hundred Separation and Mysterious Heaven Technique. I’m more skilled in the Mysterious Heaven Technique and Purple Demon Eyes among these six techniques. I only have brief experience with the other four techniques.”</p> 
 <p>“But when I thought of the Tang Sect, I found to my surprise that all of my capabilities can be related to the Tang Sect. My Spirit Eyes are greatly connected to the Purple Demon Eyes. I only managed to possess a spiritual-type ability like the Spiritual Shock because of the Purple Demon Eyes. My Spirit Eyes’ attainments in the aspect of spiritual control can also help me to use many of the Tang Sect’s secret techniques. This includes the Tang Sect’s secret weapons. And that’s not even mentioning the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. An ice-type soul skill combined effectively with the Tang Sect’s capturing techniques and footwork. Just like Wang Dong said, it’ll increase my abilities greatly.”</p> 
 <p>“When I first studied secret weapons in the Tang Sect, eldest senior told me that the only way to rebuild the glory of the sect was by combining soul tools and secret weapons. I’m more and more inclined to believe that this will work. That’s why my future path will combine the Tang Sect’s secret techniques with my own capabilities. This is my choice.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu nodded repeatedly as he heard Huo Yuhao’s words. “Very good. The two of you have made good choices. The Tang Sect’s secret techniques once prospered under Tang San, the founder of the Tang Sect. Tang San managed to save the world of soul masters using the Tang Sect’s Six Great Secret Techniques and break through the bottleneck, achieving rapid progress. The collapse of the Tang Sect doesn’t equate to the collapse of the Tang Sect’s secret techniques. It’s just that no one suitable has been able to master the Tang Sect’s secret techniques. Both of you have extraordinary talents. I hope that you can continue to walk this path and complete it. You shall inherit the Tang Sect’s ancestors’ immense strength and write your own legends.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu turned his wrists around, and something else appeared in both his palms.</p> 
 <p>In front of Huo Yuhao was the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s left arm bone that he had once seen at the top-ranked auction in the Starlight Auction house. A thick, icy fog caused the temperature in the hall to dip quickly.</p> 
 <p>There was a right arm bone in Elder Mu’s other hand. This right arm bone presented itself in bright gold, and the radiance that came from it carried an intense aura of sharpness.</p> 
 <p>“Yuhao, I’ve analyzed this left arm bone before. It’s a soul bone that came from at least a ten thousand year soul beast. Although soul bone absorption won’t be as tremendous as a soul ring’s reaction, the Ultimate Ice aura contained within this soul bone is extremely domineering. I believe the saying about the Ice Explosion Technique is real. Are you confident?”</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up, and he nodded his head with strength.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu smiled and passed him the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone. He said, “Then you can start fusing it here.”</p> 
 <p>“Wang Dong, this right arm bone is called the Broken Devil of Light. I obtained it when I was young, but it’s a pity that I already had six soul bones then. Otherwise, you’d have had no fate with it. This Broken Devil of Light came from an extremely rare element-type soul beast. This strong presence can only be nurtured in a place where the light element is in abundance. I’m still not sure what soul skill the Broken Devil of Light carries, and I can only tell when it combines with you. But I’m certain that it carries a powerful offensive soul skill. It also has a strong restraining effect on all dark and evil powers. I believe evil soul masters will be afraid when they see it.”</p> 
 <p>“When soul bones are being paired, it’s best to pair the corresponding soul bone to an existing soul bone that you possess. Since you already have the Golden Light Left Arm Bone, the addition of this Broken Devil of Light will greatly enhance all your soul skills. You can also start fusing it here. I shall protect the both of you.”</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were both surprised, especially Huo Yuhao. After Elder Mu exposed his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, he was still anxious, although he had completed his deep meditation. But Elder Mu had passed the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone to him now, which made him more assured and enabled him to understand that Elder Mu’s words were true; that the academy wasn’t bothered about the origin of his second martial soul.</p> 
 <p>Both of them received their respective soul bones and sat cross-legged on the ground to either side of Elder Mu.</p> 
 <p>Wang Dong gently caressed the Broken Devil of Light’s smooth surface. At the same time, his left arm also lit up with an intense, golden flame. The golden light seeped into the Broken Devil of Light slowly, and caused the right arm bone to light up with the same light too. An intense aura of light caused Wang Dong’s body to become transparent again. The Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings flapped open behind his back before stretching forward to cover his entire body. Bright, golden halos started to spread from his body.</p> 
 <p>This soul bone that Elder Mu gave him was the academy’s treasure, and not a reward from the tournament. Since the soul bone was personally picked out by Elder Mu, it was guaranteed to be compatible.</p> 
 <p>Amidst the undulation of the light aura, the Broken Devil of Light started to fuse with Wang Dong’s right arm. Wang Dong only felt a patch of warmth on his right arm, and didn’t experience any pain.</p> 
 <p>It was easy for Wang Dong to absorb this Broken Devil of Light with the golden light in front of him because the Radiant Butterfly Goddess was once baptized by the golden tree’s aura of light. But he was still inferior to Huo Yuhao in terms of compatibility.</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt an indescribable sense of closeness that came from the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone when it entered his hand.</p> 
 <p>If this soul bone had appeared in front of other soul masters, they would immediately be affected by the ultimate chill released by the soul bone. Even Elder Mu had to use his own power of light to suppress it.</p> 
 <p>But Huo Yuhao only felt a sense of closeness. To him, there was no sense of chill to speak of.</p> 
 <p>An azure light lit up Huo Yuhao’s chest and back. The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton seemed to have been awakened by this left arm bone. The aura of a ruler that belonged to the Ice Jade Scorpions was gradually exuded, while the left arm bone in Huo Yuhao’s hands seemed to come alive. It trembled slightly, then leapt up like a child that had seen his mother. It turned into a streak of white light before penetrating Huo Yuhao’s left arm.</p>
