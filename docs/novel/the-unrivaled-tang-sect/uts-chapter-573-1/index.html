 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second strongest person in Shrek Academy! Even though he was only the second strongest, it was still equally shocking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Shrek Academy was not just any institution. Even the Sun Moon Empire had to admit that it was not one of the strongest academies, but the strongest academy in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Holy Ghost Church had been building up reserves of power for thousands of years, they still did not dare to use the evil soul masters they had nurtured to launch an attack on Shrek Academy. They did not dare to challenge Shrek Academy even though they had two Ultimate Douluo. And that was because of the huge amount of reserves it had built up over tens of thousands of years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when the soul beasts launched the beast wave against Shrek City, they were ultimately still unable to destroy Shrek City even though they had five of the Ten Great Savage Beasts among them. This showed exactly how powerful Shrek Academy was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could only imagine how powerful their second strongest cultivator was. On top of that, this person was rumored to be the founder of the Spirit Pagoda. This piece of information further shocked everyone from the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was not particularly pleased with his third senior brother’s introduction of him. However, he knew he should not make him look bad in front of the Dou Ling Empire. Hence, he stepped forward and stood beside Xu Sanshi as he nodded towards the people whom Xu Sanshi was addressing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the higher-ups from the Dou Ling Empire saw how Huo Yuhao was even younger than Xu Sanshi, they seemed to be mildly amused..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi immediately clarified, “I will urge everyone not to doubt his abilities just because of his tender age. He is, in fact, a talent which is only produced once in a thousand years from our Academy. He currently already possesses the ability of a Transcendent Douluo, and also has twin martial souls. Just now, he personally went after the two Sun Moon Empire soul engineer legions which attacked us, and has already confirmed their identities. They were the two beast-ranked soul engineer legions—the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion and the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion. Yuhao and his beloved pursued the legions, and destroyed more than half of their soul engineers. On top of that, they were able to kill the legion commander of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion. If they were not concerned about the situation at Dou Ling City, they would probably have killed every single enemy who had attacked our city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi’s words were indeed a little exaggerated. He had merely said what he understood and guessed. Little did he know that his guesses were actually spot-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old prime minister’s jaw dropped as he looked at Huo Yuhao. “Are you really the pagoda master of the Spirit Pagoda?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded gently and said, “Yes, I am. I know it’s a little hard to believe it because of my age. In that case, let me try to provide some evidence to support these claims.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao strode forward. At the next instant, an immensely powerful aura exploded from his body as his soul rings started to gradually rise from his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone saw how his first soul ring was white, they could not help but frown.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Isn’t a white soul ring a ten-year soul ring?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they soon noticed how the white soul ring was radiating a brilliant golden color. Following which, black rings started to rise from his feet. When it reached the sixth soul ring, they saw a rose gold soul ring. Afterward, the remaining soul rings were all red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant that the colors of Huo Yuhao’s nine soul rings were gold, black, black, black, black, rose gold, red, red, and red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of soul ring collection is this?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was not going to be the last thing which would startle them. Huo Yuhao squinted as he released his invincible spiritual power and enveloped the entire ruins of the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone could sense a gentle stream of spiritual power flowing into his or her spiritual sea. Following which, they could see more than half of Dou Ling City from their spiritual seas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not only seeing the silhouette, but every single detail of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that there were close to a thousand people present before them! How much spiritual power did it require to share these images with so many people?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes only had eight soul rings. His Ultimate Ice martial soul was the one with nine soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao had used his Imitation to make some slight adjustments to his abilities to leave a deeper impression on the crowd. After all, his spiritual power was already on par with that of an Ultimate Douluo. It did not matter whether he was short a single soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very clear about what he had to do right now. He needed to help his third senior brother stabilize the current situation. If possible, he wanted to help his third senior brother become Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dou Ling Empire needed stability more than anything right now. It was only possible to quell their fears by demonstrating strong power. This would then convince them to acknowledge his third senior brother’s status and identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This also happened to be the first time Huo Yuhao had tried to perform Spiritual Detection Sharing on a few thousand people. It was not as simple as what he did when he was leading the soul engineer legion. He did not have to project the details of close to half a city to more than a thousand people back then!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two soul cores within Huo Yuhao were rotating furiously as they tried to replenish the spiritual power he was expending. Even though his current Spiritual Detection Sharing was consuming a lot of spiritual power, he was definitely able to maintain it for an extended period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a couple of minutes, Huo Yuhao ended his Spiritual Detection Sharing and returned to Xu Sanshi’s side. He said, “I believe everyone present was able to see the current situation of Dou Ling City. To be honest, the entire incident was very tragic. We had, in fact, already reached the Dou Ling Empire before the attack after receiving news that the Sun Moon Empire would definitely attack the Dou Ling Empire. However, we did not know where the enemy was, or how they would try to attack you. Hence, we focused our efforts on the borders, and wasted too much time there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who would have known that the Sun Moon Empire would try to sneak in and head straight to Dou Ling City without anyone knowing? By the time we discovered what they were trying to do, it was already too late. We could not stop the tragedy from unfolding in time. Regardless of whether it is my third senior brother or my other peers from the Shrek Academy, we only have one objective, and that is to help the Dou Ling Empire. We are not here to wrest away any political power. I hope all of you can believe that we come in peace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s words made the Dou Ling Empire’s military staff blush in embarrassment. His words meant that the entire Dou Ling Empire’s security troops were not even aware that the Sun Moon Empire’s two soul engineer legions had managed to sneak past the security at the borders and move towards the capital. If they wanted to push the blame on someone, the military staff and generals present should all have been put to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, a heavy silence fell upon the crowd. The strength Huo Yuhao had demonstrated had already convinced everyone of his power. His feat of using his own spiritual power to share the entire situation of the Dou Ling City with all of them was truly unheard of!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi’s identity was more or less confirmed. At most, they would send some people over to Shrek Academy to verify it one last time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So what was going to happen next?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The prime minister walked towards Xu Sanshi before kneeling on the ground with one knee. “Your Highness, the Dou Ling Empire is currently in an extremely precarious predicament. Now that we have verified your identity, can I get Your Highness to lead us and rebuild the palace? In addition, I hope that Your Highness can temporarily take over His Majesty’s position to provide some much-needed reassurance to our people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi nodded gently. He no longer had any reservations at this point. Usually, he would never have chosen to stay here to become a Prince, or take on any kind of high-level administrative position. However, now that the Dou Ling Empire was on the verge of crumbling, he had no choice, especially when his mother was the Princess of this empire. He could not allow the Dou Ling Empire to fall before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There would be a huge political problem within the Dou Ling Empire if the royal family had no descendants to take the throne. The entire empire would become fragmented as everyone would try to seize political power and set up their own government. And when that happened, the empire would collapse by itself. How would the Star Luo Empire then protect itself against the Sun Moon Empire without support from the Dou Ling Empire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, it was undeniable that the Sun Moon Empire’s mission had been very successful. If not for Xu Sanshi’s unexpected appearance, it would still have been very successful even if the two beast lord-leveled soul engineer legions were all killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed in despair. Right now, the only thing he could do was support Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding ministers and staff started to kneel down before Xu Sanshi after the prime minister and Commander Li had done so. All of them started to pay their respects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the looks of the current situation, Xu Sanshi was definitely the aptest successor to the throne. It was most important for the Dou Ling Empire to stabilize the hearts of its people and its military.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi got both the prime minister and Commander Li to stay behind as the three of them held an emergency meeting to make three important decisions. The first decision was to make sure that news of the attack on the palace was kept secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second decision was that Xu Sanshi would continue to chair the court meetings as the prince regent, since he was the only possible successor from the royal family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third decision was to prioritize providing reassurance to the people within Dou Ling City. After all, they could not afford to lose the confidence of their people. They would announce to the citizens that the palace did not sustain heavy losses, and that the majority of the royal family was only hurt. Only a few of them were dead because of the explosion. The prince regent would take over the duty of ruling the empire only because His Majesty was currently injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would definitely not allow the elite troops at Shrek City to hear of this news. The worst thing that could happen to the Dou Ling Empire was chaos! It would be a huge tragedy if their army at the front line were to mutiny. It would also be terrible if the people in their empire started to lose confidence in the royal family and decided to overthrow them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, it was not the right time to get the elite troops to return. It was vital for them to stabilize the capital before discussing what their next move should be.</span></p>
