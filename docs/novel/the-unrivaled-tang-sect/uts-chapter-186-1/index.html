 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Huo Yuhao couldn’t take it anymore, and thus he decided to hide from them. After all, they couldn’t possibly spar inside Illustrious Virtue Hall. As a result, Huo Yuhao often remained in Illustrious Virtue Hall until late at night before returning to his dorm room, avoiding trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were still some of the few friends that Huo Yuhao had at the academy. Of course, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t admit to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan and Ji Juechen were also very picky. He Caitou did tell them that he wanted to team up with Huo Yuhao to fight them, but they wouldn’t accept it. They were only interested in sparring with Huo Yuhao, who was skilled in close-combat and possessed the Sovereign’s Descent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou shook his head at Huo Yuhao and said, “Of course it isn’t the two of them. How are they surprises? They’re more of a shock. Guys, we’ve things to deal with today. He can’t entertain you.” As he spoke, he quickly dragged Huo Yuhao away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t wait to get away from them. He followed He Caitou willingly this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Jing Ziyan shifted and grinned as she blocked them. Ji Juechen was even more ruthless. He brandished his Extraterrestrial Meteoric Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan smiled as she said, “It’s fate that we meet. Yuhao, we haven’t looked for you in days. Since we’ve met, let’s spar. I’ve recently gained some enlightenment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s facial muscles twitched a little, and he said, “I seemed to have fought the both of you two days ago. You call that days? Can’t you give me some breathing space? I concede defeat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen pointed his sword at Huo Yuhao and said, “Defeat me. Then I’ll give you breathing space.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Huo Yuhao glared. “Ji Juechen, do you really think I’m scared of you? Don’t make me beat you until you’re half-dead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan chortled, “It’s okay. I’ll take care of him. Don’t give me face. You can whack him first. If you’ve sufficient energy after that, you can also whack me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou rolled his eyes and wanted to pull Huo Yuhao away. He said, “Little junior, you’re really stupid! If we can’t deal with them, why don’t we just run away!? Let’s go.” As he spoke, he grabbed Huo Yuhao’s waist and lifted him up. He made a half turn, and his thick arms flung Huo Yuhao into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had great chemistry. Huo Yuhao flipped in mid-air and initiated his soul thrusters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blinding light shone from his back before the two of them burst towards the academy’s gate. At this point, he ignored the academy’s rule that no soul tools could be used in non-experimentation areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen and Jing Ziyan didn’t expect He Caitou to do this, and thus they were slow to react. However, they weren’t ones to give up. They quickly chased after them. Both of them were Soul Emperors, and they teamed up well with each other too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen didn’t have a soul thruster. However, that was fine, since Jing Ziyan had one!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan quickly climbed onto his back, and her Class 6 soul thruster was immediately activated. The sudden thrusting force propelled both of them towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen had made significant improvements over the past half year too. He was still able to hold onto his sword with both hands, even under such a circumstance. He unleashed his swift and vicious sword intent. Evidently, they didn’t really care about the school rules, either!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao fled. While he used Class 5 soul thrusters, there were several of them! The four Class 5 soul thrusters on his back could change direction based on the control of his intent and muscles. Not only were they very explosive, but they were also very adaptable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was almost out of the gate. At such a high speed, even the guards at the academy’s gate couldn’t stop him, and could only watch as he escaped out the gate. However, the academy’s alarm rang soon after that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little lost after he exited the gate. That was because he didn’t know where to go. So what if he fled? At this speed, it was arduous for him to continue escaping! Furthermore, it was easier to spar than flee! He Caitou had evidently come up with a bad idea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they burst out of the gate, Jing Ziyan and Ji Juechen also followed suit. Just as Huo Yuhao decreased his speed and was ready to turn back, a crisp voice that carried a sense of furious and vicious killing intent rose up. “Who dares to hurt him?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ball of intense golden light mixed with a dazzling blue blew apart like fireworks. It instantly changed into countless streaks of light that penetrated through the air, forcefully blocking Jing Ziyan and Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen’s sword intent was initially targeted towards Huo Yuhao. However, he displayed his strength as he came under attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His vicious sword intent soared, and a streak of black sword light was unleashed. The further this sword light flew, the bigger it grew. There was even a subtle draconic roar coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the streaks of golden light met the immense sword intent, they were swept away. However, a strange scene appeared. The golden lights that were brushed aside didn’t disperse, but stuck onto the Extraterrestrial Meteoric Sword. After Ji Juechen’s sword managed to sweep all the blades away, a bluish-gold ball of light a foot wide was already attached to the back of it. Following that, a tremendous boom rang out as an aura of light was released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen and Jing Ziyan were sent flying as the wave of gold struck them. The intense aura of light spread, and the shockwave threw them off-balance as they were struck. Naturally, they stopped their pursuit of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where was Huo Yuhao now? He seemed to have been struck by a soul skill that turned him to stone. He stood there completely motionless, and his Spirit Eyes were fixed in a certain direction… the direction the golden lights came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dazzling bluish-gold light shone in the air, looking even more dazzling in the sunlight. A figure with medium-long, pinkish-blue hair that flowed past his shoulders and a charming appearance was standing there. Although only his side profile could be seen, Huo Yuhao could sense his aloofness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pair of blue wings flapped open behind his face. A halo that flashed with a complementary golden light pattern subtly appeared above the wings. It was like a small sun that bore down on the wings. One yellow, two purple, and two black soul rings shone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen had another nickname in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. His first nickname was “Handsome Man”. However, he was too cold as a person, and hardly smiled at anyone or anything. The female students in the academy always nagged him for wasting his looks. However, this person that had surfaced was definitely not inferior to Ji Juechen in terms of his appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was equally as handsome, but possessed a different aura. This slender youth was not as cold than Ji Juechen, as he carried a slight sense of gentility. His skin was also slightly whiter and smoother, the look in his eyes more vibrant. It didn’t possess the sharpness that Ji Juechen had, but there was a sense of elegance there instead. Compared to Ji Juechen, his looks were better able to attract the attention of girls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan wasn’t one to care about handsome guys, but she was astonished by how handsome he was. Ji Juechen squinted his eyes because of the light and aura that other party exuded. His sword intent also became more intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He possessed a pair of wings with golden stripes, and had such a charming face. He even helped Huo Yuhao block off Jing Ziyan and Ji Juechen’s pursuit. Yes, he was the surprise that He Caitou had mentioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wang Dong.” Huo Yuhao finally recovered from his daze. He was confused, and his eyes even turned blurry from the tears that had suddenly surfaced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He increased his speed without using his soul thrusters and burst forward. He leapt forward and hugged this brother of his that had travelled so far to visit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was also emotional as he was hugged by Huo Yuhao from the side. However, he kept his cool. “Huo Yuhao, let’s deal with the enemy first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Enemy?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao was momentarily dazed. He twisted his head to look at the wary Ji Juechen and Jing Ziyan. A teasing look also appeared on his face. Since he was always annoyed by the two of them, he was going to teach them a good lesson today.</span></p>

Today, your opportunity is here. This is my brother, his name is Wang Dong. Let’s fight two-on-two here. We won’t use any soul tools. Are you up for it?”</span></p>

He’s also from Shrek, right? Very well, let’s fight for the glory of our academies.”</span></p>

Perhaps it was because he had met someone that could rival him in terms of looks, but he stared at Wang Dong with a burning look in his eyes. As he lifted his Extraterrestrial Meteoric Sword, his sword intent soared, and he shouted in a deep voice, “Come on!”</span></p>

The rarity of his cultivation method – giving up soul skills and honing his fighting skills – was comparable to twin martial souls. However, that was also because he used all his soul skills to enhance his soul power like a soul engineer, which was used to complement his fighting skills.</span></p>

However, he was definitely at a disadvantage in a real fight due to the gap in their soul powers.</span></p>
