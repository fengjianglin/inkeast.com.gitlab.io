 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blinding red light erupted from the cannon and blasted toward the two soul engineer legions in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a normal bursting cannon, and its effects were very simple. It could produce an intense explosive force and high temperatures to cause destructiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had crafted this bursting cannon by himself. It was a Class 7 soul tool, but its offensive power was only about that of a Class 5 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a big difference between a Class 7 soul tool and a Class 5 soul tool. Since its offensive capability was only that of a Class 5 soul tool, then why was the soul tool itself Class 7? The reason was simple: because Huo Yuhao had tried to maximize other aspects. In this case, it was the cannon’s range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s bursting cannon could achieve a range of ten kilometers, which was ten thousand meters. That could already rival certain stationary soul cannon shells. Even Xuan Ziwen had praised him when he crafted this Class 7 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was very strict and demanding, and he typically didn’t praise his students unless they had made some extraordinary achievements. Huo Yuhao was undoubtedly the person who had received the most compliments from Xuan Ziwen, but even then, those instances were few and far between.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soul cannon that wasn’t a stationary soul tool that could fire at such an extraordinary range was something very rarely seen in the history of soul engineers. Even Xuan Ziwen himself probably couldn’t do it better than Huo Yuhao if he had done it himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a reason why Huo Yuhao had crafted this soul cannon, and his goal was simple. He wanted to be able to bait his enemies when necessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Stationary soul cannon shells were too expensive, and they were also single-use items. Even though Huo Yuhao had expended many rare metals when crafting this soul cannon, and those rare metals were also considered the extremely precious kinds, he could use this soul cannon again and again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had fired his cannon, and the cannon shell accelerated through the air. The cannon shell was streamlined, and it was like a date seed as it went straight for the Sun Moon Empire’s two soul engineer legions in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This shell’s velocity as it left the barrel wasn’t considered quick, but what was frightening was its acceleration afterward. The shell immediately sped up after flying for a hundred meters, and the shell itself split as part of the original shell propelled it forward, so that the other half could continue blasting forward at an incredible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was accomplished in an energy state! It wasn’t hard to see how extraordinary this was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” An explosion accompanied an orange-red spark as the shell detonated on the soul engineer legions’ defensive barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had ambushed the two legions before this in the beginning, those soul engineers who had survived didn’t really know what had happened. After Huo Yuhao’s sudden attack that almost killed Xia Xuanchen, and in addition to their sharp decline in numbers, they would be fools if they didn’t know what was happening under such circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, these soul engineers were extremely tense even as they maintained their linked defensive barrier while flying forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the single soul cannon shell exploded on their defensive barrier, almost every soul engineer’s first reaction was to raise their linked defense barrier to its highest possible level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evil Tyrant Legion wasn’t the only one; even the Imperial Dragon Legion behaved in the same fashion. Two soul engineer legions’ linked defensive barriers instantly took shape, and they even began charging their linked offensive soul tools so that they could be prepared to attack at any moment. Their reactions were stunningly quick, all extremely correct and precise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianyuan and Xia Xuanchen, as those legions’ commanders, couldn’t find any problems with their responses at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But a problem did appear. This problem was both simple and direct: where was the enemy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single soul cannon was fired, but they couldn’t find any traces of their enemy at all. Furthermore, that attack was just a simple soul cannon strike that didn’t do anything to them at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire had almost rendered bursting cannons obsolete, because that soul tool didn’t have any special characteristics at all. Only certain cities would use bursting cannons for defense, and broadly speaking, beast-ranked soul engineer legions rarely used them. They preferred more destructive weapons such as piercing cannons, which were more effective against protective soul barriers, or decomposition cannons and whatnot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They paused in midair for almost five minutes, and their linked soul tools were maintained at their highest possible levels from the beginning to the end. But their enemy never appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand, and held his bursting cannon with the other. A cold grin appeared on his face as Tang Wutong glanced at him confusedly. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered, “I’m just telling them that I’m here, so that they’ll be more careful and more vigilant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was extremely intelligent, and she immediately understood what Huo Yuhao was trying to say after a moment’s contemplation. “You’re making them maintain their peak condition at all times! You’re so evil.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I’m evil? They’re not nice people, either. Haih, I wonder how Dou Ling City’s doing. I do hope that third senior brother and the others can help stabilize the situation there. At least, I hope they can maintain internal order.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong lamented, “Their scheme is so cruel and cunning. If the Dou Ling Empire’s elites at the front lines find out about their royal palace, they might just charge out from Shrek City for a showdown with the Sun Moon Empire. If they do that, they will have fallen into Ju Zi’s trap. Ju Zi is so good at this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded silently. He was also more worried about what Tang Wutong was worried about. Ju Zi’s plan just made you helpless in trying to foil it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No matter what, we have to obliterate these two soul engineer legions before anything else. We can’t fight the Sun Moon Empire on an open battlefield anymore, so the only thing we can do is weaken their forces continuously. They can produce many soul tools, but training elite and outstanding soul engineers takes time. As long as we can weaken their soul engineer forces continuously, the day will come when the Sun Moon Empire is no longer so formidable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two legions realized that they had been tricked as Huo Yuhao spoke, and they continued on their way. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to search for them, but Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were too powerful. They didn’t dare to disperse at all! They could only ensure their safety by maintaining their linked defensive barriers, but that meant that they had to continuously expend soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had already fought back at Ling Dou City. No matter how many elites the Dou Ling Empire had mobilized, Dou Ling City was the empire’s capital city after all, and it still had to be defended to quite an extent. The two beast-ranked legions had already expended quite some strength dealing with the city defense army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had suffered Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s ambush afterwards, and retreated immediately. They hadn’t had any proper rest from the beginning until now. At the very least, they had to continue flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soul engineer’s soul power was very limited. Even in the world of soul masters, not many could regenerate their soul power in battle like Huo Yuhao could, to the point that flying wasn’t a problem for him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Titled Douluo would still have to expend some energy when maintaining high flight speeds, not to mention the fact that most soul engineers in the two legions only had around four soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They relied on their flying-type soul tools, Milk Bottles, and other equipment to continue flying for prolonged periods. But this period was ultimately limited, no matter how long it might be, not to mention the fact that they had to maintain their linked defensive barriers as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the two legion commanders’ expressions darkened when they realized that their enemy hadn’t appeared. They understood what their enemy was doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a very simple yet effective tactic on the battlefield, and that was harassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Harassment meant you couldn’t leave as quickly as you could. Harassment meant you had to maintain vigilance, and that you didn’t have a chance to rest at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn’t a problem for top-tier soul engineers, but their subordinates couldn’t do that. Their soul power would be completely expended given enough time, and when the time came when they couldn’t maintain their linked defensive formation, then perhaps the end of their world would arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What should we do, brother Xia?” Xu Tianyuan whispered at Xia Xuanchen. He didn’t want his men to hear him, because not everyone understood the tough situation they were in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen’s expression was black. “I’m afraid we’re in a lot of trouble, brother Xu. Our enemies are both powerful and meticulous. Since they’ve chosen to harass us like this, then they will definitely keep doing it. The only thing we can do is conserve soul power as much as possible, and put as much distance as possible between us and Dou Ling City. Afterwards, we have to find a place to rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianyuan asked, “Are you saying that we have to find a relatively remote area, and one legion will stand guard while the other legion rests, so that we can allow our men to recover their soul power?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen nodded and said, “That’s our only option. These two are extremely formidable, and they are able to jump through space. We may not be able to stop them even if we set a trap, and we will have to pay a hefty price for that attempt. Right now, we can only be conservative, and keep this up as long as we can. As long as we can allow our brothers to recover continuously so that they can maintain their fighting strength, I believe the two of them will retreat, given enough time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianyuan punched his palm as he spoke with a livid expression. “We’re too stifled. If I ever catch those two fellows, I’ll rip their bodies into a million pieces.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen forced a laugh and said, “Remain calm, brother Xu. Our brothers are watching. This is the only thing we can do. At least, those two don’t dare to attack us in the open. It’s too bad we’re so close to Dou Ling City.”</span></p>
