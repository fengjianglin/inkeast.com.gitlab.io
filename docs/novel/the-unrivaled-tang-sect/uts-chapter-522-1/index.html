 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli had been following the White Tiger Duke, Dai Hao, and he stared at Huo Yuhao with eyes brimming with excitement. He wanted to say something, but Huo Yuhao stopped him with a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na and Princess Jiujiu came forward to make their greetings one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From their perspective, Huo Yuhao naturally couldn’t compare to these people standing inside the tent in terms of strength. But in terms of status, he was either at the same status with everyone else, or perhaps even greater. He could be considered a key figure who had turned the tide of battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao greeted everyone one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Titled Douluo had different expressions when they looked at him. The Body Douluo, Du Busi had no expression at all, but the other Titled Douluo mostly reacted with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were the last to arrive out of everyone who was participating in this operation. Some of the others had been here for a day or two, while there were some who had been here for six or seven days. Even though Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong weren’t late, that disparity caused some of the most powerful individuals in the world of soul masters to be displeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke held Huo Yuhao’s hand and walked inside with him before he turned to everyone else and said, “Come, let me make an introduction. Huo Yuhao is a gifted student from Shrek Academy, and he is known as the Eye of the Asura. Don’t look down on him because he’s young. Back then, he was a great help to us, and the Star Luo Empire probably wouldn’t have been able to retake the Ming Dou Mountain Range without him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Titled Douluo who were here were naturally split into three different parties according to which empire they were from. The Titled Douluo who were from the Star Luo Empire all smiled and tilted their heads slightly as a gesture of amiability and friendliness. They had fought side by side with Huo Yuhao back then, and they had sufficiently experienced the tremendous benefit that his Spiritual Detection conferred on the battlefield. Furthermore, he had triggered the Beast God’s strength in an epic battle against the Death God Douluo. That gave the Giant Hammer Douluo, the Shattered Star Douluo, and the others a deep and lasting impression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Titled Douluo from the Heavenly Soul Empire were comparatively more boastful and arrogant. Even though they knew this individual was closely and directly related to the tremendous explosion that had occurred inside the Sun Moon Empire’s army, many of Shrek Academy’s powerful individuals were there after all. From their perspective, that success was more attributable to Elder Song and Yan Shaozhe’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dou Ling Empire’s Titled Douluo were most unfamiliar with Huo Yuhao. These Titled Douluo were the ones who were clearly displeased that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had arrived so long after everyone else did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What were Titled Douluo? They held strategic importance within a nation, and any Titled Douluo enjoyed an extremely elevated status in their respective empires. They all possessed a kind of arrogance and pride that was unique to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the Dou Ling Empire’s Titled Douluo looked on as the White Tiger Duke was so warm and passionate to Huo Yuhao even though he had arrived late. He smiled plainly and said, “You’re too modest, Duke. We know that credit for reclaiming the Ming Dou Mountain Range belongs to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke wasn’t stupid, and he could immediately tell the displeasure in this elderly man’s tone. He hurriedly said to Huo Yuhao, “Come, Yuhao. Let me make the introductions. This is the Heavenly Sun Douluo, and he’s from the Dou Ling Empire. He’s a hundred and fifty years old, and he’s belongs to the world of soul masters’ older generation. He’s a Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo, and he’s very powerful. This operation is directed mainly by the Body Douluo and the Heavenly Sun Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, Heavenly Sun Douluo.” Huo Yuhao gave the Heavenly Sun Douluo a light bow. He probably wasn’t that different from him in terms of seniority. Huo Yuhao was the Dragon God Douluo Mu En’s disciple, and Elder Mu had been more than two hundred years old when he had passed away. Therefore, Huo Yuhao was actually considered very senior, as he was here as Shrek Academy’s representative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo saw that Huo Yuhao only bowed a little, and displeasure immediately appeared in his eyes. He said plainly, “Heroes emerge from the younger generation after all! The new generation of youngsters is better than the older ones. Seems like us old ones are indeed quickly retreating from history.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na laughed and said, “Don’t say that, Heavenly Sun Douluo. You’re old, but still strong and healthy. You can still reign supreme over the world of soul masters for another hundred years without any problems.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s attitude was a lot better towards Princess Wei Na as he chuckled and said, “I can’t live for another hundred years. Perhaps brother Du might have a chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi said plainly, “That’s enough. Let’s not flatter each other. Since everyone is here, let’s prepare for the operation, as time is of the essence. Dai Hao, you’re the one who came up with the plan. Tell us about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke nodded and said, “Our operation is called the Emperor Killing Operation, and will be jointly executed by five Titled Douluo each from the Heavenly Soul Empire, the Dou Ling Empire, and the Star Luo Empire. We will proceed to the Sun Moon Empire and assassinate the emperor, Xu Tianran.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even though Xu Tianran is still young, he’s an incredibly ruthless and ambitious character of his generation. War in the future is inevitable as long as he’s around. The Sun Moon Empire is becoming stronger, and we will lose the initiative and end up on the back foot if we don’t make a move. The Sun Moon Empire will descend into chaos if we can assassinate Xu Tianran. His brothers will definitely fight with each other for the throne. After all, his son hasn’t been born for too long, and it’ll be hard for him to ascend to the throne when he’s only a year old.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thought occurred to Huo Yuhao as he heard the White Tiger Duke’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s son… doesn’t that mean he’s also Ju Zi’s child? Ju Zi has given him a child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s voice and smile surfaced in Huo Yuhao’s mind, and a kind of discomfort surfaced in his heart. No matter what, he shared some sentiments with her back then. He had saved her life before, and she had saved his. This time, their operation was targeted at the Sun Moon Empire’s emperor, Xu Tianran, who was also Ju Zi’s husband! If they successfully assassinated Xu Tianran, Ju Zi would no longer have a husband, and her child would no longer have a father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh inside as his thoughts stopped there. Ju Zi was right that his heart was too soft, especially toward people that he cared about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not even Tang Wutong knew about the thoughts that were surfacing in Huo Yuhao’s mind. She thought that he was a little moody because he had met the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke continued, “It is undoubtedly extremely difficult to assassinate Xu Tianran. But the Douluo Continent’s three native empires will benefit greatly if our operation is successful. That’s the reason why I have invited everyone to take this risk in this operation. From my perspective, the most crucial component of our operation is how we are to enter the Sun Moon Empire’s territory and infiltrate Radiant City. As long as we can infiltrate Radiant City undetected, we will have practically completed half of our mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our spies in the Sun Moon Empire have risked death to relay some intel to us. Roughly seven days from now, Xu Tianran will participate in the Sun Moon Empire’s Grand Sacrificial Ceremony. He’s the emperor, so he will undoubtedly be the one performing the sacrificial rites at the ceremony. That’s the best opportunity for us to execute our mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, there will undoubtedly be many powerful individuals by his side during the ceremony. Furthermore, the Sun Moon Empire is adept with all kinds of soul tools. Xu Tianran definitely has a formidable automatic soul tool on him. Therefore, we have to draw the expert fighters by his side away if we wish to assassinate him. So, we have to split our operation into two parts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All fifteen members will be divided into two teams. The Body Douluo will lead one, while the Heavenly Sun Douluo will lead the other. The Body Douluo will lead the four other Transcendent Douluo, with the exception of the Heavenly Sun Douluo, and they will prepare to give Xu Tianran a thunderous and fatal blow. The Heavenly Sun Douluo will take the others to create a diversion during the day of the Grand Sacrificial Ceremony.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The target of our diversion will be the arsenals inside Radiant City. There are many arsenals in Radiant City, but the most important arsenal is in the city’s eastern outskirts. It’s relatively far from where the ceremony will be held, and it stores large masses of sealed Milk Bottles and stationary soul cannon shells. Once the arsenal is attacked, the disturbance will be large enough that Xu Tianran will be alerted. They will be sent into disarray, and the Body Douluo’s opportunity will arise when that happens. They will attack Xu Tianran amid the chaos, and everyone will retreat after a single strike. Please be safe, everyone, whether or not the mission is successful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plan didn’t sound very complicated, but there were definitely many problems with the details.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How they were to infiltrate the Sun Moon Empire and then Radiant City would be a very important problem before they could even execute their mission. The plan wasn’t very intricate, and everything had to be played by ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned a little after listening to the White Tiger Duke’s plan. A plan that was as vague as this definitely had less than a fifty percent chance of success. Furthermore, their assassination target was the Sun Moon Empire’s emperor. How could the White Tiger Duke have a plan like that? This wasn’t like his standard at all! The White Tiger Duke shouldn’t make a mistake like that with his intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This operation had an absolutely magnificent lineup. The Body Sect’s leader, Du Busi was still a Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo, even if he his cultivation hadn’t increased for a long time. He was second only to an Ultimate Douluo. And even though the Heavenly Sun Douluo seemed a little displeased with Huo Yuhao, he was still a Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo; he was likely to be the strongest individual in the Dou Ling Empire. They were at the helm of this operation. If the operation failed and they died in the process, it would be a fatal blow to the Douluo Continent’s three native empires!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had many doubts in his mind, but he was the youngest here, so it wasn’t very appropriate for him to ask too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi nodded and said, “That’s roughly the plan, but we have to talk more about the details. There isn’t much time left, and we have to infiltrate the Sun Moon Empire as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke nodded as he turned towards Huo Yuhao beside him. “Yuhao, concealment and infiltration are your strengths. Do you have a way of bringing everyone into the Sun Moon Empire’s territory without being discovered?”</span></p>
