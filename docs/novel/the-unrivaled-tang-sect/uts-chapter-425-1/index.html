It was like some aspect had been miscalculated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what the power of destiny was telling him. However, it was very unclear. He only felt something, but he couldn’t think of what was wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, and the Sun Moon Empire still seemed to have no intention of invading further. All surveillance at the borders was performed using aerial surveillance soul tools, and the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineering legions filled the airspace completely. This meant that any surveillance attempts by the Star Luo Empire against the Sun Moon Empire’s forces would be futile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke did send some powerful individuals to survey the situation, but there was a high concentration of aerial surveillance soul tools and thermal detectors over the Sun Moon Empire’s forces. If they got close to a certain region, they would immediately be discovered. Once discovered, they would be attacked by powerful soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What exactly is the Sun Moon Empire doing? Even if they just wanted to consolidate their borders, wouldn’t three days be enough? Since they started this war, they should have completed their preparations and been ready to launch an all-out attack now! However, why aren’t they doing anything? Why did they give the Star Luo Empire enough time to gather and deploy their military?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had been thinking about this for many days, and the discomfort he felt grew more intense</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was obviously an advantageous situation for the Star Luo Empire. The longer their enemies delayed, the closer their reinforcements would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within these three days, six soul master legions, the Northwestern Field Army, and the Western Field Army had already gathered. Along with the original soul master legion, there were now eight other soul master legions. This already comprised eighty percent of the Star Luo Empire’s fighting strength! Even though the First Soul Master Legion had suffered great losses, they still possessed fighting strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current lineup showed the determination of the Star Luo Empire. Princess Jiujiu personally led the front line forces and had already met up with the White Tiger Duke in Dawn City. She was also the commander of all six soul master legions that had arrived as reinforcements. After all, she couldn’t just hand over such great authority to the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Yun also received news that the Dou Ling Empire’s reinforcements had arrived in the Star Luo Empire’s territory. They split into two waves with the Star Luo Empire’s own reinforcements and were rushing to the front line now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed like the situation was slowly stabilizing. In slightly more than ten days, all the reinforcements would have arrived. Adding in the Star Luo Empire’s preparations, the Sun Moon Empire wouldn’t find it easy to succeed in their invasion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao idled over these few days. After becoming Xu Yun’s bodyguard, and as war was about to break out, he didn’t need to train every day. He just needed to follow Xu Yun as she attended meeting after meeting. However, he and Dai Luoli couldn’t listen in on the exact details, given their status. Huo Yuhao spent more of his time on his own cultivation. As for his identity, Xu Yun stopped probing. Whether it was her or Dai Luoli, they treated him as someone sent by the White Tiger Duke. Otherwise, how could they explain the conditions surrounding Dai Luoli’s White Tiger Awakening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Dai Luoli’s martial soul Awakened, his cultivation improved by leaps and bounds under Huo Yuhao’s guidance. He was about to reach Rank 40. Once he obtained four soul rings, he could become a Soul Ancestor. He was also very hardworking. Unless Xu Yun summoned him, he would remain in his room to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was also very reassured that his little brother was so hardworking. At least he hadn’t wasted his energy teaching him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. The first batch of reinforcements from the Heavenly Soul Empire, consisting of thirty thousand soldiers, had already arrived. Furthermore, they brought twenty Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons along, which came from the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Luo Empire had been attacked by the Sun Moon Empire, and Shrek Academy naturally knew about this. After the Academy discussed it with the Tang Sect, the Tang Sect decided to supply all types of soul tools to the Star Luo Empire first, especially their Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons. The effective range of such a cannon was impressive, which made it very useful for defensive purposes. This theory had been tested against the beast tide from the Great Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why has there been no movement yet? This is weird.” Dai Luoli sat on his bed and muttered. He had just eaten his dinner. At this time every day, he would ask Huo Yuhao for guidance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked outside and saw that it had already turned dark. He agreed, “Yes! It has been seven days since the war has started. Even if they were consolidating their foundations, the Sun Moon Empire’s next attack should have started already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli said, “The most hateful thing is that those fellows completely cut off all our surveillance of them. We have no news of what’s happening at the border. I really don’t know what they want. Soul tools are too despicable. Extensive surveillance has already been performed on the borders of our Star Luo Empire and the Heavenly Soul Empire. It was already very difficult to find out what the Sun Moon Empire was up to back then. Those fellows are too mysterious. I don’t know what intentions they’re harboring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Dai Luoli’s words, Huo Yuhao’s body suddenly shook. “Mysterious and sealing all surveillance? Don’t tell me there’s some kind of scheme? Luoli, continue your cultivation. I’ll go out and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was stunned for a moment. “Brother Dong, what are you doing? Are you going to the front line? It’s different now than before. The sky is filled with their aerial surveillance soul tools. Once they discover you, it’ll be difficult for you to come back. Don’t take the risk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Recently, the two of them had drawn closer to each other, especially after the war started. Huo Yuhao stopped beating him up, and even passed down all types of cultivation methods and experiences to him without holding back anything. To Dai Luoli, Huo Yuhao was both a mentor and a friend right now. Naturally, he didn’t want Huo Yuhao to do anything reckless. Furthermore, he and Xu Yun already treated Huo Yuhao as someone sent by the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Dong was definitely not a spy. If he were a spy, there wasn’t any use for him to be a lowly soldier, given his abilities. He would at least be part of a soul master legion for him to be of any use, and to obtain useful information. However, he stayed in the recruits’ camp, and only guided Dai Luoli every day. Whoever it was, they would certainly think that Huo Yuhao was an instructor the White Tiger Duke had especially found to guide Dai Luoli. The only problem was that he was a little too young.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for his violent teaching methods, it was probably because he had been beaten into a martial soul evolution. Dai Luoli didn’t hate him for using such a method. He felt that his improvement seemed to be slower now than when he was being beaten up by Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and shook his head before saying, “Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. I’m just going out to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me follow you then,” Dai Luoli said, a little impulsively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned for a moment. “You?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli nodded determinedly. “I’m about to go crazy being cooped up in this city every day.” In fact, he wasn’t the only one who thought that way. Almost all of the Star Luo Empire’s military felt the same way. They were extremely tense waiting for the war to continue. The Sun Moon Empire’s military had yet to arrive, but they were still under great psychological pressure. Under such circumstances, all of them were under great stress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pondered for a moment before saying, “Alright, I can bring you along. However, you must keep everything that you find out along the way a secret. You can’t even tell Xu Yun, or your father when you see him in the future. If you promise me this, I’ll bring you along.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was stunned. He looked at Huo Yuhao’s serious face and was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So serious? Weren’t you sent by my father? Why can’t I tell him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the doubt on his face, Huo Yuhao said after remaining silent for a moment, “Let me show you something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After these few days of interaction, he had gained a deeper comprehension of Dai Luoli’s character. After weighing the pros and cons, he made a decision.</span></p>
