Suddenly, her left hand grabbed the cauldron, and she stepped forward with her left leg. She cried out in a girly voice, and her entire body made one rotation with the tip of her left foot as the axis. She lifted the 1.5-meter-wide and tall cauldron, charged it with a ghastly gale of wind, and threw it in Qin Yueyue’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So violent…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Huo Yuhao could not help but open his eyes wide in shock. Since when did Xiao Xiao, who was normally so gentle, become so violent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yueyue cried out as she stepped forward with her left leg. She sliced forward with the knife in her hand as she slashed at the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron with her blade. For the first time, the body of her blade came into direct contact with the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, an ear-shattering sound like a bell being struck could be heard. The cauldron’s trajectory was interrupted by the huge knife, and suddenly, it started to drop vertically. Qin Yueyue was sent back three steps by the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Xiao Xiao had already rushed up. She pursued her falling Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron as she pushed forward with her hands. A layer of black light rose around her body as the cauldron continued its trajectory to smash into Qin Yueyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distance was too close, and the cauldron was too big and heavy. It was impossible to even dodge it. Qin Yueyue could only place her knife horizontally before her as she tried to forcefully block the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a bang as the blade of the knife bent slightly, and Qin Yueyue’s entire body was sent flying backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she was no weakling. After she was sent flying back through the air, she lifted the knife high above her head. Her third soul ring started to shine, and as she swung her hands upward, she was already grabbing onto the bottommost portion of the knife. She chopped down with it forcefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, a blade light about ten meters long descended from the sky relentlessly towards Xiao Xiao. It brimmed with a reinvigorated aura that seemed capable of slicing the arena in two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao instantly felt as if there were nowhere for her to hide. The area around her appeared to have been tightly sealed off, but she remained fearless. Her second soul ring started to shine, and she lifted the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron up into the air, blocking the area above her head. The already humongous cauldron grew even bigger, and soon, it was three meters wide. A powerful black light shone around it once more and enveloped Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another deafening sound. Xiao Xiao’s body bent over slightly, and one could see that half of the green blade light had disappeared in the black light. The rest was blocked by the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron and disintegrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following that, Xiao Xiao chucked the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron in her hands out once more. It went after Qin Yueyue, who had just landed unevenly on the ground. Xiao Xiao’s attacks were indeed forceful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Tang Sect’s waiting zone, Huo Yuhao could not help but laugh. “Xiao Xiao is such a mace!” Ever since he had returned from his exchange program, he had yet to fight her despite having trained with her many times. As a person, Xiao Xiao was not flashy or flamboyant. Huo Yuhao had not known that Xiao Xiao, whose style was mainly defense and control, had such a violent battling style. From her battling style, did she not resemble an assault-type soul master? She was indeed a pupil of Elder Xuan!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sharp glint flashed in Qin Yueyue’s eyes. Xiao Xiao was putting a lot of pressure on her, giving her no respite. She barely managed to stabilize herself before the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron came at her again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She stabbed the huge knife into the ground, penetrating it. Qin Yueyue’s entire body started to shine with a green glow. With that, one could hear a series of metallic noises, and her entire body was quickly covered by a suit of armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a completely green full suit of armor, and was looked extremely heavy and thick. Qin Yueyue’s body became extremely sturdy, like a goddess of war. As the armor appeared, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron was already in front of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yueyue used her right hand to push her knife outward. She had no intention of dodging, but instead attempted to face it head-on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron was sent flying back. Qin Yueyue pulled out her huge knife, and a light flashed behind her back. She leapt into the sky, and came slashing down at Xiao Xiao with her weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such power! Xiao Xiao was startled. The increase in her opponent’s power evidently came from her suit of armor. This should be her close-combat soul tool. It was a wonderful combination. With the power of the armor, she increased the power of her blade. Compared to her first two teammates, Qin Yueyue’s abilities were in no way weaker!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron returned to its original position. Xiao Xiao lifted it up with her hands and once more, it acted as a shield above her head. Despite a deafening clang of impact, she was unable to make Qin Yueyue retreat. Instead, she sank down into the metallic floor of the arena.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that she had the upper hand, Qin Yueyue showed no mercy. She sliced repeatedly and frantically down at Xiao Xiao, as if she had gone crazy. With each strike, an intense blade light shone. While Xiao Xiao was able to block her offense with the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, she was still forced into a retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yueyue’s armor not only increased her strength, but also increased her soul power. As a close-combat soul master, she did not need to increase the power of her weapon and hence, her soul tool was this armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Xiao Xiao was sent into a retreat, her fighting capabilities were slowly being revealed. When she realized that she could not match her opponent in strength, she decided to change her strategy. She started to spin the cauldron in her hand and activated her Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track. She stopped trying to fight her opponent head-on, but instead tried to stabilize her position by fighting defensively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By activating her martial soul and the soul armor, her opponent was definitely going to be more drained than her. This was the thought going through Xiao Xiao’s mind. Furthermore, she was a twin-souled soul master! While her soul power was not as good as Wang Dong’er’s, she was one of the top few soul masters with five soul rings. Hence, she was in no rush, and behaved even more calmly than Wang Dong’er had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi, who was watching the match, muttered to himself, “Why does Xiao Xiao resemble a defense-type soul master more than me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first two rounds had ended rather quickly. The third round ended in a defeat for the Clearjade Sect, as its captain had attacked prematurely. The current match was the most intense. The two sides clashed with unparalleled ferocity and intensity, exciting everyone in the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another blow from the blade was deflected by the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. A sense of futility surfaced in Qin Yueyue’s mind. She suddenly felt that the cauldron before her was akin to an insurmountable mountain. Even with all her strength, she could not do much to it. It was not a good feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oh no, my soul power is being depleted too quickly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst the helplessness, Qin Yueyue suddenly understood that this was because she lacked the energy to continue her offense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao had been waiting for this moment all this while. However, she did not try to beat Qin Yueyue back quickly. Instead, she hoped to train herself up and at the same time, conceal her true abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao instantly felt Qin Yueyue’s sudden loss in energy. Immediately after Yueyue clashed with her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron once more, Xiao Xiao took a step forward. She held onto one side of the cauldron with both arms. Then, she pushed forward with one arm and pulled with the other. She was using a secret technique of the Tang Sect, Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron started to spin. Qin Yueyue spun along with it as her blade was pulled to one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao cried out, and then her hands went down, and the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron started to expand once more. Its first soul ring started to shine and the huge cauldron dropped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a huge boom, a vast amount of black gas started to spread outward. Defenseless, Qin Yueyue was sent flying back from this cloud of black gas.</span></p>

In terms of soul skills, there was still some distance between her and a real soul master, as she relied more on her soul tools. After such a long fight, Xiao Xiao had yet to use any soul skill. Even Qin Yueyue had forgotten that she was fighting a soul master and not a close-combat soul engineer like herself.</span></p>

Thanks to it, her body was sent flying into the air. She could feel a hum in her armor, and she suddenly felt nauseous from this blow. In her heart, she knew that something was amiss, but it was too late.</span></p>

Her second soul ring started to shine. Cauldron Sweep!</span></p>

Qin Yueyue had nowhere to run, and was sent flying by this powerful move. In mid-air, she spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao leapt into the air. She grabbed the shrinking cauldron, and her body spun and sent the cauldron flying out. It sliced through the air with a terrifying sound as it made its way toward her opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I admit defeat!” Qin Yueyue cried out in mid-air.</span></p>

The Clearjade Sect was not weak, and they even had some unique abilities. However, they had been forced into a tight corner by the Tang Sect. No wonder they were able to beat the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy! If this went on, this team would be one of the favorites for the championship title.</span></p>

On his other side, Qin Yueyue fell to the ground, leaning on her knife. While her protective soul tool was able to absorb most of the impact from that blow, her innards were still shaking from the shock.</span></p>
