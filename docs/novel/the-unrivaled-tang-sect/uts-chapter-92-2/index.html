 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 92.2: The Decisive 3v3 Battle!</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simply didn’t take any of that into consideration. At this moment, their hearts were interlinked, their soul powers combined. Borrowing the force of Huo Yuhao’s tug, Wang Dong was now behind him. He was already prepared to act as a background figure in this match. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong simply did not think about such matters. At this very moment, their hearts were linked, and their soul power was combined. Wang Dong ducked as he pulled Huo Yuhao behind him. He was already completely prepared to play the role of the supporting cast in this battle.</p>
 <p>Regardless of whether it was him or Huo Yuhao, they wouldn’t be able to take on a powerful opponent by themselves. However, the fact that they were companions with a one hundred percent compatibility rate couldn’t be forgotten! The two of them could rival even a Soul Ancestor if they working together. Neither him nor Huo Yuhao would be able to contend against the enemy before them alone, however, one must never forget that they were companions that possessed a one hundred percent martial soul fusion rate! Their combined might was already enough to match a Soul Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong stuck to Huo Yuhao’s back in a very natural manner. As he held onto the latter’s waist, he released his Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>From the front, Wang Dong looked as if he had already disappeared. It was as if Huo Yuhao had grown a pair of dazzling wings, whose bluish-golden light radiated throughout the entire arena.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess wasn’t the strongest martial soul that had appeared in the tournament, but up till now, there was definitely no other one that could be compared to it in terms of beauty.</p>
 <p>As the Haodong Power circulated through his body, Huo Yuhao took a step forward and reached Bei Bei. After ‘fusing’ with Wang Dong, he wanted to rely on their combined strength to help his senior brother fight.</p>
 <p>“Senior brother, we’ll fight alongside you.” Huo Yuhao’s voice was clearly somewhat low. At this moment, a golden light flickered through his eyes, and a few shades of jade-green were hidden within them.</p>
 <p>“Okay!” Bei Bei shouted, taking the initiative to charge towards his opponents. Wang Dong unfurled his wings, allowing Huo Yuhao to follow his senior brother by flying in a manner that seemed as though he was gliding over the floor.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection had already enveloped the entire stage.</p>
 <p>With Ye Wuqing leading the team, the three students from Justsky Academy released their martial souls. Their martial souls could be said to be somewhat unique, and one had no choice but to admit that Justsky Academy--which relied on the cultivation of martial souls while rejecting the use of soul tools--was somewhat unique when selecting and nurturing students.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Can shut his eyes, causing a faint layer of mist to diffuse from his body. This mist wasn’t white, but faint blue.</p>
 <p>This faint blue mist coiled about and rose into the air, making his body faintly discernible and filling his person with an aura of mystery.</p>
 <p>Following a series of crisp bell rings, an ancient bell appeared in his right hand. This bell was very large, and its wooden handle alone was already more than a foot long. The front section of the bell was dark blue, and there were three magical blue balls within it. The collision between these balls and the bell itself was what caused the ringing sounds.</p>
 <p>The reason why it was called magical was because these three balls were actually flickering with light as they rocked about within the bell. They resembled three small eyes that continuously opened and closed. One of the balls was cold, the other was hot, and the last was demonic. It was truly an extremely peculiar martial soul.</p>
 <p>Two yellow and two purple soul rings started to undulate about his body. As he took a few steps back, Shangguan Can squinted his eyes, gazing at Huo Yuhao’s body.</p>
 <p>Over at the other side, the girl known as Yan’er had a martial soul that related to fire, as her name implied. Her current appearance was even more peculiar. At this moment, she was floating in the air, held up by a half-meter-wide fireball. Her hands were outstretched from her body, and her arms were slightly bent. She held a palm-sized fireball in each of her hands. There was no doubt about it--her martial soul was a Fireball. It wasn’t an elemental martial soul like the one Ling Luochen possessed, but it was a material elemental martial soul that was slightly inferior to hers.</p>
 <p>In contrast to them, Ye Wuqing’s martial soul wasn’t too peculiar. A long and narrow gold leaf had quietly floated in front of him, and his soul rings also surrounded him. He then raised his right hand, using his index and middle fingers to hold this leaf.</p>
 <p>This was Ye Wuqing’s martial soul, the Golden Leaf. However, he was an assault-type soul master.</p>
 <p>Yan’er was the first person on the battlefield to make a move. As she pressed her hands together, she shouted, “Go!”</p>
 <p>Immediately, the two fireballs in her palms fused together. This fusion didn’t look too important, but a foot-wide fireball suddenly flew towards Bei Bei. Following that, Yan’er’s first soul ring lit up.</p>
 <p>While Yan’er made her move, Shangguan Can wasn’t slacking about either. He gently shook his Soulsucking Bell, causing a series of jingles to ring out. Waves of twitchiness flooded Bei Bei, Huo Yuhao, and Wang Dong’s minds, and they became absent-minded for an instant.</p>
 <p>Spiritual Interference?</p>
 <p>The corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth twitched for a moment. Although he didn’t know the correct name of his opponent’s soul skill, he could guarantee that this was something akin to his Spiritual Interference.</p>
 <p>“Pipe down a little!” Huo Yuhao shouted coldly as he counterattacked without any traces of politeness at all. A purplish-golden light instantly shot out from his eyes, targetting Shangguan Can’s Soulsucking Bell.</p>
 <p>If Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were truly two-ringed Soul Grandmasters, the former’s strength in spiritual-type skills wouldn’t be too great. Moreover, whatever skill he could release would be weakened by his first white soul ring--this was what Shangguan Can thought. He was an auxiliary control-type soul master, making him somewhat similar to Xiao Xiao. He was called an auxiliary-type soul master, but he didn’t strengthen his teammates; he weakened his opponents. For example, his first soul skill would affect the minds of all opponents within a certain range, and cancel the lock-on effects of any other soul skills. Shangguan Can could be considered to be quite skillful in its use.</p>
 <p>However, he would never have thought that he would encounter a pure spiritual-type soul master like Huo Yuhao. Shangguan Can still needed to rely on his Soulsucking Bell to unleash his soul skills, but Huo Yuhao’s spiritual-type abilities were purely reliant on the use of his eyes. A body soul was naturally much stronger than his tool soul.</p>
 <p>With Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Sharing, losing lock-on effects simply wouldn’t bother any of his teammates. Furthermore, wouldn’t Huo Yuhao still be able to hit his opponent using his Spiritual Shock?</p>
 <p>Because of that, Shangguan Can was somewhat unprepared when facing Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock.</p>
 <p>One shouldn’t assume that Huo Yuhao was weak just because of his two soul rings. Even a Soul King-ranked expert like Shen Ce had to suffer a loss from his Spiritual Shock.</p>
 <p>With Wang Dong’s help and the amplification provided by the Haodong Power, Huo Yuhao’s soul power was sufficient to step into the threshold of four-ringed Soul Ancestors. Although he had fewer soul rings, all of them were equivalent to thousand year soul rings in terms of power, and his Spiritual Shock was further strengthened by his Purple Demon Eyes.</p>
 <p>After being strengthened, his soul skill was already sufficiently powerful to take on anyone below the Soul Emperor rank. Only if his opponent was prepared, or his spiritual power was not powerful enough, would he suffer a large backlash.</p>
 <p>A purplish-golden light instantly shot out, and Shangguan Can felt an irresistible, sharp spiritual power rush into his mind. He felt like his head had been fiercely smashed by a metal hammer, and two jets of fresh blood instantly shot out from his nose. He stumbled and nearly fell down, causing his first soul skill to immediately end.</p>
 <p><em>What a powerful spiritual-type attack skill!</em>&nbsp;Astonished, Shangguan Can violently shook the Soulsucking Bell in his hand. An ear-piercing jingle brought about a powerful sound wave, causing Huo Yuhao’s trio to feel as though their heads were exploding. This was especially true for Huo Yuhao, who had just suffered a backlash after using his Spiritual Shock. His footsteps slowed down a bit, and he let out a muffled groan.</p>
 <p>This was the Soulsucking Bell’s second soul skill, Souldeath.</p>
 <p>At this exact moment, Yan’er’s Fireball finally reached Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei raised his right hand, sending a claw-shaped bolt of purplish-blue lightning forward. This bolt of lightning collided with the fireball in midair, causing a violent boom to ring out. Bei Bei wasn’t stopped at all, but his Thunderous Dragon Claw had been drained by the Fireball.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei clearly had a better martial soul, but he was slightly inferior to Yan’er in terms of soul power. When both parties used their first soul skills, they ended up being equal.</p>
 <p>Yan’er let out a relaxed sigh after seeing the results of their clash. Since their opponent was an assault-type soul master who wasn’t even her equal in cultivation, how could they have any chance of defeating her side?</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing made a move as well. His style of attacking was something that no one present would’ve expected. He flung out the leaf he held between his fingers, his second soul ring lighting up as he did so. However, the very dazzling Golden Leaf didn’t seem to possess any power as it was flung out. More mysteriously, it seemed as though Ye Wuqing had made a mistake. The leaf’s landing point was still two to three metres away from Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao, creating a seemingly powerless parabola.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing had chosen an extremely good time to attack; this was just as Shangguan Can had released his Souldeath.</p>
 <p>Affected by Shangguan Can’s Souldeath, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing turned sluggish for a brief moment. At that moment, the Golden Leaf landed on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ding—” The Golden Leaf landed, causing a crisp peal to ring out. Right after that, it unexpectedly ricocheted. Furthermore, its originally yellow-gold surface suddenly turned pure gold as it tripled in speed and shot towards Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>However, the Golden Leaf didn’t land on Bei Bei. A small throwing knife seemed to coincidentally, yet extremely accurately, strike the Golden Leaf mid-flight.</p>
 <p>The two items collided, and the Golden Leaf was slowed down momentarily. After that, the throwing knife, which was of relatively decent quality, unexpectedly melted. Then, a violent boom rang out, turning into a pure-gold flare of light that swirled everywhere.</p>
 <p>The person who’d thrown the throwing knife was Huo Yuhao. Although his Spiritual Sharing had been affected temporarily, his own Spiritual Detection still worked. As the user of the skill, his spiritual power was the strongest of the six people participating in this match. Because of that, he had still grasped the trajectory of the Golden Leaf. At the critical moment, Huo Yuhao had used the Tang Sect’s technique of controlling hidden weapons to send a throwing knife to waste the power of the Golden Leaf.</p>
 <p>He had already felt that something was off the instant the Golden Leaf left Ye Wuqing’s hands, because he clearly sensed that the Golden Leaf contained an enormous, yet unstable soul power. This soul power immediately circulated in a peculiar fashion the instant it was thrown out. As a result, it would be strange if this thing was just that simple. After all, this was something released by an expert who was near the Soul Emperor rank of cultivation.</p>
