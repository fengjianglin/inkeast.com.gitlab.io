 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time that they’d cultivated together since their martial soul fusion. Compared to before, their Haodong Power was much denser and vaster. Huo Yuhao immediately felt his soul power improving, as well as the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence within his body being almost completely assimilated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Yan Shaozhe hadn’t known was that the main reason for his Ultimate Ice’s rapid rate of improvement and its temperature being so low was due to the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hadn’t unleashed his full strength during the practice battle, nor had he truly unleashed his Spirits, which also needed to be considered as part of his fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spirits were different from those of most soul masters. His Spirits’ consciousnesses had been stabilized through the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, thus they themselves possessed a certain level of strength. Once they were fully unleashed, they would be able to support and complement one another. Plus, with the amount of experience that the Snow Empress and the Ice Empress had, they’d probably have been able to hold out a bit longer against Yan Shaozhe, even though they couldn’t possibly have defeated him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong placed their palms against each other’s, after which their soul power rippled and undulated continuously within their bodies. Huo Yuhao’s soul power improved conspicuously with every circulation. Even though a soul master needed an immense amount of soul power to increase their cultivation rank by even a single rank after they became a Soul Douluo, Huo Yuhao still felt that he’d be able to reach the threshold of becoming a Titled Douluo during the next three years with his current cultivation speed! As someone who possessed an Ultimate martial soul, once he became a Titled Douluo, he’d have the strength to challenge a normal Transcendent Douluo by simply relying on his martial soul’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time continued to pass, Huo Yuhao remained completely immersed in his revelations and realizations, his emotions incessantly rippling as he did so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong is Dong’er, and she’s back by my side.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Just that single thought gave Huo Yuhao a lot of emotional clarity. Even though he’d lost his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills in the process, he didn’t regret anything for even a second. What could bring him more joy or pleasant surprise than his lover returning to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at the same time, he quickly realized how important emotions were for self-invented soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emotions were considered to be a part of spiritual power, yet at the same time, they weren’t equivalent; they could be considered an inexplicable force with an abstruse origin. Back then, the most important reason behind his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills being so powerful was due to them containing his intense emotions. At the same time, the repercussions and residual effects brought about after using them also stemmed from his emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since emotions can increase the power of self-invented soul skills, does that mean that I can fuse my emotions into my other self-invented soul skills now that I’ve lost my Three Ultimate Haodong Skills?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Goddess of Light was undoubtedly Huo Yuhao’s fundamental self-invented soul skill; the truth was that he’d adapted his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills from it. Thus, now that he couldn’t use them anymore, it seemed that he’d have to put more effort back into his Goddess of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The emotions that his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills relied on were longing and yearning. Now that Wutong was back by his side, those feelings had to transform—but into what?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Love, yes, love is the answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thought had barely surfaced in Huo Yuhao’s mind when he suddenly felt an intense quiver in his spiritual sea. In the next moment, the love in his heart immediately flooded towards Tang Wutong like a tidal wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s beautiful frame trembled a little in response. Her spiritual sea had originally been extremely messy and chaotic, as Wang Dong’er’s memory had only been awakened a short time ago, and she hadn’t yet managed to completely integrate the memories of her childhood. She felt her heart and body quiver intensely as she was stimulated by Huo Yuhao’s intense feelings of love, and a dash of rosiness appeared on her cheeks as her lips gradually tilted into a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These dense feelings of love surging into her mind were akin to the most potent natural treasures as they nourished her spiritual sea and supported the fusion of her memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Love was a notion for eternity—only love could truly last forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether she was Wang Dong’er or Tang Wutong didn’t matter—her name was only a label. Tang Wutong had insisted that she was Tang Wutong, rather than Wang Dong’er, because her memories hadn’t been completely fused yet. In her heart, she’d been a little afraid that her feelings towards Huo Yuhao weren’t genuine, which had caused her to have a little resistance towards him in her heart ever since recovering her memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But at this moment, as she was smothered in Huo Yuhao’s dense feelings, her memories began to fuse at an accelerated rate. Slowly, her entire being’s emotions began to change as she was continuously buffeted by his love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Dong’er’s originally deep-seated love for Huo Yuhao was guided out and took the driver’s seat, merging together with love that Huo Yuhao was emanating. Their Haodong Power quietly sublimated, while their love continued to ripple and undulate away from and because of that sublimation. They weren’t just fusing their martial souls anymore; their emotions and spirits were also fusing. This was the true meaning of coming together to become one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao felt the reciprocated love coming from Tang Wutong, he was overjoyed. Love was a mutual feeling, thus only with mutual love could it continue to sublimate and evolve. At this moment, the type of love that Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao were feeling was that type of sublimating love. Their overflowing emotions began to encircle their hearts and souls, and faint white halos appeared around their bodies. Gentle undulations could soon be seen as their bodies were cocooned in light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their soul power, spiritual power, and spirits were being rinsed and doused in their dense feelings of love. Slowly but surely, their soul power was changing, and the golden light from within the trident on Tang Wutong’s forehead began to circulate within her body. Strange transformations also began to happen to Huo Yuhao’s soul power and aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I love you, Dong’er. I love you, Wutong.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s voice was filled with love as it resonated within his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao felt his spirits be invigorated, and in the next moment felt his spiritual power seem to leave his body. He’d experienced a similar feeling before, but that was when he’d channeled his spiritual power out of his body. Now that his spiritual power was in the concrete-material realm, his spiritual power leaving his body along with his spirit didn’t mean anything was wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this time seemed different. Huo Yuhao studied himself closely, only to realize to his astonishment that it wasn’t his spiritual power that was leaving his body. Instead, it was his own, actual spirit leaving his body! Yes, just his spirit, without any spiritual power accompanying it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Human spirits were extremely weak; once they left one’s body, they would continuously dissipate. The moment that he realized his spirit was leaving his body, he quickly realized that there was also a faint white layer surrounding his spirit that seemed to be protecting it from dissipating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his spirit currently in midair, Huo Yuhao could see Tang Wutong and himself with their palms pressed against each other’s, cultivating. Gentle white light surrounded their bodies, and Huo Yuhao could still vividly feel their sublimating soul power, spiritual power, and emotions, despite currently looking down at himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s happening? Why has my spirit left my body by itself?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao attempted to control himself and return to his body, but he realized to his surprise that he couldn’t make his spirit move at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the next moment, some kind of strange force appeared in the ether than instantly pulled his spirit out of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Once his spirit exited the Golden Tree, it began to rise into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun was radiant outside, and shone down upon the entire Shrek Academy, but a shred of panic still appeared in Huo Yuhao’s mind. This was the first time that he’d come across such a strange situation; he had no idea what was going to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spirit had left his body, and was continuously rising through the air. It wasn’t a great feeling; Huo Yuhao could feel himself getting further and further away from his own body. Even though his senses were still connected, he couldn’t control his spirit’s movements in the sky at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is this happening? What’s happening to me?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t find the answer, intense fear and panic beginning to permeate his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been through so much to get Tang Wutong back at his side, yet his spirit had still left his body in such a strange fashion.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What exactly is happening? What’s happened?! No, I don’t want to leave. I don’t want to leave Wutong, I still have to protect and love her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Intense fear and panic caused a wave of acute emotional ripples to spread from his spirit, as he tried to struggle out of the restraints binding his movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at that moment, a gentle aura suddenly enveloped his spirit. This aura was extremely strange, as there seemed to be an immense amount of pure emotions undulating within it. After it appeared, Huo Yuhao felt an incredibly comfortable feeling course through his spirit, as if he’d been immersed in warm spring water. This nourishing feeling made him so comfortable that he wanted to moan, all traces of panic, fear, and negative emotions disappearing without a trace. Instead, small feelings of comfort and trust had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What exactly is happening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was extremely intelligent; if he couldn’t at least make a guess about his situation, then he wouldn’t be Huo Yuhao. The aura filled with comfort that had nourished his spirit had immediately made him realize that his spirit leaving his body wasn’t because of his own cultivation; rather, some external power had forcibly pulled his spirit from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the negative feelings in his spirit had been washed away, thus all that was left was complete astonishment.</span></p>

Furthermore, he also had Wang Qiu’er’s Destiny Skull and its skill Destiny’s Adjudication, which granted him immunity to three spiritual-type attacks per day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, the Evileye Tyrant King hadn’t been able to kill Huo Yuhao with its incredibly powerful attack because he’d used Destiny’s Adjudication to escape with his life. However, this force that was currently controlling his spirit had rendered him unable to resist at all. How powerful would his opponent have to be to achieve this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao wasn’t sure why this was happening, he could feel that whoever was doing this to him had to be an extremely powerful individual who didn’t harbor any ill intentions against him. Else, that person wouldn’t have placated his negative emotions.</span></p>
