 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw was incredibly sharp, but even it couldn’t break this crystal open. That flourishing and immense spiritual power was instantly withdrawn as the silver crystal shone and flickered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So hard!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao raised his Golden Dragon Spear with his left hand and poked at the silver crystal, but even the Spear did nothing to it. The silver crystal had a powerful spiritual barrier protecting it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since that’s the case, my Life Guardian Blade that’s good at consuming life energy probably can’t do anything to it, either. However, if your spiritual origin is hidden inside, do you really think there’s nothing I can do to you?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t trying to ruthlessly exterminate this Evileye Tyrant. The Evileye Tyrant’s body had been killed, but since a soul ring didn’t appear, it meant the soul beast wasn’t truly dead. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao really needed his seventh soul ring. His adversary was the one who had chased him down and attacked him first, and thus he didn’t feel his actions were inappropriate at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was possible that no one else in this world was as handy as Huo Yuhao when it came to dealing with spirits. Unfathomable incantations were voiced as a swathe of clean white flames gradually took form in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This small ball of fire had almost no warmth at all, but it gradually became material. The silver crystal, which wasn’t afraid of Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw or his Golden Dragon Spear before this, began to flicker vigorously after this white flame appeared. The Evileye Tyrant’s flustered and exasperated voice rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re dead if you dare to kill me! My father will avenge me, he will avenge me! If you let me go, I can guarantee you safe passage out of here! No, don’t do it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao seemed like he couldn’t hear its voice at all. His Darkgolden Terrorclaw held the silver crystal down, and the small cluster of white flames drifted onto the silver crystal just like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver-white crystal was so hard and tough, but sharp and shrill agonizing cries could be heard when this utterly unassuming white flame touched it. The tough silver crystal began to break apart like melting ice and snow, and silvery air streams could be seen emerging from within. However, none of it could escape the white flame, and every single wisp was absorbed and incinerated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were Purifying Flames, and this fire was specifically designed to purify spirits. Spirits would rise into the air after death, and if they didn’t dissipate by themselves, they were likely to become vengeful spirits. These Purifying Flames were the perfect medicine against vengeful spirits, and such spirits would be absolutely countered by Purifying Flames, no matter what rank they were. Huo Yuhao was probably the only person across the entire Douluo Continent who could release Purifying Flames directly. Furthermore, he could only channel Purifying Flames within such a short period of time after his spiritual power was raised to the concrete-material realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blood-red soul ring was finally released after the silver crystal melted completely. Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned as he stared at this soul ring’s light and subsequently pursed his lips tightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t in a hurry to absorb this soul ring. Instead, he used his Golden Dragon Spear to search the Evileye Tyrant’s carcass, and he quickly found a small and delicate silver skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion said, Evileye Tyrants almost always produced skull bones if they produced one because the soul beast’s whole body was basically just a head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao was preparing to put this skull bone away and bring it back to his companions, the Eye of Destiny on his forehead suddenly lit up. A rose-gold beam of light burst out and landed on the silver skull.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver skull was immediately covered with rose-golden hues before it flew towards Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny. The skull shrank rapidly as it was drawn through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt a dash of coldness in between his eyebrows as a rich and powerful wave of spiritual power flooded into his spiritual sea. In the next moment, this wave of spiritual power was cocooned by another even more domineering and overbearing existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And after that? The sensations just stopped...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s facial expression instantly became a little strange. The sensation he had just felt made him feel as though his Eye of Destiny had gobbled up the Evileye Tyrant’s skull!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No… it wasn’t gobbled up by my Eye of Destiny. It should have been eaten by Qiu’er’s Three-Eyed Golden Lion Skull Bone, right?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao suddenly recalled his impression when he had first met Wang Qiu’er, back when she was still the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. Back then, she seemed to consume other soul beasts’ brains as food, so did the skull bone that originated from her also eat other skull bones?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was going to happen after it ate them? Did this mean that part of Qiu’er’s consciousness remained?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao realized that some remnant of Wang Qiu’er’s consciousness might still remain, his heart began to heat up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he had yet to feel his skull bone when the Skydream Iceworm’s voice rang out in his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t stay here for long. Absorb the soul ring and leave!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes! He was deep in the Evildemon Forest, and there was nobody around to protect him. He couldn't stay here for long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao flipped his right wrist as he thought until this point, and a small, delicate soul tool appeared in his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This soul tool was blood-red and looked like it was sculpted and engraved from a special crystal body. There were countless sophisticated patterns on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pressed on the soul tool’s surface, and the entire spherical soul tool lit up as circle after circle of red light expanded outward. These circles quickly touched the blood-red soul ring hovering in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those red waves acted like they had instantly found a target, and wrapped themselves around the soul ring. Strangely, the blood-red soul ring was formless and had no substance, but it was actually pulled down by those red waves and was quickly absorbed into that small, delicate soul tool.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s so useful! Teacher Xuan is a truly a genius amongst geniuses.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao exclaimed in admiration inside before he leapt into the air and soared into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul tool that he had just used was called a soul ring storage tool. It wasn’t very big and was made from only the rarest metals. Xuan Ziwen had expressly crafted this soul tool for Huo Yuhao after he brought all those rare metals back from Radiant City. This soul tool was Class 8! It could use certain special undulations from its constituent metals under guidance from its formation arrays to temporarily store soul rings. It could store a maximum of nine soul rings at once, and these soul rings could be maintained and stored for one week.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This soul tool was far too expensive to craft en masse, a product of Xuan Ziwen’s research. Back then, Xuan Ziwen had used this research product to become the Illustrious Virtue Hall’s chief researcher. It was a pity that the materials that this soul tool needed were excessively expensive. Crafting this soul tool was also very difficult because it was a Class 8 soul tool. It was practical and useful, but its usefulness was still a far cry from how expensive crafting this soul tool was to many people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Ziwen was recognized for his research, but his research product wasn’t promoted or popularized within the Sun Moon Empire. Practically speaking, it couldn’t be promoted at all.</span></p>

Who killed my son? Who was it?!” This voice was purely projected as thought via spiritual power, and both humans and soul beasts could clearly feel the indignation, along with the voice’s unrivaled and terrifying spiritual power.&nbsp;</span></p>

A defeated hundred-thousand-year soul beast calling for its father… that was simply too laughable!&nbsp;</span></p>

In terms of obtaining soul rings, no other soul beast was more suitable for him than the one he had just used all his strength to kill. However, his luck was so “good” that it was unbelievable... the soul beast he had just killed was the youngest son of the Evildemon Forest’s true dictator, the Sun Moon Empire’s number one savage beast, and the entire Continent’s number two savage beast: the Evileye Tyrant King, who was also known as the Evil Emperor!&nbsp;</span></p>

The Evileye Tyrant’s spiritual origin was naturally obliterated after Huo Yuhao killed it, and even though the Evil Emperor was in a deep slumber, how could it not be startled awake when one of its children’s auras suddenly vanished? It was the reason the Evil Emperor had exclaimed so furiously.&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn’t dare to hold back anymore and activated everything he had as he flew forward with all his might.&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn’t know why his luck in recent days was so terrible. Even after Qiu’er’s auspicious Sacrifice, this fact didn’t change…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, now was obviously not the time for complaints and resentment. Huo Yuhao continued flying with every ounce of his strength as he unleashed all of his spiritual power. He activated Imitation and Spiritual Interference to their highest possible levels to mask himself. His fervent hope was that the Evil Emperor’s awakening required a process and that it couldn’t lock onto him as soon as it woke up!&nbsp;</span></p>
