 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 84.1: The Gold of Life</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was the one who had placed the opening bid.</p>
 <p>Everyone from Shrek Academy was shocked to hear Huo Yuhao bid for the item. People like Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi who didn’t really know about soul tools could get a sense of this carving knife's problem from Auctioneer Qing Ya’s explanation and the silence from the audience. Yet, Huo Yuhao had placed a bid without even consulting them about it. He…!</p>
 <p>“Junior brother, you…” Bei Bei frowned. His junior brother wasn’t an impulsive person from his understanding of the boy!</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao glanced at his senior brother with a slightly apologetic look in his eyes. He then leaned towards Wang Yan and said in a low voice, “Teacher Wang, I used my Spiritual Detection a moment ago, and determined the source of this Ominous Soul-Devouring carving knife’s problem. I’ve got a way to control the drawback from using it. Let’s bid for this first. If I’m not mistaken, this carving knife ought to have been forged from an extremely precious and mysterious metal called the Gold of Life. It just so happens that I can undo the remnants of the curse contained within the carving knife with my spiritual power and Ultimate Ice. There definitely won’t be a problem.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan frowned and said, “Yuhao, don’t be hasty. Your life and future is at stake! I can’t let anything happen to you.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao muttered irresolutely to himself for a bit before continuing, “Teacher Wang, why don’t you look at it this way: let’s bid for it first. If I can’t use the carving knife, I’ll get the Dean of the Soul Tool Department and Teacher Fan Yu to supervise me in undoing the curse on this soul-devouring carving knife when we get back to the academy. I will only use it on the condition that the curse has definitely been lifted. If not, I will give up and leave it to collect dust in the academy. I’ll definitely repay this sum of money to the academy in the future. Do we have a deal?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan felt a little reassured after hearing what Huo Yuhao said. The ranked carving knife was only going for a hundred thousand golden coins. If Huo Yuhao could really use the carving knife regardless of how problematic it was, then this was a huge steal!</p>
 <p>A ranked carving knife appearing in a first-rate auction was a rarity because soul tool engineers who owned a ranked carving knife would treat them as treasures. These ranked carving knives would be passed on from one generation to another; only wastrels would put it up for auction.The highest bid in history for a ranked carving knife had amounted to tens of millions of golden soul coins! That had been for a carving knife ranked in the top twenty.</p>
 <p>It wouldn’t be a bad thing to spend a hundred thousand golden soul coins if it meant the academy would have three ranked carving knives.</p>
 <p>When he thought to this point, Wang Yan nodded at Huo Yuhao. He had another reason for agreeing to this bid. How could anyone compare to Shrek Academy in terms of people with reputable backgrounds? They had a few especially powerful light-attribute soul masters. If Shrek Academy couldn’t control this murderous carving knife, then there was really no one in this world who could do so at present.</p>
 <p>Even though the creator of this carving knife was an evil soul master, he too was a Class 9 soul tool engineer. However, no existence wasn’t unparalleled in the face of Shrek Academy. Moreover, Wang Yan faintly had the impression that the Shrek Guardians seemed to have gone on a very important mission three thousand years ago. After paying a heavy price, they had managed to kill a powerful soul master.</p>
 <p>In any case, he had to follow through with it since Huo Yuhao had already bid for it!</p>
 <p>Qing Ya repeatedly questioned the audience, yet there was no response from them. No one was willing to bid for this murderous carving knife because they knew that once they bid for it, a deal would really be formed.</p>
 <p>“A hundred thousand golden soul coins, going once!” Qing Ya had no choice but to start the final call to close the auction.</p>
 <p>“A hundred thousand golden soul coins, going twice!”</p>
 <p>“A hundred thousand golden soul coins, going thrice! Sold!”</p>
 <p>The mallet fell with a bang, announcing that this exceptionally murderous carving knife now belonged to Shrek Academy. At the very least, it didn’t belong to Huo Yuhao yet.</p>
 <p>Seeing as he had won the bid for this soul-devouring carving knife, Huo Yuhao’s face was beaming with happiness as he heaved a huge sigh of relief. “Yuhao, what’s the Gold of Life?” He Caitou asked in a low voice.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hastily replied, “I read about it in an ancient text in the library. The Gold of Life is a special kind of metal that’s extremely rare. This metal appears to have a life, but doesn’t possess intelligence. It can seemingly break down all metals and ores known to man. It’s very rare. From what was written in the ancient text, the Gold of Life seems to hold tremendous power, but no one has completely grasp the means of using the Gold of Life to date.”</p>
 <p>He Caitou scratched his head and said, “It looks like I need to read more books. I didn’t even know that a treasure like this existed.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao sighed to himself. It was only natural that he hadn’t read about it from some ancient text. Something like the Gold of Life might not even belong to this world! This was because the description of this metal came from Calamity Necromancer Electrolux - the entity from another space that had helped him kill an evil soul master.</p>
 <p>When the soul-devouring carving knife countered Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power, the almighty beings in his mind sensed that his spiritual sea was in danger and woke up at the same time.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm was the most sensitive to changes in spiritual power, so he too was the first to awaken. He only looked at the soul-devouring carving knife and told Huo Yuhao he shouldn’t carelessly play around with it because a huge threat resided in that toy. The Ice Empress had other thoughts about this matter. In a slightly more disdainful manner, she commented that though this carving knife was cursed, Huo Yuhao had an Ultimate Ice armor. Added onto the fact that he had the Skydream Iceworm’s tremendous spiritual power, and the curse shouldn’t have too much of an effect on him. However, it only made sense if he couldn’t use this carving knife.</p>
 <p>As they were both arguing with each other, a sound of bewilderment came from Calamity Necromancer Electrolux. He hadn’t been surprised for who-knows-how long, but he was really astonished when he saw this carving knife.</p>
 <p>The words “the Gold of Life” then spilled from his lips.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao explained everything that Electrolux had told him to He Caitou.. The reason why Huo Yuhao had impulsively placed a bid without soliciting Wang Yan’s opinion on the matter was because Electrolux told him he definitely had to get this carving knife at all costs.</p>
 <p>However, Electrolux fell silent once the carving knife was in his hands. Huo Yuhao only sensed that the mysterious old man was actually pleasantly surprised, an emotion that was rare to him.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress both held somewhat of a restraining fear towards Electrolux. As such, they hadn’t opposed him yet. After all, Electrolux had previously proven his good intentions with actions. If it weren’t for him, Huo Yuhao might have died in the face of the Envoy of the Death God. The soul beasts believed in the creed that the strongest was deemed king. Electrolux had used his strength to show them how powerful he was, so they had no choice but to accept his existence.</p>
