<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Human-shaped soul tools were already quite developed. In the near future, the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empire’s fate would be sealed when ordinary soldiers could also use simplified soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little lost when he thought until here. Since he knew that everything was in vain, why was he still doing it? The continent was going to be dominated by soul tools in the future. This was the natural outcome as technology developed. Perhaps it wasn’t a bad thing for the continent to be unified. As long as the Sun Moon Empire was more restrained and passed down the good things of the original three empires, a unified empire wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he would feel very panicky when he thought of this. His own empire could potentially be wiped out. This was definitely not something that would be joyous to anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what the future was going to be like, he was going to do his best to protect his empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the Sun Moon Empire ruled the entire continent, he wouldn’t be around anymore. Furthermore, the Soul Tool Hall was still improving day by day. In addition, both the Dou Ling and Star Luo Empires were quickly developing their own soul tools. If they delayed the Sun Moon Empire’s unification of the continent, it might be possible for them to remove the threat that the Sun Moon Empire posed. When that happened, the continent would still remain divided. As more and more of their soul masters started using soul tools, the Dou Ling and Star Luo Empires might actually have an opportunity to counter the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was the ideal situation. After the Heavenly Soul Empire was wiped out, didn’t the Sun Moon Empire reorganize part of its soul masters?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not every soul master in the Heavenly Soul Empire had as much backbone as Du Busi. At least this wasn’t the situation now. If not, how could the Sun Moon Empire form a few more soul engineer legions out of nothing? Where did the soul engineers come from? Weren’t they just soul masters equipped with soul tools? Using soul tools wasn’t very difficult. A soul master could use soul tools after some simple training. It was not as if they were required to manufacture them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The overall strength of the Sun Moon Empire was still very great! Whether it was the Star Luo or Dou Ling Empire that was destroyed next, it would result in an irreversible outcome. Right now, the only hope they had was that internal problems would arise in the Sun Moon Empire. For example, Ju Zi’s suggestion was one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Xu Tianran could be killed, Ju Zi would give the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires ten years of buffer time. After ten years, who knew what the situation would be like? At least, Huo Yuhao could still reach Rank 98 within ten years and aim to become an Ultimate Douluo with three soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he really succeeded, no one knew how powerful he would be. Perhaps soul tools could no longer threaten him. If that was the case, everything would be different. Moreover, could he really not change an entire war with his individual ability once his fighting strength reached an extreme? For example, could he possibly abduct Ju Zi and her son? If internal problems kept arising in the Sun Moon Empire, perhaps the threat they posed could really be removed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought until here, Huo Yuhao felt more and more tortured. However, he started to understand why Du Busi was so proud that he chose to die instead. He really had no choice! His empire was on the brink of collapse. If he didn’t resort to such an extreme method, there was nothing he could change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, could Huo Yuhao really do the same? No, he couldn’t. Not even talking about anything else, he couldn’t even convince himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He also didn’t know how Xu Yunhan was right now. When he thought of how close both of them were earlier, Huo Yuhao felt much more relaxed. He had to have a few such kids with Tang Wutong in the future.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wutong is so pretty. Our kids should be very good-looking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he gently held onto Tang Wutong’s hand, he felt how delicate her small hand was. He felt a little passionate right now. His father-in-law, whom he had not met before, had finally let him off. The seal had been removed. It seemed like he could do more things now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, perhaps he might have been traumatized, or perhaps he treasured Wutong too much, but Huo Yuhao hadn’t done anything yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they entered the Heavenly Soul Empire’s borders, they inevitably ran into high altitude aerial surveillance soul tools drifting in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao would always have a fresh feeling when he saw these soul tools. This was because they were all modified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire never once relaxed on their research of soul tool technology. They kept on improving their soul tools. The pressure of war enabled them to fully understand the huge advantage that technology gave them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, these surveillance soul tools weren’t modified as rapidly as the improvements in Huo Yuhao’s abilities. They were unable to find traces of Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This plain terrain in the Heavenly Soul Empire was very level. To find an army in such a huge empire wasn’t easy. Huo Yuhao wasn’t very anxious either. He only led Tang Wutong around within the empire. Whenever they reached a city, they would enter to seek intelligence, as well as try the local delicacies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he wasn’t just drifting without any purpose. First, he moved along the side of the Heavenly Soul Empire that was close to the Dou Ling Empire’s borders. If the Sun Moon Empire wanted to attack the Dou Ling Empire, it had to station troops along this stretch. However, nothing like this happened. This meant that the Sun Moon Empire was unlikely to attack the Dou Ling Empire in the short-term. If it wasn’t the Dou Ling Empire, was it the Star Luo Empire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This discovery left Huo Yuhao very tense. Precisely because he was very familiar with Ju Zi, he was more aware that Ju Zi hated the Star Luo Empire! Her family members had perished during a clash between the Star Luo Empire and Sun Moon Empire. As a result, she would bring the war to the Star Luo Empire once she had the slightest chance to do so. The reason why she hadn’t targeted the Star Luo Empire earlier was because it was the strongest among the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. If the Sun Moon Empire dealt with the Star Luo Empire first, it would suffer much greater losses, especially if the Star Luo Empire had the support of Shrek Academy. If the Sun Moon Empire failed to take the Star Luo Empire down, it was also difficult to tell how greatly the Sun Moon Empire would be drained as the war went on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was a reputable general. Everyone knew this. Ju Zi also regarded him as her most formidable opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Currently, the Star Luo Empire still threatened the Sun Moon Empire with their control of the Ming Dou Mountain Range. They restrained part of the Sun Moon Empire’s forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was a very good time for the Sun Moon Empire to attack the Star Luo Empire right now. The Heavenly Soul Empire had already been wiped out and the Dou Ling Empire was facing internal chaos. They couldn’t even protect themselves, much less help the Star Luo Empire. Apart from Shrek Academy’s help, the Star Luo Empire didn’t have any other external reinforcements. In terms of strength, the Star Luo Empire was still inferior to the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he thought until here, Huo Yuhao hurriedly led Tang Wutong deeper into the Heavenly Soul Empire. He wanted to take a look at Heaven Dou City first before proceeding to the Star Luo Empire’s borders. If Ju Zi was really intent on attacking the Star Luo Empire, Huo Yuhao had to intervene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Huo Yuhao didn’t realize that his concern for the White Tiger Duke had exceeded his hate for him as time passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Dou City didn’t seem any different from how it was before. After it went through war, it was devastated for a period of time. However, it was soon rebuilt by the Sun Moon Empire. Not only did it regain its former look, but it was also becoming more and more prosperous after soul tools were introduced to the civilians in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had the illusion that this city hadn’t been through a war when he entered. The streets were bustling with activity, and everyone appeared to be very happy. It was as if the pain that this city had once been through had vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Civilians were really the easiest people to satisfy. As long as they didn’t go hungry, weren’t cold and had a roof above their heads, they were content. As for who their ruler was, they weren’t too bothered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed before gently shaking his head. He led Tang Wutong towards the imperial palace in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had once met the Darkness Holy Dragon Long Xiaoyao here and almost died. However, they weren’t so afraid of him now. The imperial palace was the best place for them to obtain any intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already unleashed his omnidirectional Spiritual Detection. With his current cultivation, his Spiritual Detection was sufficient to cover half the entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t many troops stationed in the city. After all, this was a landlocked city, and wasn’t the capital. It was just a huge city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire didn’t erect very strong defenses for the inner cities. It seemed like they didn’t remember how Huo Yuhao had once destroyed many of their cities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao had the idea of returning to lead his three soul engineer legions to cause trouble in the Sun Moon Empire once again, so that the Star Luo Empire and Dou Ling Empire had more time. However, it seemed like this idea was a little unrealistic right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The academy needed to be defended, and the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion was being sent to the Dou Ling Empire. As for the two other soul engineer legions, their situation wasn’t very clear. Given how intent the Sea God’s Pavilion was on protecting the academy, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t be allowed to use the soul engineer legions now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like he could only cause destruction on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The imperial palace was within sight. Huo Yuhao could sense more and more soldiers, as well as many surveillance soul tools inside the imperial palace scanning the outside. Some of these surveillance soul tools were even unfamiliar to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do we go in? Or what?” Tang Wutong softly asked Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
