 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 21.2: Fusion of the Three Innate Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p>“Oh…” The sloppy elder who was called Xuan Lao swallowed a mouthful of chicken before glancing back at Wang Yan. In all other aspects, he looked like a very old man. However, his unexpectedly scarlet eyes were extraordinarily bright; they seemed as if they could steal one’s soul away. But his gaze was slightly disorderly, so much so that he even appeared vacant; it was as if he wasn’t seriously paying attention to Wang Yan’s words.</p>
 <p>“A Body Soul, interesting.” Xuan Lao mumbled to himself, his voice somewhat rough and aged.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan asked, “Xuan Lao, can a hair martial soul be considered a Body Soul?”</p>
 <p>Xuan Lao spoke as he ate, “It could be connected to it.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan replied, “Since that’s the case, Lan Susu and Lan Luoluo should deserve your attention; they can even release a fusion skill. If they can even be connected to a Body Soul, their future potential should be quite large.”</p>
 <p>Xuan Lao shook his head and said, “Hair? Impossible. You’re known as a person whose research and theoretical skills are very strong, so how could your knowledge of Body Souls be so weak?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan smiled bitterly. “There’s simply no one I can perform research on! Also, the information related to Body Souls is simply too limited. The Body Sect hasn’t entered the world for a long time.”</p>
 <p>Xuan Lao chuckled and stood up, his wet feet stepping on the grassy floor. He appeared very casual and relaxed as he said, “Then let me teach you something. To tell how strong a Body Soul is, you have to see how important it is to the body. If the body part used in a Body Soul is more important to the human body, the better it’ll be. Because of that, I’m quite interested in that youth who has the Spirit Eyes. If your hair falls off, it can still be grown back. But what if you lose your eyes? Furthermore, he even possesses a spiritual-type martial soul. In other words, his martial soul actually consists of his eyes and his brain. To be able to see a Body Soul that stands at the peak of all Body Souls within your lifetime, you’re quite lucky. However, I believe that his Body Soul hasn’t been completely stimulated yet. Otherwise, why would he be reduced to using a ten-year soul ring? Go tell Little Ning I’ll be watching the freshmen assessment’s ranking tournament. Ask him to leave a space for me.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Night gradually descended. However, the ice-blue halo in Wang Dong’s and Huo Yuhao’s room continued to quietly flicker.</p>
 <p>Time gradually passed as evening became night. The aura surrounding Huo Yuhao’s and Wang Dong’s body had secretly undergone mysterious changes; the colors of their respective auras had further coiled around each other, fusing. Furthermore, their respective soul power had even travelled in a strange cycle after entering each other’s bodies. In addition to that, each differently colored aura was followed by a different circulation path.</p>
 <p>If it were anyone else who had entered a martial fusion, they would need at least three days to complete their fusion. However, the Skydream Iceworm’s help managed to help them directly complete the soul power circulation paths during their fusion by utilising the interactions between their auras, allowing them to save an extremely large amount of time.</p>
 <p>After a wordless night, day gradually arrived.</p>
 <p>The ice-blue cocoon gradually melted, revealing the situation within. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were still tightly hugging each other, but the differently colored auras surrounding them had already disappeared. Their faces were right next to each other, and they could even smell each other’s breath. They were sleeping very, very soundly.</p>
 <p>After coming to Shrek Academy, this was the first time that Huo Yuhao hadn’t woken up early to cultivate, as well as the first time he hadn’t eaten breakfast.</p>
 <p>The outside of the dormitory quickly became lively. The other students living in the dorms had already woken up, and they were rushing about to clean themselves.</p>
 <p>The noisy sounds gradually affected the two who were sleeping soundly, causing Wang Dong to wake first.</p>
 <p>“Ugh.” Wang Dong’s soft groan sounded somewhat lethargic, yet also seemed slightly delicate. As he slowly opened his eyes, he saw Huo Yuhao right next to him.</p>
 <p>He was left stunned for a moment. After moving his body for a moment, he realised that he’d been tightly hugged by Huo Yuhao; their chests were stuck to one another’s tightly. Huo Yuhao’s body even seemed to be giving off a warm feeling.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong only knew that he had slept for a very, very long time. He had never felt something like this before, so at this moment, besides a slight sense of peculiarity in his heart, he actually felt panicked.</p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao, wake up.” He struggled lightly against Huo Yuhao’s embrace, wanting to free himself from Huo Yuhao’s hands. However, staying in that position for too long a time had caused the two’s bodies to slightly stiffen up. Without even talking about Huo Yuhao’s hand, even his own hand felt slightly numb as he tried to pull them back to himself.</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Huo Yuhao finally woke up from his sleep, discovering Wang Dong, who was in front of him, with a glance. The two were simply too close to each other; the only reason why their noses weren’t stuck together was because Wang Dong had deliberately raised his head. But, Huo Yuhao felt the sensation of a long pair of eyelashes as Wang Dong blinked.</p>
 <p>“Why’re you so close to me?” Huo Yuhao spoke subconsciously. As he spoke, his warm breath covered Wang Dong’s face.</p>
 <p>“You…” Wang Dong flew into a rage. He suddenly started struggling, finally withdrawing his arms. Then, he used his hands to grab Huo Yuhao’s shoulders, pulling himself backwards while raising his soft legs and shoving them between him and Huo Yuhao, creating a gap between the two of them.</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao woke up, he subconsciously loosened his grip on Wang Dong’s hands. But after being separated from Wang Dong by his legs, he finally woke up from his sleep. However, Wang Dong woke him up even more in the next moment...</p>
 <p>Within the dorm room, the two each had a single bed to themselves. The sudden strength released by Wang Dong’s long legs immediately kicked Huo Yuhao away, causing him to land on the ground with a “putong”.</p>
 <p>“Aiya, Wang Dong, what’re you doing?” Huo Yuhao was in agony due to being fiercely kicked to the ground by Wang Dong while he’d been completely defenceless. This immediately caused an indignant expression to appear on his face.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was slightly breathless as he sat up. After straightening his messy clothes, he angrily said, “You’re asking me what I was doing? Why were you sleeping on my bed last night?”</p>
 <p>“Uh…” Only then did Huo Yuhao discover that he’d been kicked off Wang Dong’s bed. He remained silent for a brief moment, thinking to himself, “Bro, oh Bro, you’ve doomed me. Don’t you know how mysophobic that guy is? Why would you make me sleep together with him?”</p>
 <p>Although he thought this in his heart, he still argued, “You can’t blame me for this. Look, didn’t you sleep with me as well?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong snorted angrily. Just as he was about to reply to Huo Yuhao, a piercing ring suddenly rang out, jolting both of them.</p>
 <p>“I forgot, it’s time for class. Crap, we’re late. Quick.” Huo Yuhao instantly jumped up, directly running outside with Wang Dong in tow.</p>
