 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pulled Huo Yuhao with both her hands. She pulled so hard that he took a step forward. She was now in his embrace. Suddenly, both their bodies lit up, and their eight soul rings released a fascinating and unprecedentedly bright glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao disappeared. A huge vertical eye that was filled with gentleness and love appeared where he was previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eye of the Asura!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also disappeared, and turned into a giant but beautiful Radiant Butterfly Goddess. Her wings closed up and engulfed that vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the lights retracted instantly. When they shone again, everyone couldn’t help but squint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tri-colored beam made of blue, gold and jade-green light appeared. The vertical eye, which seemed so abstruse, as if it were another dimension on its own, shot out from this beam of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tri-colored beam of light shot a thousand meters into the sky before turning into a huge beam that seemed to support the entire sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the shore, Bei Bei was now in tears as he witnessed everything. He muttered to himself, “A Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! Wasn’t that tri-colored beam of light Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s fusion skill, A Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten years ago, they had used this powerful fusion skill to earn their reputation in Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten years later, this fusion skill revealed its true brilliance. It was more than a hundred times stronger. A sense of awe could be felt everywhere in the air. That beam of golden light seemed to have permanently imprinted itself on the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The huge vertical eye rose into the sky. Two projections lit up at either side of the vertical eye. On one side, there was the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, which was shining with diamond ice crystals and a jade-green glow. The other side was completely black. However, there was a weird golden pattern that flashed. It was the dense and heavy Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two projections instantly fused into the vertical eye. Suddenly, the vertical eye changed. A jade-green hammer surfaced as distorted lights shone. The hammer struck the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren’t any resounding sounds to be heard. However, the entire Shrek Academy shook slightly. A jade-green halo that spanned more than a hundred meters in diameter appeared in the sky. The inside of this halo was a deep, black and hollow hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it had hammered the sky until it cracked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was grabbing tightly onto Bei Bei’s shoulder. He was muttering word by word, “Blaze! Amidst! The! Frost! The! Heavenly! Emperor’s! Hammer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky cracked. The two sides of the hammer revealed different projections once again. One side was the rose-gold Eye of the Asura, while the other side was still the pitch-black Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both the Eye and the Clear Sky Hammer fused together. The originally jade-green hammer suddenly turned golden. Following this, it disintegrated. Countless small golden hammers flashed past within a region covering a thousand meters in diameter. Strong spiritual undulations caused everyone to feel stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan sobbed as she threw herself into Xu Sanshi’s arms. He Caitou’s voice trembled as he said, “Mantra Amidst the Void, Spiritual Tempest. She’s back. Dong’er is back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything soon returned to a peaceful state. The Ice Jade Empress and Radiant Butterfly Goddess silently surfaced. They gazed at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, they performed their last fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they fused, there was only a golden pattern left in the sky. Following this, a captivating leg walked out from the hole. A bright golden figure quietly appeared in the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was wearing an elegant golden dress. On her forehead, there was a vertical eye with sunray patterns. She was holding a long dragon pike in her left hand. In her right hand, there was golden trident that was filled with dominance, strength and elegance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her wavy pinkish-blue hair drooped behind her back all the way down to her feet. As she appeared, everything around her lost its gloss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle icy fog circled her body, and snowflakes started to dance in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost, Raiment of Light!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, she was back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei, He Caitou, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao were all very emotional at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all good friends with Wang Dong’er! When Wang Dong’er was still in a coma, Huo Yuhao was depressed. But how could they not be depressed too? They only avoided mentioning her name in front of Huo Yuhao because they were afraid of triggering his emotions further. However, this didn’t mean that they weren’t sad! It was just like how Huo Yuhao was also very worried about Tang Ya, and risked his life to save her. They were teammates, close friends, sworn friends and Shrek’s Seven Monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, they were all very emotional when they saw the familiar Golden Road, Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer, Spiritual Tempest and Raiment of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, they had known that Tang Wutong was here for the Blind Date. Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo also knew, but they didn’t tell Huo Yuhao beforehand. This was because they were afraid of making him feel conflicted. At the same time, they wanted to give him a surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, they couldn’t contain themselves when they saw what was happening, even though they had already predicted this long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Goddess of Light descended from the sky as she was surrounded by icy fog, dim golden light, and the ravishing and holy looks of the Goddess of Light, as well as the Eye of Destiny on her forehead. Even Yan Shaozhe was in awe, even though he was a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone could sense how strong the Goddess of Light was. This was the fusion of light and ice, and the best form that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er could adopt together. No, it should be the best form that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could adopt together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Goddess of Light gently landed on the icy surface. She scanned the entire place, and a slight smile appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, Huo Yuhao had controlled three of the four fusion skills that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er shared. Only this Goddess of Light was mainly controlled by Wang Dong’er. At the same time, this fusion skill was the most extreme out of the four fusion skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because the Goddess of Light possessed almost all the abilities that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er had. She combined their powers perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Goddess of Light had appeared once again. Right now, this Goddess of Light was the combination of the eight-ringed Huo Yuhao and eight-ringed Tang Wutong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A fusion skill which was a combination of the powers of two eight-ringed soul masters should be as strong as the abilities of a Titled Douluo. Currently, they were two of the strongest in the world of soul masters. As for how strong the Goddess of Light was, no one knew as of now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Goddess of Light lifted her head to look at the sky, revealing a complex look in her eyes. Following this, a gentle, golden glow rippled from her body. Everything seemed to turn illusory within this golden glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two figures separated from the Goddess of Light. Under the golden light, they turned back into Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four eyes met. Huo Yuhao was already in tears. A tall, big man was now crying like a child. Huo Yuhao had turned his yearning for Wang Dong’er into the Three Ultimate Haodong Skills. Right now, his yearning for Wang Dong’er had turned into love and tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t expected such a surprise today. This surprise enhanced his life and made him long for life. It was everything; it was the courage to carry on living, the will to pursue excellence and the confidence to reach for the godly realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wang Dong’er was in a coma, Huo Yuhao’s entire world had turned grey, but it was now colorful once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dong’er!” Huo Yuhao hugged her. He hugged her tightly, as if he wanted to make her a part of him. He only felt that his mind and heart were being enhanced right now. His soul power was surging, and their Haodong Power was unleashed the instant he hugged Tang Wutong. His passageways widened, and thick soul power undulations surrounded both him and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong lay in his embrace. Her arms circled around his waist and back. She gently said, “I’m Tang Wutong, not Dong’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not important. It’s not important right now.” Huo Yuhao said agitatedly. He wasn’t willing to let go of her anymore. He had found his love again. This feeling made him feel as if he had earned a new life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo looked at each other and smiled. The two of them said together, “A union has been made. Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong, congratulations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, thank you.” Huo Yuhao couldn’t say anything else right now. His heart was already filled by the person in his arms. He gently touched the icy surface with his toes and shot into the sky. In the next instant, he turned into a beam of golden light that disappeared deep into Sea God’s Island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only at this instant that everyone on Sea God’s Lake and the shore of Sea God’s Lake reacted. Although most people didn’t know what had happened, they saw what the result was. They saw that astonishing yet touching scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the atmosphere at the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date was raised to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t return to the Sea God’s Pavilion. He hugged Tang Wutong as he flew to the platform that they had fought on together before. This was the quietest place on the island right now. They wouldn’t be disturbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued to hug her tightly even as they landed. It was as if he really wanted to fuse her with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only now that Huo Yuhao felt that everything that had happened before was unreal. Yes, it was unreal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was nothing more appropriate than the Haodong Power to prove Tang Wutong’s identity. The Haodong Power only belonged to him and her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was much stronger than it was before, its origin was still the same. He was too familiar with this. He was too familiar.</span></p>
