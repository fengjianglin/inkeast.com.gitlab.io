 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao was still a little sloppy and his beard was still quite long when he flew back, there was no longer any ice or snow on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come in.” Tai Tan turned around and went back into the castle after he said these two words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly followed him. He could no longer keep calm. His heart was palpitating.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How exactly is Wutong?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know. It was time to determine his fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the castle, Tai Tan brought him to the main hall. He sat down himself, but didn’t invite Huo Yuhao to take a seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian was also around. He was silently seated in the main seat, and appeared even more gloomy than Tai Tan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong is not in good shape. Do you call this protecting her?” He said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart sank. He didn’t say anything, and only kneeled down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get up. What’s the point of having you here just to kneel down and kowtow to us? Even if you kneel for ten thousand years and become a turtle, will Wutong get better?” Tai Tan was furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “I only have this body of mine. I won’t harp on what I’ve done wrong. As long as I can save Wutong, I’m willing to do anything. If I can’t, I’ll go with her. We’ll go to another world, and I’ll protect her there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian’s facial muscles contorted. “Given a choice, I should have killed you the moment I saw you. At least we’d spare our darling so much pain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could only laugh bitterly. Niu Tian was right. If Tang Wutong didn’t follow him, she might not have suffered so much pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right now, there’s only one way.” Niu Tian suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Huo Yuhao was surprised as he looked at him. There was immediately an angry look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, you’ll need to make a sacrifice,” Niu Tian said calmly, “Are you willing to do so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am.” Huo Yuhao didn’t even ask what the sacrifice was. He agreed without any hesitation. He was even willing to give up his life for Tang Wutong. What more could he not do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian said, “Wutong’s body has been corroded by the aura of death. This aura of death has already fused with her spiritual sea, which is keeping her unconscious. The only way right now is for her to force this aura of death out from her body using her own strength. This is the only way she can recover. However, she’s not strong enough yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was confused as he asked, “What should we do then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian answered, “If I’m not wrong, you already have twin soul cores. Furthermore, they are Yin-Yang Complement twin soul cores. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao immediately nodded. At the same time, he was astonished. It was important to know that even Zhong Liwu couldn’t tell what his twin soul cores were, but this sect leader of the Clear Sky Sect could. Even with Huo Yuhao’s sharpness, he couldn’t tell how strong Niu Tian really was. Was it that Niu Tian was also an Ultimate Douluo? The only creature who could tell that he had Yin-Yang Complement soul cores was the Beast God, Di Tian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian said, “If we want Wutong to force the aura of death out from her body using her own strength, we need her to form twin soul cores too. They have to be formed using the Yin-Yang Complement too, so that she’ll stand a chance of survival. The soul cores will also dispel the aura of death naturally. Neither myself nor my second brother can do it. Our powers are different from Wutong’s. Our martial souls are also different. Only you can help her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have a special method in our sect which allows one to temporarily project his soul core into the body of another party. From there, one can help the other party to circulate their soul power. However, the only requirement is that both parties need to have extremely compatible soul power. Wutong’s soul core is also light-type. It’s also her Radiant Butterfly Goddess soul power. There’s only one way for her to most easily form her second soul core right now, which is through spiritual power. Your spiritual power is sufficiently strong too. This is why we need you to project your spiritual soul core into her spiritual sea and help her form her second soul core. From there, you can complete the formation using the Yin-Yang Complement. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are there any risks?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. The thing about this method is that it helps the other party, but it harms yourself. Wutong isn’t in much danger. As long as you are determined enough, the probability of success will be high. However, you might lose your soul core in the process. You might even hurt your origin because of the internal damage to your soul cores. The worst result is that you’ll become an idiot. Even if you don’t, your powers will fall greatly. You might not ever become a Titled Douluo in the future.” Niu Tian said. “This is why you should consider it very carefully. Once we begin, it’s going to be very difficult to stop. Stopping it will instantly endanger Wutong’s life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stood up and shook his head. “There’s no need to consider anymore. Let’s begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan said, “You must think it through carefully. Any injuries will be irreversible. Your twin soul cores are bound to be affected. According to my knowledge, you are the first human in history to complete the formation of Yin-Yang Complement twin soul cores. It’s likely that no one will follow in your footsteps either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uncle Tai Tan, Uncle Niu Tian, let’s stop wasting time. If we delay any further, Wutong’s body will be corroded even more by the aura of death. Let’s begin now. As long as we can make Wutong better, I can even give you my life. Let’s not even talk about lowering my cultivation. However, I have something that I need both your help with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian said, “Tell me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a determined look in Huo Yuhao’s eyes, “If I become an idiot in the process, please kill me immediately before dumping my corpse. We don’t need Wutong to see me in that state. Just tell her that I left her after sending her here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan was curious. “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered, “With her temperament, she’ll want to take care of me forever if I become an idiot. She’ll never be happy or blissful ever again. She’ll be hurt if she knows I left. However, her pain will lessen over time. But she must never know I’m dead. Otherwise, it’ll only backfire. This is why I hope both of you can grant me this wish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Niu Tian and Tai Tan looked at him with a gentler expression on their faces. Niu Tian nodded and said, “Alright, I promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Let’s begin then. Is there food to eat? I want to grab a bite and take a rest first so that I’ll be in my best state. I must help Wutong recover.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan said, “Let me bring you some food.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao ate scrumptiously and didn’t bother about taste at all. Right now, he only saw food as a way to replenish his energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After eating, he meditated a little. After two hours, he finally re-appeared in front of Tai Tan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian had disappeared somewhere. Once again, Tai Tan asked Huo Yuhao whether he was regretful. After receiving a determined answer, he led Huo Yuhao to the top of the castle. They only stopped when they reached the top floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only one room at the top. There were four windows around the room. The sea of clouds outside the castle could be clearly seen from this room. As the clouds drifted in the sky, it felt as if this was some kind of immortal realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was quietly lying down at the center of a large bed. She appeared very peaceful, as if she was in a deep sleep. But she looked very pale, and there was even an aura of death surrounding her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Death God Demonpuppet’s attack was simply too strong. It was a miracle that she had actually survived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s face immediately contorted when he saw her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was Wang Dong’er or Tang Wutong, they had both suffered a lot for him. Even Huo Yuhao didn’t know how he could face Wang Dong’er or Tang Wutong. If this carried on, he might actually go crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a man, instead of protecting his own woman, he let her get critically hurt because of him. Such a feeling was very consuming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in such pain. When he heard of this method to save Tang Wutong, he actually felt relieved in his heart. It was as if he had been freed from restraints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So what if he had to sacrifice his abilities for her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned his head to look at Tai Tan, “Uncle Tai Tan, how do we start?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan said, “Sit opposite Wutong. I’ll lift her up. Your palms must touch. Then, I’ll give you instructions on what to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao gave Tai Tan a hand in lifting Tang Wutong. They placed her in a seated position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her head drooped, and her pinkish-blue hair flowed down. Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but tear up when he saw like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As their palms touched, his palms shook slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cleanse your mind of impurities. Otherwise, you’ll harm both her and yourself.” Tai Tan’s voice sounded in Huo Yuhao’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was immediately alarmed. He hurriedly focused and stabilized himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan said, “Pour your soul power into Wutong’s body slowly. Entangle your soul power with hers. After we control the aura of death and restrain it, it’ll be less chaotic, even though the resistance will be even stronger. Once you fuse your soul power into her, the aura of death will certainly circulate into your body through your soul power. If you want to complete this method, you must possess an aura of death too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao circulated his soul power and slowly fused it with the aura of death in Tang Wutong’s body. The entire fusion process was very slow. The aura of death wasn’t very domineering. While it flowed into Huo Yuhao’s body, it wasn’t doing so very smoothly. This was because Huo Yuhao’s twin soul cores were simply too strong. His soul power was shaped like a whirlpool. Once the aura of death entered his body, it was immediately swept away.</span></p>
