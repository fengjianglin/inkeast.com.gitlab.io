 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, a golden light was automatically released at this instant. It seemed like the Wildlion Douluo was actually in possession of an invincible barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, invincible barriers were not that useful in battles between Titled Douluo. His invincible barrier was shattered almost instantly by the black and white sword lights. After shattering the barrier, the remaining streaks of sword light landed on the Wildlion Douluo, whose soul skill had been interrupted earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wildlion Douluo grunted as a wound formed across his chest. He was fortunate enough to possess a fairly strong amount of soul power and an invincible barrier. If not, he would have suffered a far more serious injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this instant, the Angel Douluo, Ye Guyi, was already in berserk mode. She released another layer of brilliant golden light, which started to expand from her body into her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It looked like she was establishing a gigantic golden barrier around her peers. This was because Xue Kui, Xue Leng, and the soul masters they had brought along with them had released their ranged soul skills while she was fighting the Wildlion Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though these soul skills were not particularly strong individually, their powers became significant when combined! It was still fairly threatening when so many people were to launch an attack at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, Ye Guyi had no choice but to establish some defensive measures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All surrounding ranged attacks were immediately reflected the moment they came into contact with her golden light. When the golden light eventually gave way, all the remaining attacks were either deflected or blocked by the last ounce of power within the golden barrier. Even the two gigantic pillars released by the Titled Douluo at the side were slowed by the barrier before they landed on Xu Sanshi’s Shield Wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, a loud thud could be heard as the Shield Wall shook vigorously. Xu Sanshi let out a grunt, but he ultimately managed to block the gigantic beams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like the group had managed to hold off the first combined attacks from their opponents with the collective defensive powers of Xu Sanshi and Ye Guyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, Ye Guyi had only just started. Just now, the barrier she had released was her own soul skill—Holy Light Spiritual Formation. Following which, her entire body took on a brilliant golden color. As the golden light intensified, she looked as though she had been carved out of pure gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the wings behind her back had also taken on the same color. This was her seventh soul skill—Angel True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, it seemed as though the Holy Angel had just descended from the World of the Gods. Her powerful holy aura was released into her surroundings, and her opponents could immediately feel an immense pressure from her aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, her eighth soul ring lit up. A golden figure instantly split from her body, and at the next instant, it had appeared behind the Wildlion Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being interrupted by Ye Guyi’s soul skill, the Wildlion Douluo was trying to unleash his seventh soul skill—his martial soul true body. However, he found himself immobilized the minute the golden angel appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wildlion Douluo felt as though his entire soul had been locked in position at that instant. He tried his best to resist that mysterious force. However, he was unable to break free from it. Following which, the golden image fused directly into the Wildlion Douluo’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very instant, the Wildlion Douluo’s body turned golden. As he breathed in and out, golden streaks of air were released from his nostrils and mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone who was standing by the Wildlion Douluo was scared out of their wits by this frightening sight. At this instant, a streak of matte black sword light flashed across the crowd. It seemed as though the surrounding space was frozen at that moment. Following which, everyone could hear a cry from a Soul Douluo. When they turned around to see what had happened to him, they saw that his body had been sliced in two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the battlefield, the sword fanatic, with his frightening sword intent, was always the person with the strongest attacking power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen had drawn first blood when he released his explosive fighting power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Xue Kui and Xue Leng had retreated from them, they could not help be shocked by how Xu Sanshi’s friend was able to kill their soul masters even after being surrounded by so many powerful soul masters. At that moment, they truly understood what it meant to be a graduate of Shrek Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, they had learned from their investigation that Xu Sanshi was one of this generation’s Shrek’s Seven Monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After successfully slaying someone with a single blow, Ji Juechen slashed his Judgement Sword outwards again. Even though he did not manage to kill someone this time, he was able to force a good number of them backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the intense battle unfolded, the Wildlion Douluo suddenly released a loud howl. His body suddenly released a blast of golden light. It was almost as if his soul had been stripped from his body. His pupils turned completely white as his body vibrated intensely. Huge amounts of fire-type soul power were spurting out from his pores before blood started to flow out from everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Titled Douluo was actually unable to defend himself after being hit by this soul skill. This was simply unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single soul master was stunned after seeing what had happened to the Wildlion Douluo. They could only tell that it was a result of Ye Guyi’s eighth soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Angel of Death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Wildlion Douluo had released all of the golden energy from his body, he started to burn in the golden light, which had transformed into a gigantic beam of light. The beam surged up into the sky as the Wildlion Douluo screamed in the burning light. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to escape from the light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi released another wave of Holy Light Spiritual Formation to negate the bulk of the attacks being launched at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Ye Guyi released an explosive amount of golden light again. Pairs of golden wings spread themselves one after another on her martial soul true body as her ninth soul ring lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Xue Leng and Xue Kui started to become genuinely frightened.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She’s just too scary! Why does she have so much power when she seems to be only twenty years old? What kind of ability is she unleashing? Her eighth soul skill was already enough to destroy a Titled Douluo. What would happen if she unleashes her ninth soul skill?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi’s six pairs of wings doubled instantly as they increased from the original six pairs to twelve pairs. Her aura continued to surge until it reached a frightening level of power. Even though she was releasing the same Holy Light Spiritual Formation, the soul masters with seven or eight rings were no longer able to damage her light barrier with their collective attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her frightening abilities had already exceeded what these Dou Ling Empire soul masters could have imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, Xue Kui and Xue Leng had actually done proper research on Xu Sanshi and his peers before they had begun their operation. They believed they had a decent understanding of their abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they had not expected this group of youthful individuals, whose oldest person was at most thirty years old, to be so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were especially shocked by Ye Guyi, because they did not expect her to be the strongest individual amongst the group. &nbsp;In fact, they did not even know that she was a Titled Douluo—much less a Titled Douluo who was so powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Ye Guyi had twelve pair of wings, what did that mean? It meant that she was now an Archangel! She was no longer mortal, and had developed God-like powers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Ye Guyi’s ninth soul skill was called Archangel’s Descent, which was also known as the God of Angels!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An insane amount of golden light was released from her body. She could only unleash and maintain this soul skill for ten seconds. However, she was able to wield power which could almost rival an Ultimate Douluo during those ten seconds. When she eventually became a Transcendent Douluo, the duration would be extended to thirty seconds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though one would not be able to do much in ten seconds, it was definitely sufficient to kill a good number of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Holy Sword appeared in the Archangel’s hand, Ye Guyi slashed the sword forward as streaks of holy light rippled into her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two Titled Douluo at the side who were wielding their poles received the most damage from the holy light. They could only try their best to use their martial soul true bodies to counter the holy light that shone onto them. By fusing into their long poles, they fought with their lives to counter the prowess of the Holy Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the holy light ended, only half of their long poles remained intact. The other half had been completely destroyed by the holy light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, there were more than six soul masters who were completely purified by the holy light. The Titled Douluo at their rear was also knocked away by the powerful light from the Holy Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They would never have expected one person’s explosive attack to be so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Run now!” Xu Sanshi exclaimed. Following which, a golden light flashed, and he swapped positions. When he reappeared, he was standing beside Xue Kui. On the other hand, Xue Leng had been displaced to where Xu Sanshi was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan was already waiting for Xue Leng to appear. She immediately put Xue Leng in a lock before smashing him into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi’s Xuanwu Shield collided heavily with Xue Kui. Even though Xue Kui was able to muster his soul power in time, he was still slammed outwards. His entire body in a numb state after being affected by the Mysterious Underworld Quake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi let out a warcry as he unleashed the power of his Golden Tortoise. He slammed the Xuanwu Shield in his hand into the ground as huge black ripples spread outwards within his Xuanwu’s Domain. The remaining soul masters immediately found themselves stumbling about on the rapidly shaking ground within the Xuanwu’s Domain.</span></p>
