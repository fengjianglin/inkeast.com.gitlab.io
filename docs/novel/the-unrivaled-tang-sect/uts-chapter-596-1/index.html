 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned as he looked at Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s clearly bursting with energy. However, why is he just like teacher just before he passed away? What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was also a little stunned as she looked at Long Xiaoyao, “Xiaoyao, are you fine? Are your injuries okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head and replied, “This small wound is nothing. I’m fine, Yuhao. Both of you are also here to deal with the Sun Moon Empire’s army, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. There was nothing for him to hide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled and turned his head to look at Ye Xishui. “Xishui, I can’t help you if you want to harm these two kids. I owe Mu En too much. It’s just like how I owe you. That’s why I can’t harm his disciples.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Mu En’s name, Ye Xishui’s entire body shook. Her originally sinister and cold-looking eyes revealed an extremely complex look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She squinted and turned to Huo Yuhao. “This is the second time. There’s no third time. When I see both of you again, I’ll definitely kill you. Xiaoyao, let’s go.” As she spoke, she had already leapt up. After this, she flew into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao didn’t immediately chase after Ye Xishui. Tnstead, he looked at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong with a gentle look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Both of you have set a precedent in human history. However, don’t be too arrogant. There’s still a long way to go. Though both of you do have some abilities, there are many types of destructive forces in this world. You’ll need to face them in the future. That’s why you should take the time to cultivate more. Yuhao, when you reach Rank 98, come find me at Radiant City. There’s something your teacher has left for both of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Long Xiaoyao stood up and retrieved a black crystal stone before passing it to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As long as you are in Radiant City, use your soul power to activate this stone. I’ll find where you are and come to you. I’m leaving now. Xishui is only here to vent her anger. Given her identity, she wouldn’t keep attacking the Sun Moon Empire’s army. After all, the Holy Ghost Church’s base is still in the Sun Moon Empire. I don’t know what she’s going to do next. Both of you must be extra careful. Since she said that she’ll deal with both of you the next time, she’ll not go back on her words. Furthermore, both the Sun Moon Empire and Holy Ghost Church are determined to get rid of both of you, especially you, Yuhao. Your presence has already made Shrek Academy much brighter than it’s supposed to be. That’s why you must be prudent and careful no matter when.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for your concern, elder.” Huo Yuhao respectfully bowed to Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao waved his hands. A sorrowful look suddenly appeared in his eyes. He sighed before he drifted up and chased after Ye Xishui. He instantly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stuck out her tongue as she watched him leave. She said, “These Ultimate Douluo are indeed very strong! We’re still very lousy compared to them. What Elder Long is hinting is that we’ve become a little inflated after we’ve become Transcendent Douluo. At times, it’s better if we cultivate. Come on, let’s start now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little annoyed. “There’s such a beautiful view here, but we’re going to cultivate. Won’t it dampen our mood?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong chuckled and said, “When we first entered the academy, who was the one who cultivated tirelessly and was unwilling to waste even a second? Don’t tell me you are becoming lazy? We have a heavy responsibility on our shoulders. I’ll carry half for you in the future, but you’ll still need to carry the other half. Come on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” Huo Yuhao leaped towards Tang Wutong immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purplish-gold lights suddenly flashed, and a huge dragon head blocked him off. Huo Yuhao screamed tragically and flew more than ten meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What, what are you doing?” He lay on the ground, extending his limbs and complaining to Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong revealed a sly look on her face. “My father’s seals don’t seem to be fully gone. That’s why…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After half a minute, both of them sat cross-legged on the grass. Their palms were clasped together and they entered cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was their first cultivation together ever since they became Transcendent Douluo, and after Tang Wutong formed her second soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After their Haodong Power formed once again, they were able to cultivate using their martial soul fusion again. Before, they had used such a method to grow stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The interaction of their soul power in a fight and during their cultivation was completely different. Huo Yuhao’s whirlpool-like soul power poured into Tang Wutong’s left hand through his right hand, and Tang Wutong’s whirlpool-like soul power poured into Huo Yuhao’s right hand from her left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When their soul power poured into each other’s bodies, their bodies shook, and bright lights shone from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden sun and blue moon, as well as another golden sun and purplish moon, appeared at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden suns were slowly getting closer to each other above their heads. After this, they fused together, and immense spiritual energy shot into the sky. A beam of strong golden sunlight tore the night sky apart. It was like a bright golden beam that held the sky together. The blue and purplish moons also shone brightly. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s bodies started to become clear and transparent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was even clear that four soul cores were rapidly revolving inside their bodies. The whirlpool-like soul power in their bodies kept on circulating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue and purplish moons slowly drifted in between both of them, while the suns were above them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two moons fused together just like that. The moonlight turned bluish-purple, and it was very bright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the air, origin energy of heaven and earth surged towards their bodies. After surging into their bodies, it was crushed and filtered before it fused with their soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a day, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s soul power had completely transformed. It felt brand-new to them now. It shone with a strange glow, which was a combination of blue, purple and gold. Those three colors intersected with one another to produce a strange yet dazzling radiance. After this fusion, their soul power was also a few times stronger than it was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every whirlpool had a strong suction force, absorbing the origin energy of heaven and earth into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Should we run?” Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong opened their arms at the same time. After this, they both held onto each other’s hands and concealed themselves in the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had no choice but to flee! They were so close to the Sun Moon Empire’s army. Who would have expected them to create so much noise just by cultivating? What were they waiting for if they didn’t flee? At least they had to find a cave before they could cultivate again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their Haodong Power was still joined, but what they found weird was that their soul power retained its original state. Their whirlpool-like soul power was still very strong. It was the result of their enhancement, however, the radiance that had appeared during their cultivation earlier had disappeared. The suction of air had also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on?” Tang Wutong asked Huo Yuhao. They were telepathically connected. Huo Yuhao naturally knew what she was asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know either.” Huo Yuhao was a little helpless as he answered, “Don’t tell me that the soul power we generated during our cultivation is already beyond the restraints of this world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head and said, “I don’t think so. It might have been so before. However, it’s clear that our abilities are still too weak after I witnessed the Darkness Holy Dragon’s power earlier. I believe our fused soul power is barely at the realm of an Ultimate Douluo. I don’t believe it has exceeded the restraints of this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I don’t understand what’s going on either. The only explanation I can think of is that our fusion is only perfect only if it’s completely silent. We can’t use that radiant whirlpool-like soul power to fight. It’s only an alternative method for us to restore our soul power. Let’s try more. Even if we can’t use it to fight, it’s still not bad to increase our recovery speed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them flew very far away and found a dense forest to hide in. Tang Wutong blew open a cave with her dominant aura, and both of them went inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were very excited by this new discovery. They were still quite traumatized after they were subjected to pressure by the two Ultimate Douluo earlier. Their thirst for power appeared once again. This time, it was unprecedentedly strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used a few branches to cover the opening of the cave, to prevent any light from shining out. In a short while, a small cave took form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hands as they stood in the cave. “Let’s our focus our energy and try again. Let’s see whether we can enter that state while standing up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Tang Wutong nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their hands were connected once again. Their soul power circulated in their bodies.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference from before was that their fusion was more rapid this time. Furthermore, a dazzling, spinning halo appeared around them after this fusion. Both of them felt that their soul power was being restored very quickly. It then started to slowly increase after reaching the peak of their restoration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While ‘slow’ was a subjective term, it had to be noted that it was very difficult for Transcendent Douluo to increase their abilities through cultivation. However, their soul power was slowly climbing. This meant that they could cultivate their abilities in such a state. Their cultivation speed was even faster than most ordinary Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
