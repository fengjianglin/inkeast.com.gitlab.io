 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Instead, up front was the tall and burly man called Qiu Yi. His complexion was very tan, and he was more than two meters tall. From the looks of it, he weighed at least a hundred and fifty kilos. His muscular arms were even thicker than Wang Qiu’er’s waist. As he stood there, he looked like a human bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hongchen siblings were standing behind Qiu Yi. Behind the two of them were Lan Xiu and Ye Nongfeng. Ding Xiaobu was the furthest back. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy formed a very weird rhombus-shaped formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A triangular formation versus a rhombus formation. The auras of both teams were already in a state of mutual hostility even before they started fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both parties, please get ready.” For some reason, Zheng Zhan started to feel very nervous. However, he was also very excited too. This fight had to be the pinnacle of clashes in the younger generation. As the referee, he was also eager to see who would win.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er lifted her right hand and the Golden Dragon Spear appeared in her palm. After that, she leapt forward and pulled her right hand back. She seemed like she was going to fling her spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Qiu Yi felt his goosebumps rising when Wang Qiu’er did this. He roared as he thought about how Wang Qiu’er was going to tear him apart. His hands clasped in front of him, and a huge circular shield appeared in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This circular shield was silvery-white. It had a protruding circle in the middle, and there were flowery patterns all over it. These patterns released gentle soul power undulations. In the center of the shield was a silvery-white gem as large as two fists clasped together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he unleashed this shield, a wave of silver light shone from the gem as Qiu Yi poured his soul power into it. This silver light engulfed the entire shield, and even all his teammates behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, an icy-blue halo could be seen extending from Qiu Yi’s feet. This halo started to spread until it covered the entire stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er wasn’t just striking a pose. However, she didn’t accumulate her power this time. In the next instant, her spear turned into a streak of golden light that shot straight towards Qiu Yi. A piercing sound reverberated throughout the entire stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She unleashed her weapon the moment the fight started. What strategy was that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She followed her spear. Wang Qiu’er touched her toes to the ground and burst forward like a bolt of lightning. Intense golden soul power was released from her body. Her first and second soul rings lit up, and dragon scales covered her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her teammates weren’t slow, either. First, four streaks of lights landed on Wang Qiu’er’s body simultaneously, which caused her to shine even brighter. Shrek’s team had Ning Tian, who possessed the Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda,the best auxiliary-type martial soul in the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was controlling four enhancements at the same time, it was her limit. With her support, Wang Qiu’er’s aura surged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin, Zhu Lu, Lan Susu, and Lan Luoluo also burst forward at the same time. They divided themselves into two groups and lined up behind Wang Qiu’er. Ning Tian’s right palm was extended to one side of her body. Her Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda started to shine, and streaks of flowing light shot out of her hands. A bright silver shuttle &nbsp;around two meters long appeared in front of her. As she stepped onto it, she drifted up a few feet and followed the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cao Jinxuan also unleashed his martial soul. The magical Time-Elapsing Clock shone brightly behind him. However, he didn’t use any soul skills at this point. His gaze was focused on the entire stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the golden light shot forward, Qiu Yi shouted and used his shield to block.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dang!...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light was deflected with a loud ringing sound, and returned instantly to Wang Qiu’er’s hand. Qiu Yi took two steps back as the shield in his hand was struck by the spear, rippling with intense undulations of silver light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qiu Yi was only a five-ringed Soul King and Class 5 soul engineer, and his shield was a Class 6 soul tool. Among Class 6 defensive-type soul tools, it was one of the best, and qutie rare. It was a foot thick, and weighed more than five hundred kilos. Even so, it suffered under Wang Qiu’er’s spear, showing how strong Wang Qiu’er was. It was very difficult to imagine that she possessed such great strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Sun Moon team started to retaliate at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The icy-blue halo spread further and further. It was the lethal poison of the Vermilion Clear Icetoad! Once this lethal poison spread, Shrek’s fighting abilities were bound to be greatly depleted even if the fight couldn’t be immediately ended. It was one of the most lethal weapons that the Sun Moon team could use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Icetoad Venom and Ice Venom Ring. The two teams had already covered more than half the distance between them as Meng Hongchen deployed her soul skills to their fullest. Wang Qiu’er was the first to charge into the world of poison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only that, but nine balls of silver light also rose behind Qiu Yi’s back. These nine balls of light drifted up into the air and formed an arc. Following this, nine streaks of silver light shot out at the same time. They wove a web of light in the air, blocking Wang Qiu’er’s path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Spear swept out and clashed against the silver web. However, something strange occurred. Wang Qiu’er’s strength lost its effect for the first time. She was struck back by a strong rebound force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the Hongchen siblings, Lan Xiu’s eyes shone with silver light, and her hands were moving rhythmically. The nine balls of silver light revealed they were nine silvery metal balls, each of them as large as a human’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Xiu was the Sun Moon team’s main control-type soul master. This was also why Xiao Hongchen was very respectful towards him. A control-type soul engineer was very rare among soul engineers, but Lan Xiu chose this weird cultivation method for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These nine balls of silver light were called the Nine Glories. Before he started learning soul tools, he was already using the Nine Glories. Initially, they were created for him by his father. However, they were only a set of Class 2 soul tools back then. Lan Xiu had continuously perfected them using his talents and practiced his control of them. It must be said that he could only create such soul tools even though he was a soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Glories were actually nine separate soul tools. They belonged to a category of soul tools called deflective rays. These rays were special special light waves. They could deflect any type of attack. At the same time, controlling nine soul tools at the same time wasn’t an easy feat. In addition, they had to be coordinated with one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Xiu was a rare spiritual-type soul master. However, his spiritual power was very pure, and couldn’t be unleashed through an intermediary like Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes. Without his soul engineering profession, he might even be unable to fight anyone. No one would have bothered to nurture him, either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, things were different now. Based on his extraordinary spiritual power, he had displayed an extraordinary talent in using and controlling soul tools since he was young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The nine streaks of silver light intersected in the air and seemed to form a barrier that resisted Shrek's first wave of attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll hold Wang Qiu’er. Go and settle the rest!” Lan Xiu shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Wang Qiu’er was struck back, she lifted her head to look at the nine balls of silver light. She raised her Golden Dragon Spear once again. This time, she aimed at the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Glories were also experiencing rapid changes in the air. The nine metal balls gathered together, and nine streaks of silver light shot out, forming a clump of silver light that came crashing down towards Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er flung her Golden Dragon Spear out, but it was deflected back by the clump of silver light. Following this, Wang Qiu’er punched out with all her strength and struck the clump of silver light. It was destroyed, but she was also forced back more than ten meters. Her distance to the Sun Moon team increased.</span></p>
