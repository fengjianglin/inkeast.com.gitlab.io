There were three Class 9 soul engineers among them, and the remaining four were Class 8. As the seven of them appeared together, they seemed very imposing.</span></p>

These carving tables were each twice as big as the carving tables used in the previous rounds. At this point, the members from the three organizations were setting up the equipment and rare metals that they had brought along.</span></p>

Every instrument and tool was exquisite! With all this, his speed and precision would be greatly increased. Furthermore, it might even be possible for him to create a soul tool beyond his class!</span></p>

In the grand final, they weren’t going to hold back anymore. On the one hand, they could test their abilities. On the other, they wanted the lucrative rewards.</span></p>

Such things couldn’t be bought with money. Moreover, they would also win a ton of rare metals. Huo Yuhao was more attracted to things he didn’t know about. If He Caitou was given the opportunity to do some research with all these things, he might be able to invent new soul tools!</span></p>

As the three parties prepare their equipment for the tournament later, we’ll let our seven judges safeguard our grand final prize. This prize has been prepared for our winner tonight. Let’s invite our chief judge for tonight – Class 9 soul engineer and the Starsky Douluo Ye Yulin – to present our grand final prize!”</span></p>

He lifted his right hand, and a spot of silver light shot into the sky.</span></p>

However, it grew in size as it ascended. When it was a hundred meters in the air, it actually turned into a bright ball of silver light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Starsky Douluo Ye Yulin? Huo Yuhao was stunned.</span></p>

In terms of soul tool creation, he was a genius. He was comparable to Jing Hongchen, and specialized in creating all types of high-altitude soul tools, which was how he had gotten his title.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou’s Eye of Fear was invented by this man. It was rumored that his soul tools could turn into stars during a war, unleashing great offensive strength. He could even tap into celestial phenomena to attack. His namesake soul tool was called the Sunmoon Divine Needle. It was ranked as having among the highest levels of offensive power of all Class 9 soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ball of silver light in the sky finally stabilized. Following this, a silver ray descended from the sky and landed on Ye Yulin. He didn’t make a sound, but mimicked a lifting action. Suddenly, a dim golden ball of light appeared within the silver ray of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ball had a diameter of one meter. As it slowly rose, it resembled a sun, shining along with the ball of silver light until it arrived next to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two balls of light coordinated with each other in the sky, revolving around an invisible center. They wove into a larger golden-silver ball up in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no strong aura from these two balls of light. However, all the Class 8 and above soul engineers that were familiar with the Starsky Douluo were shocked when they saw them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our revered Master Ye, can you introduce this prize to all of us?” In the face of Ye Yulin, Lu Qi appeared very respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin was an elder with a bald head. His cheeks were rosy, and his gaze was electrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lifted his head and was a little reluctant as he looked at the gold and silver ball of light. He said, “Tonight’s grand final prize is a soul tool that I created. I call it the Sunmoon Divine Needle. The reason behind this name is because it is an anchor for the Sun Moon Empire. It’s able to make up for the flaw of my Sun Divine Needle, which only works in the day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is an offensive-type soul tool. It can rise sixteen hundred meters into the air, and has an effective range of thirty kilometers. With sufficient spiritual power, it can detect a target up to thirty kilometers away, and produce an accurate attack. However, I’d like to caution all our young competitors, this soul tool is my proudest work. I hope you don’t tarnish it!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“At the same time, please do not dismantle it in an attempt to study it. Otherwise, you’ll only suffer from its backlash...”</span></p>

A Class 9 soul tool with an effective range of thirty kilometers! It could also unleash immense spiritual power for detection and accuracy…it was too powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was their first time encountering a Class 9 soul tool. They only now realized why a Class 9 soul engineer could challenge a Titled Douluo even though his martial soul wasn’t very strong. In addition, they also discovered how a Class 9 soul engineer possessed an obvious advantage in a war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a duel, a Class 9 soul engineer was definitely inferior to a nine-ringed Titled Douluo. However, the Class 9 soul tools that they created were lethal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had seen a Class 8 soul tool before. However, it was far different from this Class 9 soul tool! Of course, the Sunmoon Divine Needle was one of the top-ranked Class 9 soul tools, too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou was a little excited as he whispered, “Little junior, this thing was custom-made for you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao focused his gaze and glared at him. He Caitou only then realized that he had said the wrong words, and quickly shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Nangong Wan and the Third Elder both heard him mention the words “little junior”. Although they were a little doubtful, they weren’t suspicious, as He Caitou didn’t expose anything further, so they didn’t say anything. After all, Huo Yuhao seemed like an evil soul master who specialized in spiritual calling. With his great spiritual power, he was very suited to use the Sunmoon Divine Needle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder snorted and said, “Don’t be fooled by Ye Yulin. His Sunmoon Divine Needle is good, but it takes three days to charge. In addition, it can only be charged using Sun Moon Essence. Its offensive strength is great, but it can only be used three times after being charged. Furthermore, a lot of soul power is depleted every time it’s used! It’s very taxing. The thirty kilometer effective range is theoretical, too. However, it’s true that it can reach sixteen hundred meters into the air.”</span></p>

You are indeed inferior to Ye Yulin in terms of high-altitude soul tools. He’s also representing the imperial family. Why do you have to pit yourself against him?

However, it’s best not to use it before you have nine rings, or you might suffer from a backlash. From what Ye Yulin said, I think he has some kind of self-detonation setting installed into it, too. Don’t try to dismantle it.”</span></p>
