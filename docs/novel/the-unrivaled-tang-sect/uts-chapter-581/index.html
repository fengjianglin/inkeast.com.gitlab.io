 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhongli Wu was unable to tell that Huo Yuhao was actually smiling under the Icy War God’s Armor. In fact, he was revealing a very satisfied smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was smiling because this scenario was extremely similar to what he had experienced when he first tried to form his Yin Yang Complement soul cores! However, back then, it was a lot more dangerous than his current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this tornado was extremely powerful, it was probably nothing compared to what he had to go through when he tried to form his first soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the help of this tornado, he was improving his mastery over the icy storm he was forming with the Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon technique. At the same time, he was gaining a better understanding of the element of air while he was being buffeted by the tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was no longer something that was within the realm of soul skills. It was a form of understanding that was required to create one’s own soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Di Tian had never properly explained it to Huo Yuhao, he had gradually discovered the biggest benefit of the Yin Yang Complement soul cores from his past few battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The biggest benefit was comprehension!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an enhanced ability to comprehend the laws of heaven and earth, and was not something that could be innately developed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven and earth were split into Yin and Yang. The formation of his Yin Yang soul cores allowed Huo Yuhao to observe and comprehend many things he could not even see in the past. These things included spatial power, elemental energy, and many other finer details.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, even while he was fighting his opponents, he was able to sense the changes in some of these power around him, and gain a better comprehension of these powers, even though the others would not be able to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was appreciating the power of wind, as well as the secrets behind wind-type elemental energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These wind-type elements were being forcefully controlled. However, It was apparent that both Zhongli Wu and his beast spirit—the Bone Dragon King—were simply relying on soul power to control these elements. After all, the Bone Dragon King was but a beast spirit, and not an actual dragon which had mastered the secrets of the element of air. Even though the Bone Dragon King had the ability to generate wind, it was not able to fully appreciate the intricacies behind wind-type power. Otherwise, it would no longer be the Bone Dragon King. It would have been the Silver Dragon King itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was trying to sense the changes in the wind-type elements through his ice-type elements, as well as appreciate how gentle and agile the wind was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a golden opportunity for him to improve his understanding of wind power. How else was he going to find so much wind-type elemental energy under normal circumstances?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the offensive power of the tornado, Huo Yuhao was not worried about it in the least. At the end of the day, Zhongli Wu was but a soul master, not a soul engineer. If a Class 9 soul engineer were to be the one attacking him instead, he would definitely not be using such a scattered form of attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the tornado was strong, its energy was very scattered. It would be extremely difficult for it to penetrate the Icy War God’s Armor—a top-tier Class 9 soul tool. Furthermore, the Icy War God’s Armor was built for defense. The Divine Ice Crystals which were used to make the armor granted it immense defensive capabilities. On top of that, the wind from the tornado could not even be compared to Ma Xiaotao’s Ultimate Fire, which had been extremely destructive. Hence, the flickering light on Huo Yuhao’s Icy War God’s Armor was created intentionally by Huo Yuhao to dupe Zhongli Wu into believing that he was expending a lot of power to counter the tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhongli Wu would not be duped that easily. After all, he had a wealth of battle experience. In less than half a minute, he realized that something was amiss. He started to realize that the color of his tornado was starting to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its original green color was now infused with tinges of blue. This blue did not belong to his wind-type elements!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was Huo Yuhao’s martial soul? His main martial soul was his Spirit Eyes. At every point in time, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was enshrouding the entire battlefield. He was immediately able to react the moment he discovered that Zhongli Wu’s aura was starting to change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The extremely concentrated air current which was in his hand was suddenly released as it collided with the huge tornado. An unbelievable sight formed before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden sun and blue moon which were behind Huo Yuhao suddenly fused together when the icy tornado he released collided with the huge tornado.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gigantic tornado suddenly paused in the air before disintegrating into tiny tornadoes which scrambled in every possible direction. The huge cluster of wind-type element energy instantly broke free from Zhongli Wu’s control and scattered everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was extremely frustrated after seeing how Huo Yuhao destroyed his tornado. He felt as though he had stripped a copious amount of elemental energy from his body at that instant. On top of that, he did not seem to be hurt at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu immediately recognized the problem at hand. Even though he was not aware of Huo Yuhao’s two soul cores, he was starting to sense that something wasn’t quite right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bone Dragon King beneath his feet let out a low roar, following which, it tilted its humongous head upwards and released a green ball of light towards Huo Yuhao from its mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ball of green light was not big. It was only about the size of a human head. This made it seem very disproportionate when compared to the size of the Bone Dragon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu pointed at the ball of green light with the staff in his hand as the soul rings on his body shone. Streaks of light landed on the ball of green light as the color of the ball became a lot darker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Detection on the ball of light, he was instantly startled by what he detected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he didn’t know what Zhongli Wu’s move was called, he couldn’t help but shiver in fear. This sensation was extremely similar to what he had experienced when he first used his Spiritual Detection to analyze the decomposition cannon shell. There was an insane amount of wind-type elemental energy compressed within that tiny ball of light. Its power was definitely several times stronger than that of a decomposition cannon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A streak of azure blue sword light descended from the sky and slashed accurately at the ball of light. Unparalleled Chill, Empress’ Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The usually invincible Ultimate Ice was instantly pulverized the moment it came into contact with the ball of green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pulverized? Even my ice-type elemental energy was pulverized? How can Zhongli Wu control such concentrated and volatile wind-type energy? He must have borrowed that power from the Silver Dragon King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, the ball of green light was approaching Huo Yuhao. There was no way that he could use spatial power to evade the ball. After all, the surrounding space and void were already messed up by the violent and chaotic wind-type elemental energy. Huo Yuhao could not even use his Instant Teleportation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Icy War God’s Armor might not even be able to block this crazy ball of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that case, I shall do this then!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retracted his right first before punching it outwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sneer formed on Zhongli Wu’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ball of green light was called Extreme Wind. It was the strongest attack he could muster with the wind-type elemental energy he could control. By condensing the wind-type elements to an extremely dense state, he could slice an entire mountain with his Extreme Wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is he really planning to use his fist to block my Extreme Wind? I can’t believe he isn’t even using a soul skill to parry my attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the sneering expression on his face only lasted for a short while. At the very next instant, the ball of green light disappeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?! This is impossible.” Zhongli Wu almost leaped out and exclaimed in rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Huo Yuhao was somehow able to survive after a humongous explosion, he would still be able to accept that as an outcome. However, the green ball had somehow vanished. This was something he could not accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a ball that contained incredibly violent and chaotic wind-type energy! How could it disappear just like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao would not be telling him the answer. When he launched his fist, he was actually borrowing the effects of spatial power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the space and void around him had been messed up by the wind, he did not stop chanting his incantations. A small spatial gate had opened up before his fist after his incantations were complete. This door was a spectral gate that led to the spectral demiplane. Hence, he was able to direct the Extreme Wind effortlessly into the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was definitely unable to accurately determine how much damage the Extreme Wind would do within the spectral demiplane. However, he knew it would not land at the same place as where Ma Xiaotao was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao did not manage to achieve this at no cost. He had to invest a lot of effort and energy to stabilize the space before his fist in order to direct the Extreme Wind into his spectral demiplane. If not for his increased understanding of spatial power, he might not have been able to pull it off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Extreme Wind vanished, the surrounding space became normal again. And Huo Yuhao’s body disappeared at the very next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark sky above them suddenly became incredibly cold as snowflakes started to fall from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Zhongli Wu was displeased with how things had turned out, he was able to regain his composure very quickly. The air around him suddenly became extremely restless. The green wind vanished, to be replaced by intense fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky instantly turned red as the surrounding temperature, which had just plunged, started to rise again. Huge amounts of fiery meteors ravaged the sky as they collided with the snowflakes released by Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this what the Silver Dragon King can do? It has moved onto the element of fire after controlling the element of air!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice collided with the fiery meteor shower, brilliant flashes of red and blue illuminated the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the fiery meteor shower released by Zhongli Wu through his Bone Dragon King was not of Ultimate Fire, its quantity was a lot greater than what Huo Yuhao had summoned. With the support of his incredible soul power, the meteor shower brought its insanely destructive power almost everywhere. Huo Yuhao’s Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was unable to even fully take shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rings of fiery light were also radiating constantly around Zhongli Wu’s body. This prevented Huo Yuhao from getting near him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power of the fire was a lot more frightening than that of the wind previously. It was a lot more violent and explosive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bones on the Bone Dragon King had turned completely red as it flapped its huge wings. It was like a gigantic fire dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Neutralizing ice with fire was undoubtedly a wise decision. This was especially smart when Huo Yuhao had already expended large amounts of soul power in his previous battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was following his plan closely as he aimed to drain Huo Yuhao of his soul power. He would not be giving him any chance to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were to compete purely based on techniques, Huo Yuhao might have a chance to showcase his abilities. However, when they were competing on soul power, it would depend on who had a higher rank, and who had larger reserves of soul power. Huo Yuhao would never be able to evade such attacks no matter how powerful his Spiritual Detection was. It was not hard for Zhongli Wu to launch attacks with huge areas of effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, very soon, Huo Yuhao reappeared in the sky. The effects of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice were still present, as snowflakes neutralized every fiery meteor that was about to hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao seemed to be suppressed by Zhongli Wu quite badly. Even the Icy War God’s Armor on his body was starting to show charred marks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu remained on the head of his Bone Dragon King. His face revealed a solemn expression, and no one could tell what he was feeling. However, everyone could tell that he had gained the upper hand in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of battle was extremely shameless for the evil soul masters, especially when he was fighting Huo Yuhao, who was already weakened by his previous battles. However, evil soul masters would never be concerned with intangible things like shame.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s audible sigh could be heard by everyone who was spectating this battle. It seemed like he was at his wits’ end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Zhongli Wu was undeniably shameless, it was still a brilliant move. He had chosen to launch a head-on attack. Besides, he was even able to control the direction of his meteor shower to focus it on Huo Yuhao, forcing him to block the fiery meteors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew what the outcome would be if this were to continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this the power of fire? Violent and cruel?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao was sighing, he was actually smiling as he sensed the transformation in the fire-type elements around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rumored that the Silver Dragon King could control the following elements: fire, water, earth, wind, light, dark, and space. He could also control mutated elements, which included lightning, ice, and many other elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Bone Dragon King was only blessed by the Silver Dragon King, and was definitely unable to control every single element. Huo Yuhao wished it could control more so that he could learn more about the different elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao sensed that Zhongli Wu was about to use fire to curb his ice powers, he almost burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he possessed Ultimate Ice! On top of that, his Icy War God’s Armor was built from Divine Ice Crystals. It usually took more than ten thousand years just to form a small piece of such crystal. They were naturally extremely resistant to fire-type energy. If the wind earlier was not able to penetrate the armor, the fiery meteor shower would not even stand a chance. Huo Yuhao had no idea why Zhongli Wu had decided to use such a method to attack him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he admitted that it was a pretty good experience feeling the beauty of the fire-type element.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, as someone who naturally possessed ice-type powers, Huo Yuhao would always struggle with developing a deep understanding of the element of fire, no matter how powerful his comprehension was. This was an elemental problem, and it was not related to his comprehension ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing how ineffective his continuous fiery meteor shower was, Zhongli Wu waved the staff in his hand again as the Bone Dragon King tilted its head upwards to release a blue fiery ball at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Similar to the Extreme Wind earlier, this blue flaming ball was undoubtedly insanely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it disappeared in the same way as the Extreme Wind. Huo Yuhao could only apologize to the spectral demiplane later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky suddenly quieted down in an eerie manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So far, both sides had battled in a fairly balanced way, as though both parties were just trying to better understand each other’s abilities. Even though it looked as though Huo Yuhao was at a disadvantage, Zhongli Wu had probably expended more soul power than him. At least, this was what Huo Yuhao believed. Even though he had also expended his soul power during this period of time, he was able to get away with expending less soul power because of his Icy War God’s Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao.” Zhongli Wu’s cold voice rang in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared calmly at Zhongli Wu and replied, “Yes? What do you have to say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu suddenly smiled. It seemed as though he was genuinely very happy. “Do you really think you’re very smart? Do you really think you will be able to negate most of my attacks with minimal soul power by using your Class 9 soul tool?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” Huo Yuhao was caught off-guard by Zhongli Wu’s words. “What are you trying to say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu flashed a smile and said, “I just want to tell you that you’re wrong. I was just charging up my energy while I was throwing wind and fire at you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Charging up energy?” Huo Yuhao was not sure what Zhongli Wu was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu said, “There’s no need to hide it from you. After all, you will be one of us very soon.” Only Huo Yuhao could hear what he was saying.</span></p>
