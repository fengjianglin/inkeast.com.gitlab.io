He wasn’t afraid of her harming Tai Tan, because he could sense the link between their powers when she made her move. However, her abilities were inferior to his by default. This meant that the abilities she unleashed would never surpass his own capabilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, Tai Tan managed to break free from the ice as Huo Yuhao backed off. The broken pieces of ice fell onto the ground, and he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at her. He said helplessly, “Little fellow, I’ve no intention of harming you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against such a small kid, what could they possibly do? They couldn’t hit or scold her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot. She was scared off by your ugly mug.” Niu Tian pulled Tai Tan behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan was very displeased. “Elder brother, my abilities are indeed inferior to yours. However, our appearances are around the same—they are nothing special. Why don’t you say you’re the one who scared her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian glared at him and said, “Neither of us should be going over and scaring her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t act like they were the Clear Sky Sect’s sect masters from their cautious behavior. At this moment, Huo Yuhao also recovered from his shock. He lifted his hand and touched the Snow Lady’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was evidently very attached to him. As he extended his hand, she immediately wrapped her hand around his finger and laughed non-stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could sense that she wasn’t a solid entity. While her hand was soft and gentle, it didn’t feel like a human hand. However, she didn’t seem like she was made purely of energy. It was an unclear feeling. She was like a special existence between a solid entity and energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, this is the life that all of you created? She was originally a soul beast?” Niu Tian asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Teacher said that the Snow Lady was an Icesky Snow Lady formed from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. She’s a special type of soul beast, and might not even be considered a soul beast. In fact, I also don’t know what made her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Icesky Snow Lady?” Both Niu Tian and Tai Tan were shocked as they heard his words. They looked at each other before they said in unison, “Snow Empress?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned as he replied, “So you know her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan lost his voice as he said, “How could we not know her? She’s one of the Ten Great Savage Beasts of the Douluo Continent, and has lived for six or seven hundred thousand years. She’s one of the most powerful soul beasts. She has turned into this? What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew that some things couldn’t be concealed forever. After pondering for a moment, he recounted how he had discovered the Snow Empress’ embryo and managed to absorb it into his body by sealing it with the help of his teacher. However, he didn’t reveal his secrets regarding Skydream and the Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After listening to his recounting of events, the two sect masters were in disbelief. Surely this wasn’t luck, since he almost lost his life because of it, but the Snow Empress’ strength had helped him greatly! Subconsciously, they reckoned that the enhancement of his martial soul was due to the Snow Empress. In addition, there was still the infant Snow Lady now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian pointed at the Snow Lady and asked, “Did your teacher mention what kind of life form the current Snow Empress is?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and shook his head. He replied, “He didn’t know what kind of life form the Snow Empress’ strength would become after this all developed. He only told me that the newborn Snow Empress would be tightly connected to me. That’s because a large amount of my spiritual power and blood are fused into her body. With that, a contract, and the Snow Empress’ original strength and spiritual sense, this new life form was born. He called her Spirit. The Snow Empress’ Spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spirit was an entirely new existence not only to these two sect masters, but also to the entire Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Interrupting their conversation, the Snow Lady started to shriek again. Her crisp voice sounded very anxious, and drew their attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Huo Yuhao could understand what she was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about me not wanting you?” Huo Yuhao asked, perplexed. The Snow Lady had mentioned that her daddy didn’t want her anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady drifted from his shoulder, and tears flowed from her huge eyes. She stared at him before saying “yi yi ya ya” again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was completely confused. “No place for you? What do you mean? Can you be a bit clearer?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was pointed at him while she sobbed before starting to draw circles in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was suddenly enlightened. “Are you talking about soul rings? You want something to do with my soul rings?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She nodded her head hurriedly, and her silvery-white hair swayed slightly. Her chubby face also trembled a little—it was extremely cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you saying that there’s no empty soul ring spot for you to control?” He started to understand what she was saying. However, how was she going to control his soul rings? He was completely clueless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snow Lady, hear me out. My cultivation is currently Rank 50. Logically speaking, there should be space for a soul ring! How is there no place for you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She shook her head and started to “yi yi ya ya” again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? One is not enough?” Huo Yuhao was stunned as he said, “Are you saying that your powers will fall if there aren’t sufficient soul ring spots for you? You need my powers to ensure the growth and stability of your powers?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I already have four soul rings! I can’t possibly sacrifice them. I have no choice either!” Huo Yuhao was put in a spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot.” Tai Tan couldn’t help but mutter. “Rascal, you really are dumb! Others couldn’t do anything if they were in such a situation, but you have twin martial souls. Don’t tell me that your second martial soul also has four soul rings. You can’t be that much of a fool!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, ‘The one in the situation is confused, but the onlooker sees clear.’ Tai Tan’s words enlightened Huo Yuhao immediately. Yes! His Spirit Eyes only had one spot for a soul ring, but his Ice Empress still had many spots! He only had one soul ring on his Ice Empress martial soul. Furthermore, his Ice Empress wouldn’t ostracize the powers of the Snow Lady. They were both ice-type, and complemented each other. However, he was curious as to why the Snow Empress wanted to live among his soul rings. Would he have to add soul rings in these positions in the future? What would the relationship between Spirit and him be like after she took up those spots?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was troubled by these doubts, he quickly unleashed his second martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An extreme chill was released from his body. The immense aura of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion was exuded amidst the glow of a hundred thousand year soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sect masters focused their gazes, looking at the blood-red soul ring with four streaks of golden patterns. The Snow Lady was also in a slight daze. As she looked at Huo Yuhao, she seemed to be sensing something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief moment, she cheered. Her body shrank slightly before she flew towards Huo Yuhao as an orange-gold ball of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wanted to catch her, but the ball of light penetrated his body cleanly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body turned rigid, and started to tremble tremendously. An intense orange-gold glow was emitted from his body, and even his eyes turned orange.</span></p>

Although the Snow Lady wasn’t very friendly towards the both of them, she was still very cute! No one could resist her. Moreover, she hadn’t really harmed them.</span></p>

It queued behind the previous soul ring and moved along with it. The intensity of the light from both soul rings were the same. Huo Yuhao’s aura also became stronger and stronger.</span></p>

She could even be considered a true living soul ring. If soul rings were alive, they could be more proactive.</span></p>

No matter how great her strength was, it would still be depleted continuously. That was why she needed to rely on Huo Yuhao to restore her strength regardless of the presence of a contract. She might also need him to develop greater strength.</span></p>
