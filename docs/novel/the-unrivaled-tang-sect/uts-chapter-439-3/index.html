She only allowed him to test whether they could fuse in the passageways of her forearm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could clearly sense that Tang Wutong’s soul power flowed in a structured manner, and there was even an aura of elegance about it. When their soul powers first came into contact with each other, Tang Wutong’s soul power displayed strong discrimination towards Huo Yuhao’s soul power. It was like it wanted to force his soul power out of her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned to find out that Tang Wutong was right! While his soul power wasn’t any less powerful than hers, there was some kind of gap between them. This was a result of the difference between the blood lineages of their martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How is this possible? I have twin martial souls, and I even possess Ultimate Ice. Moreover, I’ve fused with four Spirits, which has significantly modified my martial soul. How is it possible that the tier of my martial soul is so much weaker than hers?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, his soul power would immediately fuse with Wang Dong’er’s soul power when they first came into contact with one another, turning into Haodong Power that would circulate through their bodies. This greatly increased their cultivation speed. To a large extent, the reason why Huo Yuhao’s cultivation speed was able to rise so quickly was because of the Haodong Power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the situation seemed to have completely changed now. The circulation of soul power in Tang Wutong’s body was presented as an elegant, purplish-gold color. During the process of circulation, her body exuded a dim, purplish-gold glow. Huo Yuhao could even sense that the soul power circulating in her body was subtly rocking with the sound of a dragon roaring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amid this rocking movement, Huo Yuhao’s soul power was crushed before it could return to his body. Even though it would reform very quickly, it wasn’t able to move an inch forward in Tang Wutong’s body, much less complete any fusion. It was like they were supposed to be distinctly separated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Tang Wutong’s wrist trembled slightly, the soul power in her body started to circulate at a greater intensity. Huo Yuhao moved back three feet, as if he had been pushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong’s body slightly shone with a purplish-gold glow, and an image of a golden trident flashed on her forehead before disappearing. She twisted her lips and said, “I’ve already told you that your martial soul can’t fuse with me. Your instincts were wrong. If you really had some sort of sensation, I would experience the same sensation too. You can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sat where he was in a daze. The expression on his face remained the same, and his entire body seemed to have turned into a statue – he was completely motionless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong furrowed her brow. “Hey! Why aren’t you leaving yet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao slowly lowered his arms, and Tang Wutong could tell that his face had turned completely pale. It was as if he had lost his life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he slowly stood up, Huo Yuhao walked towards the exit of the tent with a pale look on his face. When he drew open the curtains and walked out, he staggered and almost fell down. After this, his steps were very shaky as he walked away from the tent. He didn’t even utter a word to Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was stunned as she watched him leave. She was stunned to find out that she felt a little heartbroken for some unknown reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Am I feeling heartbroken for him? How is this possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Do I have to feel this way? Our martial souls are just incompatible, aren’t they? Why does he look like he just lost his wife?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What she didn’t know was that Huo Yuhao didn’t sense anything similar between her and Wang Dong’er’s soul power as their martial souls failed to fuse. To him, it was indeed as if he had lost his wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong isn’t Dong’er, Tang Wutong isn’t Dong’er, Tang Wutong isn’t Dong’er…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thought repeated itself in Huo Yuhao’s head. He seemed as if he had lost his soul. He was completely in a trance right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even know how he made his way back to his tent. After he returned, he laid down on his own bed and didn’t move at all. It was as if he already lost his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he lay on his bed, Huo Yuhao didn’t know when he started to fall asleep. However, he felt as if his life energy had been completely drained as he fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

She muttered to herself, “This fellow is ridiculous. The possibility of fusion between two soul masters is naturally close to zero. What’s there to be so depressed about? However, he really looks to have been in poor shape earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After sitting down on her bed, Tang Wutong started to meditate and began her cultivation for the night.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a night of meditation, her fatigue had completely disappeared. As she stretched her body, she couldn’t help, but let out a groan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she reached the exit of her tent, she drew the curtains aside and allowed fresh air to flow into her tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That fellow didn’t sleep the entire night?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong subconsciously turned her attention towards the tent beside hers just as she walked out of her tent. She couldn’t help but think of Huo Yuhao’s pale face when he left the previous night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just at this moment, the curtains of the tent beside hers were also drawn open. Tang Wutong quickly turned her gaze away.</span></p>

As he stood in front of his tent, he also stretched out.</span></p>

When she saw him, he seemed to have returned to normal. The expression on his face was very calm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled courteously before walking towards the canteen that Dai Yueheng had pointed out to them the day before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were allocated the canteen that served high-ranking military officers. Soul masters were different from ordinary people. Their food requirements were much more demanding. In order to ensure that their soul masters possessed sufficient fighting strength, the Star Luo Empire naturally provided them with the best food possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong felt as if Huo Yuhao had changed when she saw him walking past her.</span></p>

But why do I feel as if he’s different?</span></p>

Yes, it’s alienation. He’s no longer as friendly as before. The look in his eyes isn’t as gentle as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she recalled the first time she met him, she could still remember that he would look at her whenever she was around. However, this wasn’t the case earlier. Even though he had looked at her earlier, he had quickly retracted his gaze. After greeting her, he quietly left. The look in his eyes was very calm, but this calm look left Tang Wutong feeling a little uncomfortable.</span></p>
