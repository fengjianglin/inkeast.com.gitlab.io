 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile appeared on Di Tian’s lips.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young man, you must not have expected this. I’ve already treated you as my nemesis the moment you dared to challenge me. How could I have survived until now without giving my all every time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian used to be invincible in the past. Indeed, he was very arrogant. However, he was really hurt after he was attacked by evil soul masters not long ago. Although his injury wasn’t very serious and he managed to retaliate, he was still left with a deep impression then. This also reminded him of how powerful humans could be. They could already threaten him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he didn’t hesitate to unleash his strongest attack after he felt that Huo Yuhao already had an unprecedented third soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Di Tian didn’t know how strong a third soul core would be, he must have possessed twin soul cores for hundreds of thousands of years longer than Huo Yuhao. How could he not have any understanding of third soul cores? This was why he didn’t want to give Huo Yuhao a chance to unleash his full strength. He used his greatest power the moment he attacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon’s Claw didn’t belong to him, but the Dragon God. This demigod-like power had threatened many of his enemies who were once stronger than him. It had helped him to become the Beast God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, when he used it again, Huo Yuhao was completely suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lights coming from Huo Yuhao’s body kept on transforming. In Di Tian’s eyes, he seemed to see Huo Yuhao’s three soul cores shining non-stop. Every time they shone, his soul power would spread with stronger momentum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what was the point of this? Even if he had three soul cores, his power was still at the human tier. It still couldn’t compare to the power of a god. Regarding this, Di Tian was extremely clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression seemed to turn cold. Behind him, the projections of his Spirits kept on flashing. However, they only flashed for a short period of time before they changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t sense the changes coming from Di Tian’s body. However, Di Tian could sense that he was using different types of soul power to break out from this restraint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon God’s Claw had already turned golden. The tip of his claw was already shining with a rainbow glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s no use.

What you can only do is drain your own soul power in the face of the power of a demigod. Don</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">’</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">t worry.

I want to complete my perfect plan, which I mentioned to you earlier. When your soul power is drained, I</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">’</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">ll take you back to the Great Star Dou Forest.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at Di Tian calmly. The soul power undulations coming from his body suddenly weakened. When they weakened, Di Tian’s rainbow glow suddenly shone brighter. The entire sky started to distort, and Huo Yuhao’s body started to tighten, as if it could possibly be crushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was stunned for a moment. An Ultimate Douluo was not supposed to cave in so easily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that an icy-blue light flashed before it disappeared instantly. Di Tian only felt that everything in front of him was empty. After this, that icy-blue light was in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ding!” Di Tian raised his Dragon God’s Claw and blocked the invasion of that icy-blue light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that icy-blue light instantly bloomed like a flower, forming countless streaks of icy-blue light. Di Tian’s body was completely engulfed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian wasn’t the only one with demigod-like abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had been complacent, but so was Di Tian. He didn’t dare to kill Huo Yuhao. If he had attacked with all his might earlier, Huo Yuhao would most likely have been severely hurt. However, he only wanted to assume control over him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sigh of the Frozen Goddess, Morning Dew Dagger! It was a powerful weapon of the God of Emotions. When Huo Yuhao completed the formation of his third soul core, he was finally able to unleash demigod-like abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At his tier, his Icy War God Armor was no longer as effective as it used to be. However, the Morning Dew Dagger was different. Even if he became a god, it would still be a very useful weapon for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rain Dragon’s Dance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two figures suddenly flashed past after a short few seconds. Di Tian broke open space and appeared a thousand meters away. His Dragon God’s Claw was already rainbow-colored. However, there were seven wounds on his body. None of them were very big, and no blood was seeping out. However, there was a layer of frost on top of each of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, did it really look as simple as it was on the surface?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was panting a thousand meters away. His Morning Dew Dagger was flashing with a bluish glow. Light fog drifted around the bluish glow, making it seem extremely divine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Di Tian was watching him, and was already looking very serious.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demigod-like abilities. He actually possesses demigod-like abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Di Tian could tell that Huo Yuhao was hugely drained with every attack he unleashed, he also knew that he was hurt from the previous attack. The strength of Ultimate Ice was quickly invading his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, it wasn’t just Ultimate Ice. There was also Huo Yuhao’s spiritual intent and spatial power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spatial power could be neutralized, but Huo Yuhao’s spiritual intent and Ultimate Ice were already causing destruction. If not for his immense physical strength, he would have been greatly hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was hurt. He was really hurt again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian slowly lifted his Dragon God’s Claw. Suddenly, he looked into the sky, and a dragon’s roar turned into countless echoing sounds. The huge black dragon projection behind him exploded and turned into a black fog that surged into that rainbow dragon projection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, rainbow lights shone brightly, and turned Di Tian into the same colors. He stretched his Dragon’s God Claw out towards Huo Yuhao. A huge dragon claw suddenly appeared out of thin air before it reached out towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was tightly holding onto his Morning Dew Dagger, and he suddenly took in a deep breath. Thick icy fog suddenly rose at an alarming speed, turning into rings of icy fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao then raised his dagger high above his head. At this instant, Huo Yuhao was completely covered in a holy aura. It gave him an indescribable feeling. It was as if he had completely fused with the dagger at this instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His facial expression turned gentler. As ice and fog gathered, Huo Yuhao disappeared. He was replaced by a graceful figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t the Ice or Snow Empress. It was also not the Goddess of Light. It was just an icy-blue figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was more than a hundred meters tall, and she released an icy, foggy aura from her body. Her appearance wasn’t very clear, but she was wearing an icy-blue dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ai---” A voice started to ring out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this, a ball of icy-blue fog surfaced from her head and received the Dragon God’s Claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rainbow projection stopped instantly, and turned icy-blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s this? It’s already stronger than Ultimate Ice!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength of the Dragon God’s Claw was actually quickly being drained, as it were being frozen by the icy-blue fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he didn’t know that this was Huo Yuhao’s unused ninth soul skill. It was the ninth soul skill of his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he attained nine rings, Huo Yuhao originally believed that he could obtain a ninth soul ring from the Ice Bear King. However, he experienced a mutation then. His ninth soul skill didn’t appear directly. Instead, it was very ambiguous, as if it were just a haze. Although his ninth soul ring was red, Huo Yuhao didn’t know what his soul skill was going to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only when the Ice and Snow Empresses burned their spiritual sense and fused completely with him that his ninth soul skill presented itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a hundred thousand year soul ring, he naturally had two ninth soul skills. These two soul skills didn’t just belong to any Spirit. All of his ice-type Spirits had them. They also fused with the strength of his Morning Dew Dagger. They were two extreme soul skills of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao was using one of them. By using the Morning Dew Dagger as a guide, he was able to unleash the immense power of this soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao named this soul skill the Sigh of the Frozen Goddess!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blow!” Huo Yuhao’s cold voice resonated in the sky. Di Tian’s body shook, and a strong black glow was released from his body. Even so, a series of explosive sounds were still heard from his body. It was characteristic of the Ice Explosion Technique, after Ultimate Ice was introduced into Di Tian’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The frozen Dragon God’s Claw started shuddering. After all, the Sigh of the Frozen Goddess was Huo Yuhao’s soul skill, and not really the power of the Icesky Snow Goddess, whereas the Dragon God’s Claw was extremely close to the power of the Dragon God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Huo Yuhao suddenly moved. He didn’t advance, but retreated instead. He was already in front of the frozen Dragon God’s Claw, and he smacked it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Piak---” Di Tian’s body shook. Due to the Ice Explosion Technique, he wasn’t able to control his claw or intercept Huo Yuhao. He could only watch blindly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the next moment, Di Tian’s pupils shrank. This was because he was astonished to find out that his connection with the Dragon God’s Claw had been cut off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Huo Yuhao actually possesses such a power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his second ultimate ninth soul skill, Absolute Zero! It was combined with the Snowless Glacier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, Absolute Zero was used to consolidate the Sigh of the Frozen Goddess, before it was poured into Di Tian’s body using the Snowless Glacier. The terrifyingly low temperature and god-like strength of the Morning Dew Dagger finally blocked off Di Tian’s lethal strike.</span></p>
