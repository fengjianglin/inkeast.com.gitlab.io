 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui spoke gently, "Xiaoyao, this is our last moment together in this world. Even though our lives are ending soon, I want to be your wife from this moment onwards. Will you be my husband? From now on, you no longer have to listen to my orders. I will do whatever you ask me to do and be a good wife, alright?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao stared at Ye Xishui and said, "All this while, I thought that you were the person to whom I owed the greatest apology. Now, I finally realize that Mu En is the one whom we need to apologize to. He must have suffered a lot more pain than we went through. Even though he has died, he still did not know what actually happened all those years ago. You are really cruel to him!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui sighed and said, "Sometimes, ignorance is bliss. We often underestimate time's ability to heal wounds. The reason why I have not visited him in all these years was so that I would not reawaken those painful memories. At the end of the day, he eventually had a family and took on responsibilities at Shrek Academy. Even if those painful memories were still a part of him, they would be but a small part of his existence. In my opinion, you suffered more by staying by my side."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao turned around and looked in the direction of Shrek Academy before saying, "Brother Mu, who would have known that both of us were badly mistaken about the truth back then? The Holy Ghost Church had always been our common enemy! Xishui, you are right. At the very least, I’ll know what actually happened before I die. I will not die like an ignorant fool. Brother Mu, it seems like I won't be able to repay what I owe you in this life! I guess I can only make it up to you by doing a favor for your disciple."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing his sentence, he quickly turned around and looked at Ye Xishui. "Xishui, are you really willing to follow everything I say?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui nodded silently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Okay! Even though you won't be able to make up for everything you have done, let's try to leave something behind on this continent. Let us do something for Brother Mu. How does that sound?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui smiled and said, "I will do anything you ask me to."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao turned around to face Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. "Yuhao, I had originally planned for you to look for me after you reached Rank 98. Previously, Xuan Zi had written to me about how you had managed to form Yin Yang Complement soul cores. Is that true?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Yin Yang Complement? He actually did it?" Ye Xishui was very surprised by what she heard. "No wonder he was able to take down so many of our evil soul masters. He had actually managed to form Yin Yang Complement Soul Cores, something which only Di Tian has managed to accomplish. Tell me, lad, how was your body able to withstand the frightening amount of pressure?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chose not to answer Ye Xishui's question. He merely nodded at Long Xiaoyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you have already formed your second soul core before becoming an Ultimate Douluo, this means that you will have to form your third soul core when you are pushing for Rank 99. I can foresee how that will be incredibly difficult. I originally wanted to help you in your final push, but it seems like I won’t have a chance to help you anymore. As I continue to weaken before I die, there is no longer any use for me to hold onto my soul power. If I were to give it to you, it might actually help you to form your third soul core. At the very least, I would actually help you to make history. However, I don’t think I can live to see you reach Rank 98. I guess I can only pass you the purest thing within my soul power, as well as some of the things I have comprehended in the past few years. This will be the only way I can repay Mu En.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Long, I can’t accept this.” Huo Yuhao held his hand before him. He was shocked to learn that Long Xiaoyao was actually looking for him for this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled and shook his head. “Don’t reject my offer. This is my last wish. If you were to reject me, I won’t be able to rest in peace. Besides, I would rather pass what I have cultivated to someone rather than let it disintegrate into nothing. You don’t have to worry about me handing all of my soul power to you. I will only be passing you the purest and most basic thing within my soul power. I will inject this pure energy into your body and allow you to digest it slowly. At the same time, it will probably help you establish a foundation for your future third soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing his sentence, Long Xiaoyao turned around to look at Tang Wutong. “To be honest, I didn’t expect you to have formed your second soul core too. Is it also a Yin Yang Complement soul core?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong glanced at Huo Yuhao before nodding. “Yes. I only managed to complete it with Yuhao’s help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Great! That’s great! Xishui, I need you to hand your soul power to this lady. This is my final request for you. We will leave our power in their hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was a little stunned, but she immediately nodded before looking at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Tang Wutong seemed to have a different idea. She shook her head violently and said, “I don’t want the power of an evil soul master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui gave her a bitter smile before saying, “I no longer have any power from my evil soul master self. In fact, all of my evil soul power, including the Death God Pagoda, was destroyed back at the Palace. Even my Blood Soul Demonpuppet martial soul and my very own body had been destroyed. Can’t you tell that I no longer have a body? I am now but a body of energy. The only reason my soul did not shatter was because my cultivation was sufficiently high. I had originally only intended to protect Xiaoyao and get him out alive. I didn’t know that he was already severely injured before then. Hence, his life is also coming to an end. You can rest assured that my Radiant Phoenix martial soul has not been tainted with anyone’s blood. It only contains the purest radiant power, which is also the kind and gentle side of me. Now, I am no longer the Death God Douluo. I am but Long Xiaoyao’s wife. Ye Xishui has already died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong frowned after hearing her words. She still could not overcome the psychological barrier in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this very instant, an extremely familiar voice rang in her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She is right. She is no longer the Death God Douluo. All of the filthy things in her body died during the explosion. Help them fulfill their final wish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father!” Tang Wutong exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao, Long Xiaoyao, and Ye Xishui were shocked upon hearing what Tang Wutong had just said. It was important to note that they were all at the pinnacle of the world of soul masters. How could they not know if someone else was also present?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong gave them an awkward smile and explained, “Sorry! I suddenly remembered something my father told me. Alright. I will accept it. But I won’t thank you for your gift.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui smiled. “I have never asked anyone for gratitude. I am just doing what my husband wants. Xiaoyao is right. I owe Mu En too much. I’m just glad that I can do something for his disciple in the last few moments of my life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned to face Long Xiaoyao, only to see the sincerity in his eyes. The Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s Skull of Destiny did not give him any warning of impending danger. He knew that neither of them were trying to trick them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Long, is there really no way to save you?” Huo Yuhao asked sadly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao flickered and reappeared behind him. “I have explained myself already. I want to die before Xishui. Sit down.” As he spoke, he placed one of his hands on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. Even though he was already severely injured, the Dragon Emperor Douluo was still incredibly strong. Huo Yuhao was forced into a sitting position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also sat down before Huo Yuhao as they faced one another. They could see the sadness and shock in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui stood behind Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong respectively. They placed their palms behind both of their backs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You two can fuse your martial souls, right? I need both of you to start cultivating, and slowly receive our soul power.” Long Xiaoyao ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay!” Huo Yuhao raised his palms and placed them against Tang Wutong’s. At that instant, their Haodong Power started to flow between them as countless little vortexes began to move between their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had enveloped his Spiritual Detection around the four of them. Even though his intuition told him that he would not be in any danger, he knew that he should still be wary of Ye Xishui. After all, she was the most powerful evil soul master within the Holy Ghost Church! If Ye Xishui were to decide to do something bad to Tang Wutong, Huo Yuhao would immediately use his Xuanwu Displacement to switch places with her. He believed that he should still be able to handle her blow, especially with the current state she was in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, it seemed like Huo Yuhao’s intuition was correct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui had inserted their soul power in a gentle way into both of their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao exclaimed, “Yin Yang Complement soul cores are truly remarkable! They are definitely one of the miracles of our world. I have never seen such pure and condensed soul power. In fact, they have fused so well. The two soul cores complement one another while providing the necessary opposing forces to build up strength and power. This is truly the best way to train.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui nodded and said, “That’s right! Even though I had twin martial souls, I did not dare to train my Radiant Phoenix. I have always hidden it from everyone. If not, I might also have had a chance to form my own Yin Yang Complement soul cores. Who knows? They might just be able to challenge Di Tian with their human bodies if they are able to become Ultimate Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled and said, "Then let us be a part of this miracle."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui continued to channel their soul power into Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong's bodies. The soul power they were transferring did not have any elemental type. It was the purest kind of soul power. Their soul power was able to immediately fuse with the Haodong Power without any conversion.&nbsp;</span></p>
