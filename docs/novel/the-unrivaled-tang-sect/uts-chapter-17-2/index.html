 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 17.2: First Time Cooperating; Two People Control the Battlefield&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao gave an opposingly cold smile. “How will we know if we don’t try? However, you’re an assault system soul master, so you can’t be right next to us when the battle starts. Let’s spread out a bit. Let’s say… thirty metres.”</p>
 <p>As Huo Yuhao listened to the two’s argument, he gradually discovered how clever Xiao Xiao was. His Spiritual Detection Sharing had a fifty metre diameter, thus for Xiao Xiao to ask for Wang Dong to start off thirty metres away was equivalent to having him enter the range of his Spiritual Detection the instant he made a move.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong agreed without any hesitation at all.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao then said, “You can fly, but we can’t. This is a training session, so you’d better not fly away once you start losing.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong replied in a very casual manner. “I won’t leave the ground by more than five metres. Then, I’ll be heading over. You can shout ‘start’ when you guys are ready.” When he’d finished speaking, he began to walk away.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao immediately turned towards Huo Yuhao and said, “Class monitor, let’s kite this fool. It’ll be fine if you just use your Spiritual Detection Sharing to support me. Let’s make that arrogant guy eat a loss.”</p>
 <p>If this had been before Huo Yuhao had come to Shrek Academy, he definitely wouldn’t have known what ‘kiting’ was. However, he was extremely clear about what it was now—it was a tactic that relied on retreating as one fought.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll help you.” He also wanted to see just how strong Xiao Xiao and Wang Dong were. During the past three months, he hadn’t ever been able to see exactly how strong Wang Dong truly was when he used his martial soul to fight. However, he understood that even though Wang Dong was slightly more arrogant than others, he was just being self-confident, not arrogant. This was because self-confidence came from strength.</p>
 <p>The distance between the two sides quickly grew larger. Wang Dong lazily leaned against a large tree and gazed at the two that were thirty metres away from him—he’d even increased the distance between them a bit. He raised his arm and waved at Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao, indicating that he was ready.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao and Huo Yuhao stood next to each other. Xiao Xiao had a petite body, and was rather short compared to the rest of the class. She even had the title of ‘pocket-sized beauty’. She glanced at Huo Yuhao and nodded. “Class monitor, please assist me.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Xiao Xiao turn around and shout towards Wang Dong, “Start!” As soon as she spoke, she released her martial soul.</p>
 <p>Two yellow lights simultaneously lit up as soon as they rose from Xiao Xiao’s feet; she was actually a Soul Grandmaster! When Huo Yuhao saw this, he inwardly blushed from shame.</p>
 <p>The two shining soul rings rose from Xiao Xiao’s feet, but nothing seemed to happen to her body. However, a black shadow rapidly condensed above her head, clearly forming a three-legged cauldron that had two handles and a diameter of around one metre. This was Xiao Xiao’s main martial soul, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao activated his Spiritual Detection Sharing at the same time, causing a white soul ring to rise up from his feet. The onlooking Xiao Xiao couldn’t help but find it somewhat weak. She thought to herself, “No wonder the class monitor cultivates as hard as he does; his talent’s really lacking!”</p>
 <p>However, Xiao Xiao was quickly shocked by the mysterious scene that Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing showed her.</p>
 <p>Everything within a twenty-five metre diameter of them instantly became three-dimensional figures within her mind. She basically didn’t even have to think about them either—information about them rapidly appeared inside of her mind. She could even clearly sense the existence of every single strand of grass and bit of vegetation within the area that was surrounding them. Furthermore, besides the three-dimensional panoramic view that she’d suddenly received, she felt as if she suddenly had an extra brain that could help her process the new information that she was receiving.</p>
 <p>As Xiao Xiao glanced at Huo Yuhao, astonished, Wang Dong had already begun to make his move.</p>
 <p>Although Wang Dong seemed to be looking down on Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao on the surface, he wasn’t being careless at all. He’d personally experienced Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing, so he was fully aware of the fact that it could predict an opponent’s movements.</p>
 <p>A dazzling pair of blue wings instantly spread out from his back, causing Wang Dong’s body to also be covered in an exotic colour that seemed to constantly change between blue and purple. Furthermore, a few golden balls of light appeared on his enormous pair of wings and lit up, forming a ‘V’. As his two soul rings rose up from his feet, one yellow and one purple, his Radiant Butterfly Goddess was fully released.</p>
 <p>With a flash, Wang Dong rushed out at high speed. The balls of light on his wings began to emit soulforce, which caused his speed to instantly reach an extreme level.</p>
 <p>This wasn’t a soul skill, but an innate skill that belonged to his Radiant Butterfly Goddess. From this alone, it could be seen how strong his martial soul was.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s sudden increase in speed caused him to instantly cross a distance of ten or so metres; he had already nearly arrived in front of Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao. The result of an assault system soul master approaching two control system soul masters who had no means of engaging him in close-combat could be imagined. Their defeat seemed to be inevitable.</p>
 <p>When Wang Dong was only twenty-five metres away from Huo Yuhao and Xiao Xiao, a digital representation of his movements instantly appeared in Xiao Xiao’s brain. This included the trajectory of his movements, the minute changes in his body, the smallest changes in his martial soul… even the rotation of Wang Dong’s soulforce within his meridians could be faintly examined by Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao didn’t look flustered at all. Huo Yuhao’s soul ring, which was only a ten year soul ring, had already surprised her immensely. As she watched Wang Dong approach them, she decided to make a move too.</p>
 <p>She pointed her right hand towards Wang Dong, causing the one-metre wide cauldron above her to charge forwards. It didn’t head straight towards Wang Dong, but towards the only path that he could take. Furthermore, she similarly used an innate skill that belonged to her martial soul: she delayed the use of her soul skill.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was put into an extremely difficult position due to the position of the enormous black cauldron, as it was currently flying directly towards the only path that he could take. This was definitely a clever application of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing, no doubt. If not for Huo Yuhao’s help, Xiao Xiao would have had to rely on her eyesight and the fluctuations in Wang Dong’s soulforce to make a judgement, which definitely wouldn’t have been as accurate as right now.</p>
 <p>In this moment of helplessness, Wang Dong suddenly contracted his left wing. This allowed his body to twist slightly in midair, slightly changing his trajectory. However, he became even more depressed when the black cauldron instantly shifted, allowing it to continue blocking him.</p>
 <p>Foresight.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao subconsciously turned to glance at the golden-eyed Huo Yuhao. With his Spiritual Detection Sharing, she didn’t even need to look at Wang Dong. She only needed to follow the instructions of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing to continue her attacks. This couldn’t be any easier for her.</p>
 <p>However, Wang Dong wouldn’t simply admit defeat; he continued to flap his wings as he soared through the air, increasing his speed by several times. Despite this, Huo Yuhao was still able to sense the rotation of his soulforce via his Spiritual Detection, thus he was able to consistently predict his movements. For him to attempt to avoid Xiao Xiao’s Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron while it was under her control clearly wasn’t realistic.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong felt depressed. He couldn’t help but shout, “Huo Yuhao, you’re inhumane! Fine, I won’t dodge—I’ll force my way in!”</p>
 <p>His first soul ring suddenly lit up as he spoke, while the golden light in Huo Yuhao’s eyes suddenly lit up as well. With his Spiritual Detection, he could clearly sense that the soulforce within Wang Dong’s body was rotating in an explosive manner, surging madly into his front pair of wings. On the other hand, his rear wings had been spread out for the sole sake of maintaining his balance.</p>
