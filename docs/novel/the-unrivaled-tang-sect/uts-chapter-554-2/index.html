 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Chief Minister didn’t have any good ideas, so he pushed all the responsibility to Ju Zi. His analysis was also very logical. That’s why his idea wasn’t a reflection of his abilities, but how he was very politically intelligent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the Chief Minister’s expression changed when he heard his words. However, he couldn’t rebut him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, the Death God Douluo Ye Xishui also furrowed her brow. After this, she slowly nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They only agreed with the Military Chief’s words because Ju Zi was both loyal to the empire and also very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was the one who had led the empire to victory over the Heavenly Soul Empire. Ye Xishui had joined in that operation too. After attacking the Ming Dou Mountain Range, she suddenly turned back and assaulted the Heavenly Soul Empire. At the same time, all information was sealed. This series of missions was part of the fighting strategy that had played a very crucial role in the war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, the Sun Moon Empire was relentless, and occupied most parts of the Heavenly Soul Empire. Some people even commented that the Sun Moon Empire would have dominated the entire continent by now if not for the fact that the War God Empress was pregnant with the Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Xu Tianran listened to the Military Chief, he appeared much more cheerful.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! It’s necessary to get Ju Zi’s opinion right now. After all, she’s the one in control of the front lines. She’ll know how to deal with the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran turned to Kong Deming and asked, “Elder Kong, what suggestions do you have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming said, “Our enemies were also a little lucky to have successfully pulled off their attacks. At the same time, they must have known that the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion is not in Radiant City from some unknown channel. If you want me to judge the situation, I believe that our enemies might not just possess concealment abilities, but also spatial abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Spatial abilities?” After hearing these two words, Xu Tianran was astonished. So was Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone else said this, they would laugh it off. However, Kong Deming was different. He was currently the person with the most expertise in soul tool research.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for spatial abilities, only Ye Xishui among everybody present could be associated with it. Only an Ultimate Douluo could really develop any kind of spatial abilities. Even Kong Deming couldn’t. There was also an unbridgeable gap between current soul tool technology and spatial abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ye Yulin listened to Kong Deming’s words, he seemed to be very pensive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran said, “Elder Kong, please be more specific.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming nodded and said, “Little Ye just recounted the entire story, but he missed out one point. He thought that the enemies are two soul engineer legions. However, he only saw one legion retreating. What about the other legion then? The other soul engineer legion should be the one firing all the shells. From the fired shells, I believe they came from Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons, which are manufactured by the Tang Sect. We’ve also obtained Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons from the Heavenly Soul Empire. I’ve taken a simple look at them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The internal structure of the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons manufactured by the Tang Sect is very exquisite, but these cannons have self-destruction components. I couldn’t really examine them well. There are some elements of non-core formations that were used in these cannons. I believe this is the reason for the Tang Sect’s meteoric rise. Such Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons can continuously fire shells, and the number of shells that can be fired is great. However, they aren’t small. Given this, they’ll need a large number of such cannons if tens of thousands of shells are to be fired. This is very important. They were only able to suppress us because they had so many shells. They should have more than a hundred Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons. If they want to retreat, they can’t possibly do it with just a single individual’s concealment soul skill. Even an Ultimate Douluo can’t do that. This is why I believe they must possess some kind of spatial ability, which allows for the rapid shifting of all these soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was horrified. “Don’t tell me there’s a spatial soul tool? How is that possible? Even you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming gestured and said, “I’ve indeed not researched any soul tools related to spatial abilities, but I can’t be sure that there’s no talent in this world who’s capable of doing it. However, from the current situation and the foundation of soul tool technology that’s currently present, I believe it’s difficult for spatial soul tools to have been invented. After all, spatial storage is already the limit. The transport of people, and at such a large scale, is yet to exist. We have to investigate this matter carefully. If it’s really a spatial soul tool, we must risk everything to obtain it. That’ll be very significant to the development of our soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran nodded and said, “What do you suggest then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming said, “Let’s report the situation to the War God Empress first. If the Supreme Worshipped is right, Huo Yuhao is likely to be the one responsible for the spatial soul tool, or for concealing two soul engineer legions. We must bring him here and make him confess everything. I’m also very interested in this young man, who has invented Spirits and established the Spirit Pagoda. There’s one thing the Death God Douluo was right about. This young man is bound to be our nemesis in the future. If we can’t win him over, we must get rid of him quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a loud boom suddenly sounded from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming subconsciously blocked Xu Tianran, and bright green light immediately covered both of them. The other soul engineers present also quickly reacted. They instantly unleashed their strongest defensive-type soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earlier attack left them extremely alarmed. This sudden boom scared them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Yulin’s expression changed. “The sound came from the soul formation that previously belonged to our enemies. Don’t tell me they’re back?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming furrowed his brow. “No. The sound doesn’t seem right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a matter of seconds, news was transmitted over. The soul formation, where many soul tools were left over, experienced a chain explosion. All the remaining soul tools were completely blown apart. In addition, it was also learned that those soul tools all came from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran almost spat out blood again. He immediately dismissed the meeting. He wanted to write a letter to the War God Empress personally. At the same time, martial law was imposed. There were strict checks to sieve out any possible enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Radiant City was on high alert, the atmosphere in the spectral demiplane was very joyous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three hundred Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons were all successfully brought back. Even though they fired more than half their remaining stock of soul cannon shells and caused very little damage to the Sun Moon Empire, they still managed to achieve their strategic goal. The depletion of material resources was nothing compared to the success of their strategic plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After meditating for an entire day, Huo Yuhao finally recovered to his peak state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without even guessing, he knew that the surrounding atmosphere in Radiant City was very tense. He didn’t rush to go out either. After Bei Bei heard that he was awake, he immediately called for a meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, there was no aura of death in the spectral demiplane. The three soul engineer legions were all celebrating. It was no wonder they were like that. Although they had fired many soul cannon shells this time, they were fighting Radiant City! It was the core of their enemies’ backyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had managed to escape completely unharmed in such a fight. It was unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion or the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, they all gained invaluable experience during this fight. Even though it wasn’t a direct clash, the atmosphere had been very tense. Huo Yuhao’s commandeering had left a deep impression on the soul engineers in these two soul engineer legions. It was also very beneficial to their future development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a delightful smile on his face. He clasped his palms in front of his chest. As he looked at his teammates sitting around him, he greeted them before taking a seat beside Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also came with him, and sat beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was all smiles right now. “Alarm bells should be ringing for the Sun Moon Empire this time. Our experiment has also succeeded. It’s just that we don’t how Xu Tianran is. We don’t know if he’s been killed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and answered, “I’m afraid not. There are many defensive installations in the imperial palace, along with many soul engineers. It might still be possible if it were before they researched human-shaped soul tools. However, the possibility is very low right now. It seems like Xu Tianran has many defensive-type soul tools on him, which protect him very well. However, I don’t believe that we’ve not had any influence over him. We bombed the palace this time. I wonder what their reaction will be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi laughed, “The best situation is if they pull their people back from the front lines. In that case, we’ll have achieved our goal. Furthermore, we can continue to cause trouble in the Sun Moon Empire in the future, restraining and weakening them. In the near future, we might even bring the Sun Moon Empire down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei snapped, “If it were that easy, would our empire be in so much torment? After the attack on Radiant City, they’ll definitely target us. The Sun Moon Empire is technologically advanced. They might research soul tools to target us specifically. Yuhao, that’s why you shouldn’t enter Radiant City anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned. Bei Bei had rejected the suggestion that he was about to propose. He laughed bitterly. “Eldest senior, how did you know what I planned to do? I only want to see how we’ve fared. At the same time, I want to know more about the situation at the front lines. After all, information should flow most smoothly in Radiant City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei shook his head determinedly and said, “Our operation was already very dangerous. I can’t let you continue to take risks. What’ve we achieved is already very good. Under such a circumstance, we must try to stabilize our situation first. If we want to obtain intelligence, I’d rather we waste more time trying to gather it at the front lines. After all, given your speed, you can fly there and back in a day. We can’t touch Radiant City anymore. There are too many strong people there. If things go awry, you might be trapped. Then, all we’ve done will go to waste.”</span></p>
