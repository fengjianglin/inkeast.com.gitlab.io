 <p><strong>Book 7: The Extreme North</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 42.2: Creating God?</strong></p>
 <p>Even though Huo Yuhao didn’t expect to simply soar into the heavens with a single step because of this, he would still no longer be a simple control-type soul master who had no combat strength once the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion became his martial soul. On the contrary, he would become a powerful dual-attributed control and assault-type soul master. It didn’t matter what soul skill the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion gave him, as it would definitely be a tyrannically offensive skill! After all, her strength had allowed her to become one of the Three Emperors of the Extreme North. Furthermore, since she was a hundred thousand year soul beast, she was also guaranteed to give him a soul bone.</p>
 <p>How could Huo Yuhao not feel excited about this?</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm struck while the iron was hot, “How about it? You have to clearly think this through. You also can’t miss this opportunity, as this chance definitely won’t come again. I’m also no longer the original me. However, if you don’t agree to my suggestion, I’ll have no choice but to turn you into a regular soul ring, both for the sake of my own immortality, and to make my master stronger. Only, if that happens, you’ll lose your intelligence. You should know that I have several different ways to kill you now that I’ve trapped you. At most, I’ll just have to waste some time to do so. On one hand, you have a chance at immortality. On the other hand, you have definite destruction. You’d best think carefully about which path you want to take.”</p>
 <p>His words undoubtedly carried a threat within them. However, the world of soul beasts was different than that of humans. More often than not, directly threatening the other party would bring about better results in a negotiation between soul beasts. The Skydream Iceworm had lived for a million years, and even though the first nine hundred thousand years of his life were as blank as sheet of paper due to his slumber, the amount of fighting and scheming he’d undergone due to the powerful soul beasts within the Great Star Dou Forest wasn’t small. He’d undergone god-knows how many tribulations while attempting to escape with his life intact, all of which had strengthened his craftiness and intellect.</p>
 <p>“Do I have any other choice?” The Ice Empress replied in an indifferent tone. Despite her tone however, her dense killing intent and chilliness had already decreased by a large amount. She was clearly trying to reach a compromise. Although she’d have to give up her freedom in for this chance at achieving immortality, living was still much better than dying—especially to a soul beast like her, who’d already lived for nearly four hundred thousand years.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm let out a large sigh of relief. “It’s no wonder that you’re the Bingbing I love the most. In the future, you’ll definitely be delighted by the choice you’ve made today.”</p>
 <p>The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion angrily replied, “Skydream, if a piece of trash like you dares to take advantage of this old woman, I’ll see to it that you two follow each other to the grave, even if it means risking my life to do so. I don’t believe that I won’t be able to destroy this cage of yours if I self-destruct. If that happens, you two will have no choice but to accompany me to my death. I’m fine with creating a God with you, but I have a request: Don’t speak so much bullshit.”</p>
 <p>“Err… you don’t have to be this merciless. I really came here just for you….”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress looked at him coldly, but remained silent.</p>
 <p>“Alright fine, I agree. Release your spiritual origin for me. You can’t just hope that I’ll release you like this. That temper of yours doesn’t reassure anyone.”</p>
 <p>Even though the Skydream Iceworm had been shooting his mouth off, he was still an extremely careful person. The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s strength ranked her second in the entire Extreme North—how could releasing her be an option? The risks were too high if he did that. At the same time, the Skydream Iceworm wasn’t worried about the her self-destructing like she’d mentioned earlier. A soul beast would almost always choose the path of survival, so long as there was even a trace of a chance that they would.</p>
 <p>A trace of hesitation appeared in the Ice Empress’ eyes. The second she released her spiritual origin, with the disparity in spiritual power between her and the Skydream Iceworm, there would be no way for her to back out. If the Skydream Iceworm was lying to her, she’d have no hope of turning the tables.</p>
 <p>When he saw the doubt in her eyes, the Skydream Iceworm solemnly said, “Almighty Ice God, I, the Skydream Iceworm, vow on the name of Ice that I shall be stripped of all my Ice if I lie to the Ice Empress and don’t help her become an intelligent soul ring once she releases her spiritual origin.”</p>
 <p>This vow didn’t seem to hold much meaning to Huo Yuhao, but the Ice Empress didn’t have the same view; in the Extreme North, this was the most important vow a soul beast could make.</p>
 <p>“Fine, I believe you.” As someone who had become one of the Extreme North’s Three Emperors, the Ice Empress was capable of killing without sparing a second thought. After hesitating for a brief moment, she decided. After all, the current Skydream Iceworm had already lost his body. Besides, it was just like he’d said: It wasn’t an impossibility for her to be reborn from the ashes. Furthermore, she’d always known that the Skydream Iceworm liked her. After considering several factors, she finally confirmed her decision.</p>
 <p>Her crystalline yellow pupils gradually turned jade-green, while her long, jade-green tail suddenly rose into the air. This was something that she was only able to do after the Skydream Iceworm had loosened her bindings.</p>
 <p>A soft, jade-green halo began to undulate from the root of her tail, then moved backwards and gathered at the tip of her tail. In a flash of jade-green light, small, jade-green balls of light began to separate from one another as they slowly rising into the air. At the same time, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s eyes immediately lost their luster and dimmed.</p>
 <p>This was her spiritual origin.</p>
 <p>Even though the process of releasing one’s spiritual origin seemed simple, not just any soul beast could do it. Only when a soul beast broke through their limits and reaching the hundred thousand year rank could they do such a thing. Of course, it naturally didn’t pose any problems to unrivalled experts such as the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.</p>
 <p>After letting out a large sigh of relief, the Skydream Iceworm’s own golden ball of light immediately glided forward and glued itself to his shedded skin. The golden light increased in size the instant the jade-green ball of light made contact with it as it swallowed the jade-green ball of light like a whale swallowing its food. After swallowing the jade-green ball of light, it returned to Huo Yuhao’s body and re-entered it via his forehead. Afterwards, the Skydream Iceworm’s shedded skin rapidly retreated back into Huo Yuhao’s semi-frozen body.</p>
 <p>After losing her spiritual origin, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s main body fell to the ground. With her spiritual origin no longer controlling it, her body immediately began to release an extremely terrifying amount of murderous might, while a jade-green luster simultaneously appeared in the sky. It could be imagined how terrifying the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion was from this.</p>
 <p>“I’m freezing to death.” Huo Yuhao involuntarily shivered.</p>
 <p>“Skydream, you really made a poor choice. He’s just as trashy as you. Do you actually want him to receive my power with such a weak body? Do you really think that such a thing is possible?” The Ice Empress’ disdainful voice rang out after she appeared in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao suddenly had a strange thought in his mind. With the Skydream Iceworm, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, the gray elder, and himself… there were now enough people to set up a mahjong table in his spiritual sea. It would be really lively in his spiritual sea!</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm chortled. “Ice Empress, there’s no need to be so impatient. If you’d died, it would’ve naturally been impossible for him to absorb your martial soul. With his current body, even a thousand year soul ring could cause his body to explode, not to mention someone like you who’s nearly reached four hundred thousand years of cultivation. However, the situation is completely different since you and I are helping him out! Will we really let him fail just like that?”</p>
