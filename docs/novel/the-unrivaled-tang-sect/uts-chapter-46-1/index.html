 <p><strong>Book 8: Advancing to the Second Year</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 46.1: The Spirit Eyes' Second Soul Skill</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded. A pale golden light flickered through his eyes as he released his Spirit Eyes. When he did, a white and purple soul ring rose up from his feet.</p>
 <p>Astonishment once again appeared on Fan Yu, Zhou Yi, and Wang Dong’s faces,</p>
 <p>A thousand year soul ring, another thousand year soul ring. The second soul ring of Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes was actually another thousand year soul ring. Just what had he done during the past month!? Under a situation in which he didn’t even have a single attacking soul skill, he’d actually obtained a thousand year soul ring. This was simply too inconceivable.</p>
 <p>“A thousand year soul ring? You, how did your body endure it?” A puzzled look filled Zhou Yi’s face, “If it was already somewhat fishy that you were able to obtain a soul ring for your second martial soul, just how in the world did you get that thousand year soul ring for your Spirit Eyes? Don’t tell me that you also got it after sleeping for a while. If that’s the case, I’ll go run to the North and sleep there every day.”</p>
 <p>Somewhat embarrassed, Huo Yuhao said, “I didn’t get it just by sleeping. I killed a soul beast, then discovered that it had a spiritual attribute to it. After that, I absorbed its soul ring. I didn’t even know that it was a thousand year soul ring. As for why I could endure it, it seems to be because I’ve obtained a soul bone…”</p>
 <p>The trio’s facial muscles twitched simultaneously.</p>
 <p>Two thousand year soul rings and a soul bone? Did Huo Yuhao fall into a treasury?</p>
 <p>Fan Yu said, “Carefully explain everything to us. Just what in the world happened?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded obediently. “I really got that soul bone after waking up. It seems to be related to the Ice Jade Scorpion; it’s a torso bone. I discovered that after I pour soul power into my backbone, I can emit an extremely intense chilliness. However, this can only be maintained for a very short time before my soul power’s fully drained. After killing that soul beast, I directly started to absorb it. This was because I didn’t know it was a thousand year one. By the time I noticed that the soul ring coming from its body was a purple one, it was too late. In the end, I finished absorbing it without feeling much pain. Could it be because the soul bone strengthened my physique?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi nodded. “It’s possible. Tell us the important part of this story; tell us how you killed that thousand year soul beast. Even three-ringed students might not be able to easily kill a thousand year soul beast, but you were only a one-ringed Soul Master at that time.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “The soul beast I encountered was very strange. When I first bumped into it, it was a fierce, snow-white tiger. It seemed extraordinarily strong, and I knew that it wasn’t something to be trifled with at first glance. I didn’t even have any thoughts of fighting with it! Thus, I turned around and ran away. After I ran a long distance away, I turned around. I discovered that it hadn’t chased after me; it was only looking at me. At that time, I felt that it was very strange, as tiger-type soul beasts are extremely aggressive. This point was especially emphasized during our classes. However, why didn’t it take the initiative to attack me? Because of that, I mustered some courage to quietly return and observe it. In the end, I discovered that the tiger was still looking at me, but it didn’t have any intentions of making a move. Then, I tried using a long-range soul tool to attack it. But, who would’ve predicted that the tiger’s body would suddenly turn illusory, causing my attack to miss? Right after that, it charged towards me.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, I felt that I was definitely screwed. I didn’t even have enough time to regret my actions, and I ran away again. However, that tiger was much faster than me. Within a few moments, it caught up to me and pounced towards me viciously. Panicked, I released that Scorpion martial soul and blocked it with my hand. My body sank, and I fell down. Because I thought that I was finished, I subconsciously grabbed the throat of that tiger. That white tiger also attacked me, and it even released a spiritual attack. However, I had my Spirit Eyes! Though I felt waves of dizziness from its spiritual attack, I didn’t suffer any real injuries. By the time I woke up from its spiritual attack, I discovered that the soul beast I’d grabbed was actually not the white tiger; instead, it’d turned into an enormous worm. It was a full meter long, and its entire body was snow-white and translucent. Oh, right. It was just like an especially large silkworm. After using that Scorpion martial soul, I felt that I’d become extraordinarily strong. That large silkworm seemed to have been crushed to death by me. I didn’t think much of it then. After all, spiritual-type soul beasts aren’t easy to find in the first place. Since I was able to bump into one, I hurriedly absorbed it. Then, I obtained this thousand year soul ring.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong asked, suspicious, “What you’re saying is too farfetched. Why was it a tiger, then a large silkworm all of a sudden?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao gave a mysterious smile, “Originally, I thought the same as you. However, I understood everything after trying out the new soul skill I obtained. Teachers, please take a look at this.”</p>
 <p>With that, the hint of golden light in Huo Yuhao’s eyes suddenly intensified. Instantly, the purple soul ring around him blossomed with a dazzling light. He quickly took a step backwards, arriving next to Wang Dong. Right after that, Fan Yu and Zhou Yi astonishedly discovered that there were unexpectedly two Wang Dong’s in front of them; there was no longer a Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Turning towards the ‘Wang Dong’ beside him, Wang Dong was immediately gobsmacked, “This, what is this skill?”</p>
 <p>A distorted halo of light flickered slightly on ‘Wang Dong’s body, and he turned back into Huo Yuhao. Right after that, Huo Yuhao revealed another astonishing scene. The rhythmically undulating soul rings around his body transformed yet again.</p>
 <p>The originally white and purple soul rings instantly transformed into two blood-red soul rings which were filled with a terrifying aura. The pressure that suddenly appeared caused even Fan Yu and Zhou Yi to subconsciously release their own soul rings while quickly retreating backwards.</p>
 <p>“Hundred, hundred thousand year soul rings?” Wang Dong blurted out involuntarily. His reaction wasn’t as violent as those of the two teachers. The martial soul fusion that he had with Huo Yuhao caused him to be unable to sense any danger from the two hundred thousand year soul rings.</p>
 <p>The lights changed yet again, and the two terrifying blood-red soul rings transformed again. This time around, they turned into a weak white color that represented the white of a ten year soul ring.</p>
 <p>The gap between a hundred thousand year soul ring and a ten year soul ring was quite large.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao smiled mischievously. “This is my all-new spiritual-type skill; my thousand year soul skill: Imitation. By using my spiritual undulations, it can bend space and allow me to imitate various shapes. However, the range of my Imitation can’t exceed a diameter of three meters. Imitation gives me another special ability--that is, the ability to change the color of my soul ring as I wish. Though it doesn’t possess any attacking abilities, it should be quite useful if I use it well.”</p>
 <p>Right, this was the second soul skill of Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes. The story he’d just told wasn’t a full lie; the way he’d obtained this second soul ring wasn’t much different from how he’d narrated it. Only, the Iceworm he’d killed had been found by the Skydream Iceworm. Moreover, it was the Skydream Iceworm who’d exposed the other Iceworm’s illusory imitation.</p>
 <p>The race the Skydream Iceworm was most familiar with was undoubtedly his own race! This Imitation skill seemed powerless, but it was the Iceworm’s best life-protecting measure. This skill was especially important to the current Huo Yuhao. With his Imitation, he could arbitrarily change the colors of his soul rings, allowing him to reveal the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s first soul skill without being scared of anything. This was also why the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s soul ring had been purple when it had appeared earlier.</p>
 <p>“Nice, nice imitation.” In what was practically an instant, Fan Yu’s eyes lit up. As a powerful soul engineer, he immediately thought of a few effective uses of this skill within the domain of soul engineers. More importantly, he could conceal Huo Yuhao’s abilities to an even greater degree with this skill!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Huo Yuhao was astonished as well. This was because of the number of soul rings surrounding Teacher Fan Yu.</p>
 <p>There were two yellow rings, two purple rings, and four black rings, totalling eight soul rings. The merely forty-or-so year-old teacher was unexpectedly a powerful Soul Douluo, an eight-ringed Soul Douluo! With his teacher’s age, it wasn’t an impossibility for him to charge towards the Titled Douluo realm.</p>
 <p>Fan Yu spoke with a low voice. “Yuhao, Teacher needs you to give me an answer right now. Will you choose to remain in the Martial Soul Department, or will we announce that you are a core disciple of the Soul Tool Department?”</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation at all, Huo Yuhao knelt down again. Respectfully, he said, “A teacher for one day, a father forever. Teacher, I am willing to continue studying soul tools with you.”</p>
 <p>“Good, good.” Fan Yu was overjoyed. Stepping forward, he propped Huo Yuhao up. “Good child. Since that’s the case, your teacher has to issue you a command. Since you have this soul skill, you should use it. From now on, regardless of whether you are participating in the academy’s assessments or interacting with the other students, you have to use your Imitation to change the color of your soul rings to white.” With that, the hint of a naughty smile appeared in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi said unhappily, “Are you teaching him how to eat a tiger by disguising himself as a pig?”</p>
 <p>Fan Yu smiled slightly, “Is there anything bad about that? Those old fellas from your Martial Soul Department are each shrewder than the other. If they were to learn the truth, would they not try to steal him from us?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi asked, doubtful, “Didn’t Dean Qian win his bet with Dean Yan? Would Dean Qian renege on his deal?”</p>
 <p>Fan Yu laughed coldly. “Is there anything he won’t do? In front of an outstanding student, what do bets count for? Even if Dean Yan always has a solemn appearance, he can twist his words from black to white for the sake of the Martial Soul Department’s strength. You’ve always thought that Dean Qian was very crafty, right? But, Dean Qian is still a ways off from Dean Yan. Caution is always the path to safety. Wang Dong, you have to keep this a secret as well. Otherwise, you’ll be making enemies, even within our Soul Tool Department. Let’s do it this way; you two can go back to your dorms first, and let me take care of this matter. Yuhao, you’ll have to remain in the Martial Soul Department and learn some foundational knowledge until you graduate from Year 3, at the very least. Because of this, even if I announce the fact that you’re a core disciple of the Soul Tool Department, you can’t be arrogant. You have to continue learning in a steadfast manner in the Martial Soul Department.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Teacher.”</p>
 <p>This ordeal could be considered to have been crossed. Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but inwardly let out a long sigh.</p>
