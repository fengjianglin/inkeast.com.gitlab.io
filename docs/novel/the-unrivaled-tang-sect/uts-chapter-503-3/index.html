 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Huo Yuhao returned to his room, he first tried to determine the position of the sun.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s still morning, less than two hours to noon. It seems like eldest senior deliberately asked second senior to call me so that I’d have time to tidy myself up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A set of brand new clothes was laid on the table in the room. Huo Yuhao quickly took a hot bath, and afterwards all his fatigue seemed to have disappeared. Given his current cultivation, he was fine even if he didn’t sleep for a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just when he had finished showering and was prepared to put on his clothes, he suddenly heard an anxious voice calling him in his head.“Yuhao, Yuhao!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress’ call jolted Huo Yuhao awake. He hurriedly asked, “What’s wrong, Ice Empress?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A white light flashed, and the Snow Empress appeared in front of him. She appeared very anxious, “Where’s Little Bai? When he was still in your demiplane, I had already sensed something amiss. Quickly, let him out. I’m afraid he might face a bottleneck soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao was given a scare. The Ice Bear King and Snow Empress were closely connected. The Snow Empress had saved him, and transferred some of her abilities to him. This was how he became the Ice Bear King. They had a tight connection. If the Snow Empress said something like this, she must have discovered something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to delay any further. He quickly recited a few incantations and opened the door that led to his demiplane. He entered the demiplane along with the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he came in, he was completely shocked. There was an unprecedented change in his demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire sky was dark and gloomy. Bolts of lightning intersected in the sky. Immense pressure bore down from the skies, suppressing the countless specters on the ground. Some of the stronger ones roared at the bolts of lightning, as if they were trying to resist the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King was standing on a mountain, just standing there quietly. Right now, he appeared very calm. He was still in his human form, and there were still some food scraps on the sides of his lips. His gaze was deep and long. There was even a sense of self-mockery and disdain to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he stood there, he really seemed to have become the core of the entire demiplane at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck down from the sky onto Little Bai’s head. Little Bai roared furiously, and his hair all stood on end. A layer of icy-blue light surfaced to resist the lightning. As it clashed with the bolt of lightning, the lightning dissipated, and Little Bai’s body shook a little. There was an electrifying look in his eyes after this happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” Huo Yuhao was astonished as he watched beside the Snow Empress. The Snow Empress appeared very serious and said, “It’s started, it’s actually started. I didn’t expect your demiplane to be so close to reality, a Lightning Catastrophe can actually happen here! This is a catastrophe that soul beasts have to face every hundred thousand years. Although the catastrophe faced by each soul beast is different, it is without a doubt that a Lightning Catastrophe is the most dangerous. No wonder I always had this feeling that Little Bai wouldn’t be able to survive this catastrophe. It’s actually a Lightning Catastrophe!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked, “What should we do now? Can we help him resist the Lightning Catastrophe?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress shook her head and replied, “No, you can’t. You’ll only be courting death. Your cultivation is too weak. If I still had my original body, we might still stand a chance. However, it’s not possible, I’m only a spiritual entity now. I’m afraid of lightning. I’ll also be courting death if I go and help him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao anxiously asked, “Don’t tell me that we can only watch? What if he dies if he can’t resist it anymore? Is there no way at all?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, another bolt of lightning struck. Little Bai found it more difficult to resist the lightning this time. Not only did he stagger, but he also returned to his original form. A patch of hair on his shoulders had already been charred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have no other way right now,” the Snow Empress said decisively. “We can only leave him to it. This fellow is too greedy. If he had returned to the Douluo Continent with you, we would have known about any catastrophe before it arrived. However, he can’t sense anything here, he can only suffer. If he’s able to hold on, that’ll be great. Even if he can’t, he won’t be completely decimated. As long as a streak of his spiritual sense is left, we can still transform it and bring him back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at the Snow Empress. He was helpless right now. The Snow Empress had experienced such a catastrophe seven times. She was more experienced, and he could only listen to her advice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the lightning was only targeting Little Bai. The sky was getting darker and darker. Thick clouds were gathering above the mountain. If the lightning targeted the specters, this demiplane would surely be ravaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM! BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two consecutive bolts of lightning struck. Little Bai summoned his soul power to its maximum, and an icy-blue shield surfaced above his head, resisting those two bolts of lightning. However, Huo Yuhao could clearly sense Little Bai’s aura growing weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power of lightning was great, and contained the natural qi of heaven and earth. Huo Yuhao felt as if his body had been baptized by the thunderous natural qi when he felt it so close to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai peered into the sky and roared. His massive body squirmed a little. Following this, a beam of icy-blue light shot into the sky, charging straight for the clouds. Instantly, everything within a region spanning a thousand meters in diameter was turned into ice and snow. Snowflakes danced in the air, and the temperature fell dramatically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t harmed even though he was in this region, since his martial soul was Ultimate Ice, and he also had the Snow Empress with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai was retaliating. Huo Yuhao opened his eyes wide to see what Little Bai had achieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth, however, was that Little Bai’s attack wasn’t very effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bolts of lightning struck down and dismantled the beam of light that he unleashed. Even though there was still a streak of light that hit the clouds, weakening them, Little Bai’s body was already shaking uncontrollably as the streak of light dissipated. The soul power undulations that came from his body had weakened considerably, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The earlier attack was already his strongest strike. Huo Yuhao and the Snow Empress rushed over. The Ice Bear King had already been facing the lightning for some time. His soul power was almost drained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The clouds seemed to be infuriated. Bolts of lightning struck towards Little Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai didn’t appear to be out of hope when he peered into the sky. There was only a persistent look on his face. An icy-blue whirlpool slowly appeared on his forehead. The surrounding air currents seemed to undulate tremendously, and the bolts of lightning were resisted just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao saw a core shaped like a snowflake at the center of that rapidly spinning whirlpool. It was Little Bai’s soul core. It turned out that one’s soul core could be used like that...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao saw the soul core, he heaved a sigh of relief. This was power that only a Titled Douluo or a hundred-thousand-year soul beast possessed! He and his teammates had killed Titled Douluo before. However, they were always very fortunate. If the Titled Douluo they had killed had unleashed their soul cores, their fighting strength would have been significantly greater. However, Huo Yuhao could tell that this was Little Bai’s last resort. Once his soul core was damaged, his life would be in great danger, and his cultivation would fall significantly. He might even completely lose his cultivation. It was why Titled Douluo rarely relied on the strength of their soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To Huo Yuhao, observing this fight was a good way of accumulating experience. Personally witnessing a soul beast overcoming a catastrophe was very rare among human soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom, boom, boom, boom!...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bolts of lightning continued to fall. Little Bai’s soul core was still capable of resisting them initially. However, his aura gradually started to weaken, and his soul core started to shake unstably. Given his condition, the strength of his soul core couldn’t completely protect his body anymore. Patches of black started to appear on his body. He was also forced to sit on the ground by the lightning striking him. His gaze was also becoming dimmer and dimmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet another ball of lightning struck. Little Bai was flung into the air as an explosion reverberated across the demiplane. The air currents surrounding his soul core instantly disappeared, leaving his soul core exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little Bai!” Huo Yuhao screamed. He sprinted forward without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, don’t go!” The Snow Empress didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to be so quick. She was already too late before she could stop him. Huo Yuhao instantly teleported above Little Bai. He mimicked a lifting action, and his immense Ultimate Ice soul power was unleashed from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another ball-shaped bolt of lightning formed in the sky and crashed down toward Little Bai, Huo Yuhao placed himself between the ball of lightning and Little Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a decisive look in his eyes. He knew that what he was doing was dangerous. However, if he didn’t do this, he wouldn’t be able to forgive himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t forget how Little Bai had accompanied him and called him “Grandpa”. Without Little Bai, he wouldn’t have been able to breach Heaven Dou City. Without Little Bai, he wouldn’t have been able to resist Ju Zi, or sneak into the Sun Moon Empire’s base.</span></p>
