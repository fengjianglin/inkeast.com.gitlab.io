<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was, in fact, the northernmost part of the northern area! Even though it was not as cold as the Extreme North Ice Field, it was way colder than anywhere else. Also, the Ice Sea was just outside of Eastern Sun City. There was plenty of water in the Ice Sea, so there would not be any problem with the water element here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao first came here, he predicted that his power should increase by at least twenty percent here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong was shielding the blows for him, Huo Yuhao had already used his Spiritual Detection to scan the battlefield. He now had a complete picture of the battlefield, and had already established contact with He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything was under control. After confirming that no other accidents would happen, he naturally would not go light on the enemy as he unleashed his true fighting power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After returning to Huo Yuhao’s side, Tang Wutong opened up her butterfly wings and protected his back. This time around, Huo Yuhao was at the front, and Tang Wutong was like a little bird as she hugged his waist from the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Tang Wutong’s seal were to act up now, it would truly be a tragedy. However, she had long thought of this. Because she was wearing the Dragon God Armor, her body would not come into direct contact with Huo Yuhao. This meant that the seal would naturally not act up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned an ice-blue color as he faced the avenging spirits that were swarming towards him. Even though he was just standing there calmly, those spirits were unable to get near him and Tang Wutong. They were stuck outside of a five-meter radius around the couple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao unleashed the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, the entire area where the soul tools were installed started to experience a plunge in temperature. Because this area had activated their linked defense system, the cold air was trapped inside. Hence, the rate at which the temperature was dropping was faster than usual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul engineers who were trying to put up a struggle experienced a huge drop in their fighting power because of the extreme cold. Even though Ji Juechen and the others would also be affected by the cold, they were much stronger, and thus were not affected as much as the soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this very instant, a loud cry could be heard. Following which, a pure white figure dashed out from the corner of the soul tool formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the avenging spirits were spirits, they were also similar to packets of energy, and were affected by the extremely low temperature. Their flying speed and fighting power were also heavily reduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this streak of white light emerged, the neighboring avenging spirits let out a deafening scream as they scrambled away from the white light in fear. As long as they came into contact with the white light, the avenging spirit would disintegrate. There was no chance for them to withstand the power of the white light. The Myriad Soul Domain no longer had any positive effects on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the pure white figure floated in mid-air, a pair of white wings opened up behind her back. The figure was wielding a white sword in her hands. She was none other than Ye Guyi—the cultivator with the Holy Angel martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After controlling the situation, the next thing Huo Yuhao wanted to do was maximize profits. He not only wanted to make sure he maximized the number of spoils he could take away from this area, but he also wanted his peers to maximize what they could take away for themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beyond acquiring soul tools and resources here, the one who could stand to gain the most among the Tang Sect was Ye Guyi—the cultivator who was the natural enemy of evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because she possessed the Holy Angel martial soul, she was able to improve her cultivation from killing evil soul masters and destroying their abilities. The Myriad Soul Douluo’s Myriad Soul Banner contained so many avenging spirits. If Yu Guyi were to cleanse and purify all of them, her cultivation would take a huge leap forward. This was why he did not immediately kill the two Titled Douluo evil soul masters. He merely unleashed his domain and competed against them with it. He only wanted to trap the Myriad Soul Douluo to give Ye Guyi a chance to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The avenging spirits had no chance against Ye Guyi as they disintegrated like the grass against a fire. All the avenging spirits were purified by her holy light. During the purification process, the pure energy released flowed into Ye Guyi’s body and continually improved her cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was her first time fighting against evil soul masters since joining the Tang Sect. On top of that, the evil soul master she was facing was a Titled Douluo. With her current ability, she would not have been able to subdue a Titled Douluo even if she was his or her natural enemy. After all, as a Soul Sage, she was a lot weaker than a Soul Douluo. However, with the help of Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong and Er Bai, the odds were actually in her favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she waved the holy sword in her hand, she was almost invincible. As she flickered across the sky, a large amount of avenging spirits were vanquished, and the leftover spirits scattered in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A deafening howl roared through the air. It was the Myriad Soul Douluo screaming in pain. How could he not be anguished by the death of the spirits he had painstakingly accumulated in his Myriad Soul Banner? Not every dead person would produce an avenging spirit. Avenging spirits could only be formed from the death of a person or a beast with immense hatred. And the odds of that were one in ten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo was only able to cultivate to his current level because of the blood and sweat he had shed to accumulate the avenging spirits in his Myriad Soul Banner. He had been staying at Eastern Sun City to target aquatic soul beasts so as to acquire their avenging spirits. This was because the avenging spirits formed from the bodies of the aquatic soul beasts were a great fit for his martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of how Ye Guyi had rampaged around, the Myriad Soul Douluo had lost over a hundred avenging spirits. The spirits were completely purified, and had no chance of reviving. As the number of avenging spirits in his banner decreased, his powers waned. Even though he had over a thousand avenging spirits, he could not sustain this rate of losses for long!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After shouting in pain, the Myriad Soul Douluo increased the power of his Myriad Soul Banner. He steered his avenging spirits away from Ye Guyi and towards the other people, leaving gusts of wind buffeting against her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Ye Guyi was not fighting alone. While she might not be strong enough to fight the Myriad Soul Douluo alone, she had the help of Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao leaned slightly backwards, and a powerful light was released from both his body and Tang Wutong’s. A large eye—the Eye of the Asura—appeared. A Radiant Dragon God's Butterfly danced around the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, countless tiny black hammers were projected at the speed of light in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mantra Amidst the Void, Spiritual Tempest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Tempest was the combination of the Spirit Eyes and the Clear Sky Hammer. It forged and strengthened Huo Yuhao’s immensely powerful spiritual power before releasing it as a devastating blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Martial soul fusion skill! It was a skill which was powerful enough to go up against a technique from a Transcendent Douluo. Back when they were facing more than ten Titled Douluo, Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao had managed to burst through their containment with this skill. The two evil soul masters would probably have no chance against it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spiritual Tempest avoided their own people in a delicate fashion, and attempted to expand its range to envelope their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Abomination Douluo, Myriad Soul Douluo and the avenging spirits released from the Myriad Soul Banner were all enveloped within the Spiritual Tempest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was truly a full power attack released by both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, the avenging spirits that were flying clear of Ye Guyi found themselves frozen in mid-air. Their spiritual fire was solidified and frozen under the effects of Spiritual Tempest. Normally, the tempest would have destroyed a large number of the avenging spirits. However, Huo Yuhao was able to use his exceptional control to control the power of the tempest to create an advantage for Ye Guyi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo and Abomination Douluo both let out a groan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Domain was also destroyed at that instant. Even if the two of them were to go up against Tang Wutong one-on-one, they would still find it hard to beat her. Furthermore, they were actually going up against a skill released by both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, it took only a short while before the outcome of the battle was decided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The biggest winner was naturally Ye Guyi. As she spread out the wings behind her back, she flickered across the sky like a bolt of lightning. Large numbers of avenging spirits were purified wherever her holy sword landed. As the winds of Spiritual Tempest blew through the area, Ye Guyi cleaned up after them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The avenging spirits that were hit by Spiritual Tempest and the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice could not dodge or defend themselves against Ye Guyi. They could only wait for their vengeance to be purified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Domain might be extremely powerful in the eyes of an average soul master. It could not only release tens of thousands of avenging spirits, but also enhance their power exponentially. However as strong as this skill might be, it would only work in Ye Guyi’s favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could sense with his spiritual detection that Ye Guyi’s cultivation was shooting up at an insane rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This could only be a result of the strength of the opponent she was facing. She was going up against a Titled Douluo evil soul master. In addition, he was the kind of soul master who accumulated avenging spirits. He was the perfect target for her to improve her cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past few years, Ye Guyi had never used such a method to improve her cultivation. Her foundation had always been solid and stable. Hence, this was a golden opportunity for her to consume the power of a Titled Douluo. It was impossible for her abilities to not improve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As her cultivation improved, the holy light she was emanating became stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being caught in the spiritual tempest, the Myriad Soul Douluo took seven to eight seconds before he regained his composure from his shock. But when he finally became calm again, he realized he had already come out of his martial soul true body. His Myriad Soul Banner’s color had become a lot fainter, and only the most powerful avenging spirits were left around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Abomination Douluo, he was already pinned down by Er Bai. His back had been crushed, and a thick layer of dense ice had formed on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he stand a chance against Er Bai after suffering from the spiritual tempest? This was like fighting a battle against a combination of a Transcendent Douluo who specialized in spiritual control and a Transcendent Douluo who specialized in assault. Even an evil soul master could not withstand such blows.</span></p>
