 <p><strong>Book 13: Life Gold</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 106.1: The Eye of Life</strong></p>
 <p>The Life Gold before his eyes only nourished his body for an extremely short period of time, but he could clearly feel that the sum of every herbal medicine and tonic he had eaten before were not as effective as that moment he had just experienced. The feeling of sudden and smooth circulation was unprecedented. He was positive that, after this transformation, his cultivation speed would be greatly improved, and his body’s endurance would be boosted as well. His capacity for higher-ranked soul rings would be raised by at least a thousand years, and this meant the power of his soul skills would be raised at the same time.</p>
 <p>Just when Huo Yuhao was at the climax of his exhilaration, the vast aura of life paused as the sensation of comfort and pleasure receded in just a matter of seconds.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was still relishing in his comfort before his entire body started to feel empty. However, his unnaturally sensitive perception immediately told him that something was wrong – he realized, to his shock, that the Soul-Devouring Carving Knife had departed from between his eyebrows. What was more frightening was the fact that the sharp end of the blade was pointed right at his forehead, above his eyebrows.</p>
 <p>Before he could even react, the Soul-Devouring Carving Knife stabbed down ferociously, and the entire blade sunk deep into his skull. Huo Yuhao wanted to scream and struggle under the agonizing pain, but he quickly realized that, to his intense dismay, there was nothing he could do.</p>
 <p>Tremendous volumes of life energy instantly flooded in once the blade entered his skull. His current experience was similar to that of someone who had just eaten a strike of his Spiritual Shock – it felt like he had just been hammered on the head, and his mind was a complete blank.</p>
 <p>It was too late for the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion to save him once they felt everything. The extensive energies of life surged into Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea from his forehead and gave them an inexplicably comfortable sensation as their spiritual origins were rinsed.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea had turned into a green-colored ocean at this point. Dense and thick mists of life energy gradually started to condense, while his spiritual sea began to expand outwards with bedazzling speed.</p>
 <p>Two shadows materialized in his spiritual sea – the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress.</p>
 <p>They glanced at each other, and immediately detected the shock in each other’s eyes. They had been alive for hundreds of thousands of years, and even though Huo Yuhao’s head had just been pierced by the Soul-Devouring Carving Knife, they could feel that Electrolux didn’t harbor evil intentions. Furthermore, that vast pool of life energy that had just poured into Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea, and the process of expansion that was triggered, was greatly beneficial to them.</p>
 <p>The life energy nourished the spiritual sea, and this was equivalent to nourishing their spiritual origins. Therefore, they resolved to calm themselves as they focused on protecting Huo Yuhao’s spiritual origin while paying attention to the changes around them.</p>
 <p>A frail old man clad in white appeared inside Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea between shimmering grey lights.</p>
 <p>He glanced at the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion and smiled as he said, “Big bug, small scorpion – I will not fight with you for territory any longer. You can release a little bit of your sealing power to boost Yuhao’s spiritual sea and raise his spiritual power. His body can be considered pristine and impeccable after this transformation. However, don’t infuse your powers into him too quickly – it’s better to wait for his mastery of soul power to break rank 30 before you two continue fusing with him.”</p>
 <p>Skydream watched him with astonished eyes as he asked, “You’re Electrolux?”</p>
 <p>The old man nodded and replied, “My thread of divine sense had no foundation. It was empty and weak, which meant that it could have dissipated at any moment. However, things are a lot different with this miraculous Life Gold – it can provide me with a vector, and I will be able to sustain myself inside, and this is bound to stabilize my divine sense a little more. However, much of my memory has been lost – too much – and I can only rediscover these memories if my divine sense gets stronger, and so I need Yuhao’s help. You guys can relax – we all share the same goal, and that’s to make him stronger. When the power of his divine sense reaches the level I possessed back in the day, everything I’ve lost will return. Furthermore, I am starting to find this world a lot more interesting ever since fusing myself with his body. I need to be on my way, and you guys can communicate with me through our spiritual origins.”</p>
 <p>Electrolux’s right hand swiped across the air as he spoke, and a green door made of light appeared before him. He waved back at the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress before his shadow vanished into the door.</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress couldn’t help but give praise as she watched Electrolux’s departure. “Such powerful control of his divine sense. This is humankind’s innate talent! I have cultivated for four hundred thousand years, but I don’t think I can condense my spiritual origin enough for it to evolve into divine sense.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm wriggled his body and said, “Don’t worry. We are integrated with Yuhao in order to draw upon his innate talents now. If he can succeed in the future, then we will surely succeed as well.”</p>
 <p>They were still engaged in casual conversation when something insidious started happening to Huo Yuhao’s body.</p>
 <p>The green Soul-Devouring Carving Knife inside his forehead was trembling faintly. However, the gash that was opened by the blade didn’t gush with blood – instead, the Soul-Devouring Carving Knife started to soften, and eventually melted into a green liquid that flowed into Huo Yuhao’s head through the opening.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s entire being was tainted with a thick layer of green as the large volumes of life energy started to wash his body continuously, with his forehead as the central point.</p>
 <p>The wound slashed open by the blade didn’t close up following the fusion of the carving knife. Instead, it began to open even wider under the effects of a circle of green-gold light, much like the mouth of an infant – it also seemed like a single eye.</p>
 <p>His wound quivered, while his muscles and his bones were all being continuously distorted during the process. Huo Yuhao’s body trembled from the effects of the transformation, and that was an excruciating pain that ordinary people wouldn’t be able to tolerate.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s mind had been awake this whole time. He could even hear the conversation between the two powerful soul beasts and Electrolux inside his spiritual sea. However, there was nothing he could do to interrupt the process, or truly understand what was happening to him at this moment.</p>
 <p>The green-gold light gradually stabilized. A single tiny grey pearl materialized at the gash on his forehead and began to fuse intricately with the broken flesh, tendons and bones around the hole.</p>
 <p>The harrowing pain pierced Huo Yuhao’s nerves like countless numbers of needles. The pain he was feeling now was perhaps ten times greater than what he had experienced during his fusion with the bones of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s soul and spiritual origin were screaming incessantly as he felt as if his spiritual origin was being torn apart. One could also say that his spiritual origin was being ripped to shreds before it was pieced back together. That kind of pain was truly indescribable. No matter how vast the pools of life energy were, Huo Yuhao couldn’t feel a single ounce of comfort at this particular moment. The pain he was feeling seemed to drag him into the deepest and darkest abyss, and he was just sinking ever deeper.</p>
 <p>Terrifying ripples of soul power erupted at this moment. Huo Yuhao’s Mysterious Heaven Technique soul power instinctively tried to protect his body, but that soul power had no way of entering this particular region of his spiritual sea.</p>
 <p>An unknown duration of time passed, and just when he was becoming numb to the agonizing pain, and his spiritual origin already felt like it had been torn to pieces, he suddenly felt a trace of light.</p>
 <p>It was a dull, gentle and tender golden color.</p>
 <p>His shattered spiritual origin was seamlessly covered and enveloped by this all-encompassing golden light. That feeling was strange, as if he was thrown into a warm lake, and his fractured spiritual origin was progressively softened and agglutinating within.</p>
 <p>The lake was golden, and glued his spiritual origin back together while it injected a mysterious kind of energy inside.</p>
 <p>The numbness slowly became warmth. Huo Yuhao’s mind was also recuperating along with the convalescence of his spiritual origin.</p>
 <p>He reached out with his senses at once. The first thing he saw was that he was sitting by his bed, cross-legged, and his waist was erect while his entire body was extremely silent. There was suddenly an extra eye on his forehead.</p>
 <p>This eye didn’t radiate with green light, and the socket was a little smaller than his original eyes. There appeared to be faint and pale flickers of green light around the socket.</p>
 <p>The pupil itself was grey. However, there was a subtle flicker of golden light deep within the patches of grey. His strange third eye moved a little, and Huo Yuhao instantly realized that he was staring at himself – he saw the vicissitudes, the abstruseness, and a life and purity that was difficult to describe.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power returned to his body with a whistle. This time, the things he was looking at started to change – he could see his bones, his muscles, and his veins and capillaries.</p>
 <p>The circulation of blood was like a flowing river as it trickled along, and the dense essence of blood was permeated with vigorous life energies. His skeleton, his muscles, his veins and his organs were all covered by strange layers of green, and this layer was currently fusing with his body while its color gradually receded.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao couldn’t wait as he directed his spiritual energy back into his brain and back into his spiritual sea, as he wanted to see what was different about it.</p>
 <p>The changes in his spiritual sea fell into his eyes very swiftly.</p>
 <p>Describing it as world-changing was as suitable as it could get.</p>
 <p>His spiritual sea was drastically different from before. If one could say that his original spiritual sea was a patch of nothingness, his current spiritual sea was now transformed into a patch of real space.</p>
 <p>This space was white, with no end in sight. The first thing he saw the moment he entered it was a large green lake. This lake was filled with vitality and vigor, and its surface was calm and gentle like a mirror. Dense auras of life energy nourished his spiritual sea.</p>
 <p>Such a vast space! Huo Yuhao perceived the boundlessness of his spiritual sea in shock. His spiritual sea was at least three times larger than before, and it was hard to say how much more stable it had become.</p>
