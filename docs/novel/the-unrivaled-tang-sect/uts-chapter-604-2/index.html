 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Long, how are you?” Huo Yuhao hurriedly lifted Long Xiaoyao up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled and replied, “I’m fine. Couldn’t be better. During the process of transferring my soul power to you, I got everything clear in my head. There are no more regrets in my life. Xishui is right. I can finally leave without any regrets. The only person I’ve let down is your teacher. Now, I’m passing all my cultivation to you. I shall consider it my repayment to him. Go and do whatever you want. The Holy Ghost Church should indeed not exist in this world. Don’t have any misgivings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You must quickly cultivate and control the soul power in your body. When you finish adjusting yourself, you can charge towards your third soul core. Remember, don’t be anxious. The only path you can take is space. You can only complete your third soul core if you understand the profundity of space. Both of you need to complement and protect each other in order to succeed. I hope that both of you will become the first cases of humans with three soul cores. In that way, you won’t waste the guidance that Mu En and I have given you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Elder.” Huo Yuhao respectfully acknowledged his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was both sympathetic of and inspired by Long Xiaoyao. However, he didn’t fully agree with his methods. No matter what, he had aided the Holy Ghost Church’s development for his own selfish reasons – his relationship with Ye Xishui. However, Long Xiaoyao was already on the brink of death. There was no need to continue blaming him for anything. Furthermore, he had helped him a lot too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Long, do you have any last wishes?” Huo Yuhao asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head. “No, I’m about to leave this world. I’m finally free. If there’s a next life, it’ll be great if Xishui and I were just ordinary people! Xishui.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his call, Ye Xishui gradually flew over. She landed above him, and her gentle projection seemed to fuse with his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gust of wind blew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s body flew up just like that, and seemed to turn into countless butterflies. Slowly, it turned into powder and dissipated. Only countless spots of light charged into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were black and golden spots, that entangled with one another as they rose into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong watched as these spots of light rose into the sky. Both of them bowed down. No matter what they had done in the past, they were already transcendent in this world! They deserved this respect. Moreover, they had also passed all the power they had left to Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the future, whatever good deeds that he and Tang Wutong performed could be considered as helping to atone for their sins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two Ultimate Douluo! Gone, just like that. It’s unimaginable. I’m afraid Elder Xuan is the only Ultimate Douluo on the continent now.” Tang Wutong said heavily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Don’t be anxious. In the near future, we’ll become Ultimate Douluo too. Even though the process won’t be simple, I’m confident with you by my side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Tang Wutong gave him a sweet smile. Her body’s condition was exactly the same as his right now. She was even faring a little better than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui didn’t lie. All her abilities that were related to evil soul masters had disappeared during that massive explosion. The soul power of the Radiant Phoenix was also light-type. It was fully compatible with Tang Wutong, which made the entire fusion process abnormally smooth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outline of Tang Wutong’s third soul core had already formed. To allow it to accept the space element, Ye Xishui only left a part of the light element inside her third soul core. This was to aid Tang Wutong in her control over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m afraid we can’t unleash our Haodong Power in the future.” Tang Wutong twisted her lips and appeared a little displeased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “That’s because we’re already close to the peak of this world! However, we should still be able to use our fusion skills. If you don’t believe me, we can find someone to test them on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was confused as she looked at him. She asked, “Find who? Xu Tianran?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “Now that Radiant City is on alert, it’s not the time to touch Xu Tianran. You’ve also seen it. He’s too powerful. It’s not good for us to be there right now. When we were still in Radiant City, Elder Long gave me a simplified map. I finally understand where the Holy Ghost Church’s headquarters is. Before he died, the last words he told me were that we can deal with the Holy Ghost Church however we want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Headquarters? Where is it?” Tang Wutong asked, astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao were both dead, Zhong Liwu was the strongest in the church. Huo Yuhao had already defeated him before he became a Transcendent Douluo. Right now, it would naturally be even easier for him. Destroying the Holy Ghost Church was indeed of paramount importance now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was a little excited as she said, “What are we waiting for then? Let’s go.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rank 98! She and Huo Yuhao were both Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo now. Who was a better enemy for them to test their skills than the Holy Ghost Church?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them leaped up at the same time. They were still holding each other’s hands, even though their Haodong Power no longer flowed between them. They rose straight into the sky before picking up speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t need any soul tools now. Their soul power quickly circulated in their bodies. They were controlling the air. Two sonic blasts rang out in the sky before they both disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 22pt"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Moon Empire. Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Any discoveries?” Xu Tianran asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi nodded and replied, “We’ve activated everyone. We didn’t find any clues though. The Holy Ghost Church’s headquarters is too mysteriously located. I only know the rough location. According to Ye Xishui, the Holy Ghost Church should be moving, but I’m not sure what their current situation is. I’ve already sent the army to search in that direction. I hope we can find them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Xu Tianran nodded. He still looked very grim. Up until now, he still couldn’t verify that Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao were both dead. Their deaths were simply too crucial. If they were alive and took revenge anytime soon, the Sun Moon Empire would be in big trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t expect Ultimate Douluo to be so powerful. There’s even a possibility that they aren’t dead. It seems like I’ve really underestimated soul masters. No wonder Shrek Academy could be successful for so many years. This is the foundation of soul masters! It’s a pity we don’t have such talents or opportunities. If I wasn’t hurt then, perhaps I might have stood a chance. But now, I don’t. This time, if both of them are dead, I’m afraid Elder Xuan from the Sea God’s Pavilion is the only remaining Ultimate Douluo. I wonder when the Sun Moon Empire will have its own Ultimate Douluo. When that happens, we’ll be really strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi smiled. She walked over and gently massaged his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It won’t be long before that happens. When Your Majesty rules the entire continent, will you still be scared that you can’t nurture an Ultimate Douluo, given the resources of the entire Douluo Continent?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran relaxed a little. He gently patted Ju Zi’s hand and said, “Well said. You can go prepare now. I’ll give you half a year’s time, and the entire army. Deploy all resources. When we attack again, I want the remaining two empires to be completely wiped out. Your greatest enemy is also in the Star Luo Empire. When are you planning to deal with them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s eyes turned cold, and she replied, “I’ll leave them for last. I want him to watch as his empire is trampled by the Sun Moon Empire’s army. I want him to live in excruciating pain before he finally dies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, good. Well said. Let him suffer in pain before dying!” Xu Tianran laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 22pt"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flying at high speed and controlling the air to propel oneself were two different concepts. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had this same thought right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At Rank 98, they didn’t need to drain their own soul power to fly anymore. They were completely relying on the air to move their bodies according to their wishes. As long as their bodies could take it, their speed was limitless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even they didn’t know how fast they could go. However, they felt as if they were moving thousands of kilometers in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scenery below them changed very quickly. When they passed through clouds, they would automatically dissipate. It was as if the clouds were giving way to them.</span></p>

We will be at our destination very soon. Wutong, our abilities are probably at the tier of an Ultimate Douluo.”</span></p>

We already have Yin-Yang Complement soul cores. Along the way, I’ve been trying to understand our control of the air. We were already Rank 95 Transcendent Douluo earlier, but the feeling is different now. This means that it’s not just our soul power that increased. We were enhanced! What can enhance us to such a tier? Only if we are Ultimate Douluo. This also means that we are as strong as Ultimate Douluo, even though we’ve not yet reached Rank 99. We’re even Ultimate Douluo with Yin-Yang Complement soul cores.”</span></p>
