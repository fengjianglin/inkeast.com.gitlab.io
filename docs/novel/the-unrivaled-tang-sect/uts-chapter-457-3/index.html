 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So it’s about this matter.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao finally understood, and said gratefully, “Thanks, Qiuqiu. I’ll return and ask eldest senior for permission first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll go and find my mother, too. I’ll ask if she’s free within this period of time. Hah, our sect’s territory has already been occupied by the Sun Moon Empire. If we return, we must be careful, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “No worries, it won’t be some kind of death trap. We’ve already overcome the Death God. Do we need to be afraid of ordinary soldiers from the Sun Moon Empire?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu laughed and said, “Eldest senior just lectured you, but you’ve already gone back to your old ways. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll report you to him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, “I’m not afraid. You aren’t that kind of person. You’re the most loyal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu snorted and said, “It seems like we can only be good brothers in this life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled, “It’s great to be good brothers! See, I’m so good to my brothers. Alright, I’ll find Teacher Xuan first. We’ll talk when we get back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next few days, Huo Yuhao was always busy. His discussion with Xuan Ziwen took six hours before he invested his energy into developing stationary soul cannon shells, as Xuan Ziwen handed the job to him. If it were Xuan Ziwen, he would find it very easy to complete this task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Earthdragon Sect, Bei Bei allowed him to proceed there after he was done with this task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the breaks in his experiments, Huo Yuhao wanted to make a trip to the Sea God’s Island and ask Elder Xuan about a problem he had faced during his cultivation. It was just that he found it difficult to turn his attention away from his experiments after he started on them. He only found the time after he completed all his experiments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Class 4 stationary soul cannon shells were completed, they were only two-thirds as strong as normal Class 4 stationary soul cannon shells, but their effective range was almost the same, all a result of the materials used. Xuan Ziwen was already very pleased that they could make it that far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had used a few techniques in their construction. Among them, the most important technique was the delayed activation component of the stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When such cannon shells were fired, they normally relied on the thrust at their tail to travel a distance before exploding. The components that gave them their thrust and power had to be separated using a strong rare metal. The stronger a cannon shell was, the more precious the rare metal needed to separate the components.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao went against conventional logic this time in his design. He used a new activation technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, as these soul cannon shells were specially designed for Zhuge Divine Crossbows, Huo Yuhao fully tapped into their thrusting force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cannons were able to fire the cannon shells around two kilometers in distance. If the shells were detonated within these two kilometers, a lot of energy is undoubtedly wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t separate the components but placed them together in the same compartment. At the bottom of the cannon shells, he used some mechanical principles and created a delayed activation component.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When these shells were fired by the cannons, they would automatically be activated. However, as it didn’t have the thrust component, the power component should directly blow apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, with the delayed activation component, the power component was meant to blow apart after some time. It would take a few seconds. Within these few seconds, the shell would fly more than two kilometers. When the power component was about to detonate, the central detonation component would take effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power component was divided into two parts. One of these parts was the second thrust component. This second thrust component would increase the speed of the shell once again, reaching the speed of an original Class 4 shell and speeding further away. Due to the initial propulsion, it just needed to increase the speed of the shell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, a lot of energy was conserved. Although the strength of the power component was slightly reduced as it was smaller, it was important to remember that the outer shell and mechanical components were made completely from fine iron! It was already very difficult to achieve this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a cannon shell would be two-thirds as strong as usual, but its cost would only be a tenth of normal. This was not even including the fact that some rare metals couldn’t be found on the market. It was indeed possible to mass-produce such cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao’s research only went this far. Stronger stationary soul tools couldn’t be manufactured in this way. They were too strong, and needed rare metals for their outer shells. However, adopting this method would undoubtedly help to conserve resources!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had finally finished. Huo Yuhao reported his results to Bei Bei and was excited as he sat in the chair in front of Bei Bei, gulping down water. He was completely tired out over the past half month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei couldn’t help but smile when he saw Huo Yuhao’s excited look. After Huo Yuhao and the rest returned, they had helped him with a lot of work. He had been much more relaxed over the past half month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, when are you planning to leave since the experiments are done?” Bei Bei asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was puzzled as he asked, “Leave? Where to?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was speechless and said, “Your memory is failing you! Have you forgotten what you promised Qiuqiu? They are helping us. We can’t delay any further. Go and take a look. If it’s some kind of precious rare metal, bring it back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao recalled his conversation with Nan Qiuqiu that day and was embarrassed as he scratched his head. “Alright, eldest senior. I’ll go over in a day or two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Alright, you can go in two days’ time. You should also rest over these two days. You can’t spend all your time researching in the future. Look at Teacher Xuan. He’s a soul tool maniac right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen had become the busiest person in Shrek City. However, it was weird. He managed to become a Titled Douluo amidst all his activity. Recently, he was researching his special Class 9 soul tool. Once his research was over, he would become a true Class 9 soul engineer. He would even be stronger than most ordinary Class 9 soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “I can’t rest. I had some doubts during my cultivation earlier. I still need to ask Elder Xuan about them. Eldest senior, I’ll leave first if there’s nothing else. I’ll go to the Sea God’s Pavilion straightaway. If you want to find me, ask someone to go over there to call me over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished, he quickly rushed out. Every minute was precious to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His soul power had increased by another rank over the past half month. He was now a rank 74 control-type Soul Sage. This increase was a result of his accumulation, as well as his research into the soul power of the Beast God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he was busy performing experiments, Huo Yuhao didn’t manage to improve in his earlier cultivation. But now that the experiments were over, it was time for him to work towards improvements in that area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, wash up before going.” Bei Bei smiled as he called out to Huo Yuhao from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged his words before he disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei had a smile on his face as shook his head helplessly. He gently leaned back in his chair. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something. He pulled the drawer in front of him open and took out a small jade box.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pinkish lights flashed inside this box. It was given to him by the Delicate Silk Immortal, and was one of the two valuable treasures needed to save Tang Ya. However, the only problem was that the Bluesilver Emperor had yet to surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Ya, where are you? How are you doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s expression turned gentler as he thought of her. However, he was deeply worried. It had already been so long since he had received any news of Tang Ya. Without a doubt, she must have been completely influenced by those evil soul masters and lost her awareness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei really wanted to risk everything to find her. He had already secretly decided in his heart that he was going to leave the Tang Sect to find her after the three soul engineer legions were fully equipped. No matter what price he had to pay, he had to bring her back safely, even if he couldn’t find the Bluesilver Emperor…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly went to Shrek Academy after leaving the Tang Sect. The Academy was considered to be in the inner city now. Although Shrek City had expanded, Shrek Academy hadn’t. They only added an extra experimental ground outside of the Soul Tool Department.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that war had begun on the continent, even Shrek Academy wasn’t completely safe. Apart from the students who were already in the Academy, the number of new students was decreasing. If Shrek Academy was already like that, there was no point talking about other Academies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao went straight to Sea God’s Island after entering the Academy. When he was outside the Sea God’s Pavilion, he first kowtowed to the Golden Tree before going in to find Elder Xuan.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan looked much better than he had the last time they had met. He directly brought Huo Yuhao to his room to talk to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan.” Huo Yuhao was delighted as he rushed in front of Elder Xuan. “My experiments have succeeded! We can start manufacturing low-tier Class 4 stationary soul cannon shells now. If we make them in batches, we should be able to surprise the Sun Moon Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was in awe as he said, “Oh? You’ve actually succeeded? You’re indeed a genius!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s only been a few days, but Yuhao has already completed such crucial research. It’s even something the Sun Moon Empire can’t replicate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao started researching, Bei Bei had reported his idea to Elder Xuan during their regular meetings at the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek Academy was no longer peaceful after the war started. The Conference of the Sea God’s Pavilion was meant to be annual, but it was now changed to regular monthly meetings. If there were other special situations, more such meetings had to be organized.</span></p>
