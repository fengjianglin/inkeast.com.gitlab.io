This tiger’s tooth could be said to be the White Tiger Duke’s keepsake!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He actually gave it to me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s my father – is this his gift for me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes couldn’t help but well with tears as he hurriedly turned his head around and said, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke smiled and said, “I should be the one who’s thanking you. Everyone in the Star Luo Empire will remember what you’ve done for the empire, and I will personally celebrate your success when you return. The princess has already promised – as long as you complete this task successfully, you’ll be given the inheritable title of Marquis.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The title of Marquis was second only to the title of Duke amongst the list of titles of the nobility. The Star Luo Empire hadn’t appointed a hereditary Marquis for several hundred years, and one had to understand that a Marquis’ territory would contain a large city at least, let alone the fact that the title could be passed down to future generations. That was truly a blessing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded silently, and a faint smile appeared on his face. The wetness in his eyes abruptly disappeared as he gazed into the distance, and many wonderful emotions resonated in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong’er, was that really you beside me that day? For you, I will try my best to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air became increasingly cold around them. They had already rise to further heights, and everything around them became increasingly quiet amidst the darkness of the night. Intense chills appeared continuously and assaulted their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The method that Huo Yuhao decided on was identical to the first time he went to scout the Ming Dou Mountain Range’s main peak – he would glide through the air. This was the only way he could close the distance most quickly, while it was difficult for him to be discovered. At the same time, this method minimized his soul power expenditure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke escorted him personally this time as well. The ground was gradually swallowed by the darkness, and the thick clouds in the sky were all that could be seen. The chills in the air didn’t affect him, and Huo Yuhao’s heart was very calm in this moment – terrifyingly calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t hang the tiger tooth around his neck. Instead, he held it in his hands and sensed the vicious energies coming from it. However, he felt some warmth in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four thousand meters, five thousand meters, five thousand five hundred meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They reached a height just like they did last time, and the low temperatures consumed more and more of the White Tiger Duke’s soul power. The White Tiger Duke had transformed into a White Tiger, but he had reverted to human form in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s up to you now, Yuhao.” The White Tiger Duke hurtled Huo Yuhao outward with his thick, muscular arms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t say anything, but he gave the White Tiger Duke a thumbs-up with his right hand. He wore his Solo Battle Armor from the get-go today, and three pairs of wings stretched out behind his back, and soul power spurted fiercely as he propelled himself into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he hovered in midair and watched as Huo Yuhao disappeared beyond the horizon. For some reason, he felt as if he had lost something when Huo Yuhao departed this time around; that feeling was unique and anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao tore through the darkness and pressed on. He accelerated through the sky, and once his speed reached a certain level, his arms stretched out from both sides of his body as two layers of thin leather film connected his arm to his thigh. Wind billowed against those films and created air resistance as he began to glide forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had developed these himself through his experience after he returned that day. The wings of his flying-type soul tool had a relatively weaker effect in controlling the airflow, and he descended too quickly while consuming a lot of soul power earlier on, which was detrimental to his subsequent operations. There were many tasks that he had to complete today, and they were the key components of his expedition this time around. Therefore, he had to conserve his soul power no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already activated Spiritual Detection. Everything around him flew by in the blink of an eye, and he continued descending as he bore down on the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was calm, and seemed as if he had completely integrated into the night sky. The side wings made from leather made him look like a giant bat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t have to worry about being discovered by surveillance soul tools at a height of three thousand meters. However, he knew after his previous two reconnaissance missions that the Sun Moon Empire would definitely put more effort into their surveillance coverage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ming Dou Mountain Range came into view in the distance. Huo Yuhao quickly realized a problem as soon as he activated Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were all sorts of surveillance soul tools clustered and arranged compactly about three kilometers from the Ming Dou Mountain Range. The main peak had the most surveillance soul tools around it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some odd-shaped surveillance soul tools besides the original ones. These soul tools looked very strange, as if they had been stacked together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If another soul master who was unfamiliar with soul tools were in Huo Yuhao’s position, he or she probably wouldn’t be able to tell what those things were even if they came close to them. However, Huo Yuhao quickly discerned their identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These things spell trouble! Those relatively large bases below them – aren’t they high altitude aerial surveillance soul tools?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another kind of soul tool on top of each high altitude aerial surveillance soul tool. They were stacked together, which gave them an irregular shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Oscillation detectors?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, they are oscillation detectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s evident that my enemy has realized that normal surveillance soul tools don’t work against me. However, oscillation detectors have relatively smaller areas of effect, though they are comparatively heavier at the same time. They were installed on the mountaintops before this. However, they have actually used high altitude aerial surveillance soul tools as bases, and placed the oscillation detectors on top so that they can hover back and forth through the air in order to find me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The benefit of doing this was that those high altitude aerial surveillance soul tools could carry their respective oscillation detectors back and forth through the air between one thousand and three thousand meters above the ground. This maximized the oscillation detectors’ area of effect, and they could lock down the sky entirely as long as there were enough of these things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if this plan would therefore be foolproof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao continued coming closer because he was gliding through the air. He understood that he couldn’t deal with those oscillation detectors at the moment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if the Sun Moon empire is trying to stop me with such a plan – then they are too naïve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The oscillation detectors’ range was their largest problem. Even though the Sun Moon Empire had deployed enough soul tools, there were still some cracks in their system.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple hues sparkled at the bottom of Huo Yuhao’s eyes as he squinted, and his Eye of Destiny opened on his forehead as every single detail was pictured clearly in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shut his eyes, and only his Eye of Destiny continued observing far into the distance as his gentle spiritual power blanketed the area soundlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wave after wave appeared in Huo Yuhao’s mind. Those waves were presented three-dimensionally, produced by the oscillation detectors in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The oscillation detectors’ main concept was that the gentle soul power undulations released would produce feedback once they came into contact with physical matter. Those detectors would carry their own special waves so that they wouldn’t be confused when they came into contact with each other. These special waves changed every day to prevent enemies from figuring them out.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao leveraged his Eye of Destiny to amplify his Spiritual Detection, and accurately captured the rhythm of these waves before he relied on careful observation to search for their surveillance patterns.</span></p>

He withdrew the six wings behind his back in the next moment, and his body plummeted for a moment as he evaded yet another wave.</span></p>

Otherwise, they would realize that Huo Yuhao’s waltz was spectacular and extraordinary – he managed to evade an oscillation detector’s wave with each changing movement, and he found gap after gap in those seemingly all-covering waves and charged through them.</span></p>

However, pushing forward with Huo Yuhao’s dexterity and agility was beyond difficult.</span></p>

However, even he began to pant a little after he stabilized his body.</span></p>

If he had been even one bit slower, the wave would have swept through him, and he would have become target practice.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao limited his Spiritual Detection to a controlled range and didn’t attempt a sweep in the main peak’s direction.</span></p>

All fire would concentrate on him as well if he was discovered because of that.</span></p>

He slowed his breathing, and it took a long while for him to draw even one breath. He released some of his Ultimate Ice so that he could control his body temperature to be identical to the air around him, and it felt as if he had transformed into a dust particle in the air as he floated forward sneakily.</span></p>
