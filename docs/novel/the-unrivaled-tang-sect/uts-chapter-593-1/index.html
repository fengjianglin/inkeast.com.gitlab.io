 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen looked at Xiao Hongchen and said, “Kid, you were born at the wrong time! If you had avoided this period of time, you’d be a leading figure in any other era. It’s a pity that Shrek Academy has too many talents in this era. They’ve suppressed you, such that you can’t fulfil your potential. You’ve even wasted a lot of potential trying to increase your cultivation, leaving side effects. Otherwise, you would have become a Titled Douluo given the amount of resources we’ve poured into you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xiao Hongchen competed in of the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament for the second time, he had used some kind of special method to increase his cultivation. He had stimulated his own potential to quickly become a Soul Sage. He was preparing to shine in the tournament, but who knew that he would still lose tragically? He even almost lost his life. After that, he only recovered his vital energy after recuperating for five years. Although he had been cultivating tirelessly over the years, his cultivation still lagged too far behind his sister. He had just become a Soul Douluo, but Meng Hongchen was already at Rank 87. Soon, she would try to make a breakthrough to become a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen walked in front of Jing Hongchen and grabbed his wine flask. He downed two mouthfuls from it. After this, his eyes turned red as he said, “Shrek, it’s all Shrek’s fault. They were the ones who thwarted my destiny. One day, I’ll completely destroy Shrek Academy if I manage to make my way into the Illustrious Virtue Hall and control it. I’ll let Huo Yuhao and the rest watch as Shrek Academy is destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up!” Jing Hongchen snatched the flask back. He was furious as he said, “What nonsense are you spouting? Do you think you can destroy Shrek Academy on your own? Remember, don’t let this idea resurface again. Otherwise, you’ll implicate our entire family with you. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen retorted, “Grandpa, didn’t you teach me to aim far and wide since my youth? Why can’t I destroy Shrek Academy? Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t know your limits.” A low-pitched voice sounded. The three of them were astonished at the same time. They turned in the direction of the voice. In the night, the lighting inside the palace was very dim. At this moment, two figures gradually appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all astonished when they saw the appearance of those two figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen’s reaction was the biggest. He almost leapt forward instantly. When he saw his enemy, he became agitated. How could he possibly keep calm?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand and silently stared at the three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen had both grown up. They were no longer as young as they looked in the past. Meng Hongchen was still as pretty as she was before. However, Xiao Hongchen’s hair had already started to turn slightly grey, even though he was still less than thirty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was about to spew flames from his eyes as he saw Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t leap out eventually. Just before he moved, Jing Hongchen pulled him back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Hongchen looked at Huo Yuhao in a daze. When she finally turned her attention to Tang Wutong, her face also turned pale. In her mind, she would never forget Wang Dong. He was her first crush! However, it had only ended in pain. After all these years, it still tortured her greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Hongchen looked at Tang Wutong in a daze and muttered, “What should I call you now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also looked a little awkward as she nodded at her. She replied, “I’m Tang Wutong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Wutong? Aren’t you Wang Qiu’er or Wang Dong’er?” Meng Hongchen was a little astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen roared, “Grandpa, let go of me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up!” Jing Hongchen stood up suddenly. “Piak!” Xiao Hongchen was slapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Jing Hongchen appeared more domineering than he was before. His terrifying and suppressive aura was unleashed towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled. He didn’t even move. The aura from Jing Hongchen disappeared once it was ten meters from him. Jing Hongchen couldn’t even tell what skill he had used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen’s expression changed, and he said, “Both of you, leave right now. There’s no need to get reinforcements. Quickly, leave this place and return to Radiant City.” He was talking to Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, I’m not going!” Xiao Hongchen still refused to listen after being slapped. He had been suppressing his anger for many years. If not for Huo Yuhao, he wouldn’t be in such a state. Would his cultivation have stalled for so many years? He was supposed to be a generational talent, but he couldn’t even touch the peak of this world anymore. He was full of hate right now! He hated Huo Yuhao the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up! Get lost.” Jing Hongchen turned pale.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This rascal. Is it time to be emotional? Even five evil Transcendent Douluo from the Holy Ghost Church lost to this young man. What does he intend on relying on to fight him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen was once the head of the Illustrious Virtue Hall. He had many avenues to turn to for information. He didn’t believe that the hundred soul engineers in the palace were capable of dealing with Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Perhaps they were already dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was only relying on his own strength to seek an escape route for his two grandchildren right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa, we won’t leave. Even if we die today, we must die with you.” Meng Hongchen walked to Jing Hongchen’s side, and a layer of white fog slowly surfaced from her body. She unleashed her Vermilion Clear Icetoad, and white air currents engulfed her. However, they didn’t move towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. This was because she was aware that her lethal poison was useless against Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen was also much more aware now. He gritted his teeth and stood on the other side of Jing Hongchen. Dark golden light flashed from his body. He unleashed his Three-Legged Golden Toad and was prepared to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw how the three of them were ready to fight, Huo Yuhao laughed. Then, he said, “Hallmaster Hongchen, would you believe me if I said we aren’t here to hurt the three of you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen was stunned. However, he didn’t relax because of this. “What do you guys want then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had appeared here without any warning. Weren’t they here for something? Jing Hongchen had heard that Huo Yuhao had once led soul engineer legions to cause trouble in the Sun Moon Empire, causing huge losses. Would he really show mercy now that he was here? It was important to know that the Sun Moon Empire had even surrounded Shrek City not long ago, but Huo Yuhao was the one who forced them to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed slightly and replied, “I really have no intention to kill anyone. To be honest, it’s been many years, but what happened in the past still flashes before our eyes. Although we were once opponents, we shouldn’t be enemies if our empires aren’t at war with each other. Xiao Hongchen, Meng Hongchen, I should thank both of you. Both of you trained me, so that I managed to develop more quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen’s eyes turned red. “Are you treating me as a stepping stone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “Nope, never. I just have this feeling when I think of the past. We were not comparable to both of you in the past. However, we had strong fighting wills. Eventually, we emerged victorious. It’s just we didn’t expect you to take such an extreme path. If you hadn’t overly stimulated your potential back then, we’d still be opponents now. It’s a pity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am I not fit to be your opponent now?” Xiao Hongchen was furious. He suddenly lifted his right hand, turning it into a dark gold metal barrel. A dark gold shell was instantly fired towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and lifted his right hand. He waved it gently, causing the temperature to suddenly fall. In the next instant, that dark golden shell disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Tang Wutong saw a small slit in the air where the shell crossed it. That slit devoured the shell. As for where it exploded, she didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were moving around the Heavenly Soul Empire over the past few years, they had been cultivating too. They were sensing spatial power. After all, spatial power might be the key to their breakthroughs to Ultimate Douluo in the future. Right now, they had developed some understanding of spatial power. Using it now had started to take effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen’s expression changed. He knew what power his grandson had just unleashed. He didn’t expect it to hurt Huo Yuhao, but he didn’t expect it to be neutralized so easily either.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao is indeed much stronger than I expected. How has he done this even though he’s so young?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Hongchen was furious. “Huo Yuhao, why are you flaunting your powers here? What do you really want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t even look at her. Rather, he turned to Jing Hongchen. “Hallmaster Hongchen, we don’t wish to kill anyone today. That’s why I hope you can ask your grandchildren to curb their behavior. I only have one question to ask. Tell me the answer and we’ll leave. I promise I won’t harm them either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if I don’t answer you?” Jing Hongchen asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao calmly replied, “I wouldn’t mind helping Shrek Academy remove some potential threats. I’ve killed many members of the Sun Moon Empire over the past few years. I can’t even count how many anymore. Two more wouldn’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen’s expression changed. “Are you threatening me?”</span></p>
