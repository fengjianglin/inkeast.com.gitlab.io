 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song lifted her hand, and a beam of light shot out. It suddenly exploded not far in front of her, turning into a green image. It was the symbol of Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long afterward, more than ten figures approached from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned when he saw Princess Wei Na of the Heavenly Soul Empire flying in the front. The soul masters with her were quite strong, too. They were all at least seven-ringed Soul Sages. It seemed like the Academy had notified them that Elder Song and Dean Yan were leading a team over. This was why there was such a distinguished welcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest didn’t know, but Huo Yuhao was clearly aware that Princess Wei Na’s status in the Heavenly Soul Empire was just like Princess Jiujiu’s status in the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, Princess Wei Na and the rest arrived in front of them. They stopped thirty meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, you must be Elder Song. I am Wei Na from the Heavenly Soul Empire.” Princess Wei Na greeted Elder Song. Those who were strong were usually well-respected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song smiled and said, “Princess Wei Na, you don’t have to stand on ceremony.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na quickly turned to Huo Yuhao. After nodding slightly at him, she gestured for Elder Song to follow her. The soul masters with Wei Na also made way for those from Shrek Academy to proceed towards Heavenly Spirit City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na and Elder Song flew side-by-side. As they flew, Wei Na softly described the current situation at the front line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao’s ears weren’t as strong as his eyes, he could still hear Wei Na’s words, as she didn’t intentionally lower her voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Princess Wei Na, how’s the situation at the front line right now?” Elder Song asked her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na replied, “It’s still quite stable. Ever since the Star Luo Empire attacked the Sun Moon Empire, the pressure on us has been greatly alleviated. This has been especially true over the past month. The Sun Moon Empire’s attacks have already ceased. They’re only trying to stabilize their own territories now. At the same time, they are still trying to prevent all our surveillance. The most difficult thing for us now is to survey them. In terms of surveillance soul tools, we are really lagging behind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s still a problem of surveillance!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed in his heart. The Sun Moon Empire’s advantage in this area was simply too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na didn’t look too well. Her face was pale, and her eyes were slightly red. She looked overworked. Her empire’s territory had been invaded. As an important member of the imperial family, she was under great pressure. It was rumored that the imperial family of the Heavenly Soul Empire had suffered heavy damage when the empire was invaded. The Emperor even fought personally, and sustained critical injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly Spirit City was a large-scale city in the center of the Heavenly Soul Empire not very far from Heaven Dou City. After the capital was lost, this city was the last stronghold that the empire had. If they lost Heavenly Spirit City, there was a wide expanse of land behind it that the Sun Moon Empire could occupy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na said to Elder Song, “Elder Song, my father wanted to personally come receive all of you. However, he has yet to recover from his injuries. This was why he sent me over. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song shrugged off the apology and said, “You don’t have to stand on ceremony right now. We have a common enemy. Also, the Academy has been receiving support from the Heavenly Soul Empire all this while. It’s only right that we help you on the battlefield. Your Highness, you should know our plan, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she finished speaking, Elder Song’s gaze sharpened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na nodded gently, and didn’t say anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plan that Elder Song referred to was naturally the three soul engineer legions that Shrek Academy was establishing. Currently, only the core members of the three empires of the Douluo Continent knew about this plan. By asking this question, Elder Song was confirming Wei Na’s status in the Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone proceeded towards Heavenly Spirit City, which had been completely revamped. Huo Yuhao saw the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons that the Tang Sect had manufactured on top of the city walls. There were quite a number of them. It seemed like all the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons that the empire had bought from the Tang Sect, as long as they were in perfect condition, were out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were very few civilians in the city. Soldiers were everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na said, “The civilians of the city have been evacuated to a safer place. Right now, this has become a military establishment. It’s also our last line of defense.” As she finished speaking, she couldn’t help but sigh. She revealed a slightly sad look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few months ago, who would have expected the great Heavenly Soul Empire to be reduced to such a tragic state?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the city, Princess Wei Na personally arranged the accommodations for those from Shrek</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Academy</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, temporarily allowing them to stay within Heavenly Spirit City. After that, she personally escorted Elder Song and Dean Yan to meet the senior commanders of the coalition army that had formed between the three empires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone from the Tang Sect remained behind to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was already too tired by now. Once they were given their accommodations, he immediately went to his room to meditate. He was in great need of a rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he awoke from his meditation, the sky had already turned dark. It was evening now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a breath as he walked out from his room. He felt much better. His great spiritual power and life energy meant that he had abnormal recovery abilities. Furthermore, he was still absorbing the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence in his blood, and his soul power was thus increasing steadily. He was consolidating his Rank 80 cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King had naturally followed him on this trip. However, he was a Savage Beast. Ordinary soul masters couldn’t recognize him, but there were Body Sect members at the front line. Those who were stronger could naturally recognize the Ice Bear King. If they wanted to deal with him, trouble would ensue. Although it wasn’t a big possibility, Huo Yuhao still asked the Ice Bear King to rest in his spectral demiplane. He had prepared sufficient food there. In fact, it was all the food that he had stolen from the ration warehouse in Heaven Dou City. With that food around, the Ice Bear King wouldn’t need to worry for at least the next half month.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you awake?” a gentle voice asked. Huo Yuhao turned his head to look, and saw Ye Guyi standing not far away from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had all been allocated a room within a small courtyard. They entered the courtyard the moment they stepped out of their rooms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled as he said, “Guyi, your cultivation has been improving well!” This was his first solo interaction with Ye Guyi since he had returned. From the soul power undulations that she released, he could clearly tell that her cultivation should be around Rank 70. She must have had experienced great progress during her closed-door cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi smiled and replied, “I’m still far from you. You’re my target.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled. “You’re a little too ambitious!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi rolled her eyes and replied, “You’re too arrogant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled, “I’m only speaking the truth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you guys talking about?” Nan Qiuqiu suddenly appeared out of nowhere. She took a few steps to reach Ye Guyi and said warily to Huo Yuhao, “I’ve experienced great improvement, too. Why haven’t you praised me before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao helplessly said, “You’ve experienced great improvement? Why can’t I tell? I only think that you’ve been idling all the time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” Nan Qiuqiu was furious, and was about to act up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a knock was heard from the door to the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu glared at Huo Yuhao before going to open the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a stunned look when he saw who was outside. Wasn’t that Princess Wei Na?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Highness?” Nan Qiuqiu was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na smiled and asked, “Can I come in?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please do.” Nan Qiuqiu immediately made way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After meeting with the senior commanders in the afternoon, Elder Song and Yan Shaozhe had expressed that their sole intention for coming here was just to save people. Of course, they would do their best to help the empire. It was just that the possibility of a fight breaking out now was very slim, given that the situation was very stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know what was going on, but Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu were clearly aware.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is Her Highness here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After entering the courtyard, Wei Na naturally turned to Huo Yuhao. She revealed a surprised look on her face when she saw him and said, “Yuhao, you’re here. I came here to look for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao pointed at his nose and asked, “Me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na nodded and replied, “Yes! Can we talk in your room? I have something to tell you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hesitated for a moment before replying, “Alright then. Your Highness, please.” As he spoke, he led Princess Wei Na into his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu’s eyes widened when she saw Wei Na closing the door. She turned to Ye Guyi and said, “Sister Guyi, see! This guy is attracting the attention of ladies everywhere he goes. I really don’t know what’s so attractive about him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi laughed and answered, “What attracting the attention of ladies? You’re thinking too much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu wasn’t pleased as she said, “How am I thinking too much? If he’s not attracting attention, why did Her Highness come to find him? Isn’t she one of the senior commanders in the Heavenly Soul Empire? I heard she holds an important position, too. If it’s for official matters, she should find eldest senior, even if she doesn’t find Elder Song or Dean Yan. Why did she come to find him? There must be something going on between the two of them.”</span></p>
