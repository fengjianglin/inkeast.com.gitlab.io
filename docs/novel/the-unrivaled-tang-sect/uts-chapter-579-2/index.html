 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Huo Yuhao blamed himself a lot for landing Ma Xiaotao in this state. He believed that she only ended up like this because he didn’t leave with her immediately before. This was why he was willing to risk anything to save her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A layer of diamond ice crystals surfaced on the Icy War God’s Armor. It was the Ice Empress’ Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Huo Yuhao clasped his hands together in front of his chest. He unleashed his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eighth soul ring shone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He unleashed his Ice Bear Blizzard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice and Ice Bear Blizzard were unleashed at the same time, with Huo Yuhao at the center of both attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was like the eye of a blizzard. A whirlpool of ice and snow that resembled a tornado swept towards Ma Xiaotao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By doing this, he was even stronger than when he unleashed his True Body. It was also much easier for him to maintain control. He wouldn’t end the fight immediately, but approach the situation slowly. It was only by doing this that he could control his own attacking strength based on the changes to Ma Xiaotao’s soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only shortcoming of doing this was that his soul power would be drained much more than if he used his True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally, soul masters would enter a weakened state after using their True Body. Huo Yuhao didn’t have such a concern. However, domain-type abilities could only be maintained by draining a lot of soul power, no matter what stage of cultivation a soul master was at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Ma Xiaotao’s Phoenix True Body was entangled in the Ice Bear Blizzard, it was as she had been chained up. The terrifying blizzard was challenging her Ultimate Fire, and a great amount of fog rose into the air. No one could see what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu’s expression was very gloomy. However, there seemed to be a shifty look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Huo Yuhao didn’t know was that Zhong Liwu was only prepared for five out of the ten fights. Among the five fights, Ma Xiaotao was actually involved in one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was more effective against Ultimate Ice than Ultimate Fire? It was just that Ma Xiaotao was supposed to be fourth on Zhong Liwu’s list. She was shifted forward by one now, but it didn’t affect his plan too much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course Zhong Liwu was aware of Ma Xiaotao’s background. She had been a top-performing student in Shrek Academy, and the immediate disciple of Yan Shaozhe. Huo Yuhao was also from Shrek Academy. It was only natural that she shared a close relationship with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he wasn’t worried about her safety when she was sent out to fight. Once Ma Xiaotao drained Huo Yuhao up to a certain point, it would be time for him to doom Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Zhong Liwu’s mind, he wasn’t the most concerned about the Ice Bear King, but Huo Yuhao himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimate Ice martial soul! If he could get a Holy Son with an Ultimate Ice martial soul and who was a Titled Douluo, the Holy Ghost Church’s strength would only stand to increase even if he lost the Bluesilver Holy Lady. In the future, he could have two Ultimate Douluo by his side. They were even Ultimate Douluo with Ultimate martial souls. Who else in this world could fight him then? Even those soul engineers would be helpless against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Ultimate Fire and Ultimate Ice Douluo was an extremely strong combination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could get this Holy Son, he wouldn’t mind sacrificing more. This was because his appearance would only serve to offer the Holy Ghost Church unlimited potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu’s goal wasn’t just to become an Imperial Advisor of an empire. He wanted to become a ruler, the ruler of the entire continent. Whether it was the Douluo Continent or Sun Moon Continent, his goal was to rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fire Phoenix was struggling in the sky. However, the Ice Bear Blizzard and Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice were only getting stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heat in the air had already disappeared. What replaced it was a refreshing chill. The air temperature changed drastically from high to low. This dramatic change left everyone in awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Phoenix flames were released continuously. However, their temperature was quickly brought down when a snowflake landed on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the Fire Phoenix stopped in the air. She opened her wings to their limit, and her body started revolving in the air. A dazzling halo was formed by her wings, and sonorous phoenix calls continued to echo. Dark red streaks of light started to expand, isolating the blizzard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fire Phoenix also picked up speed. In just an instant, she came in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only had time to lift his hand. He lifted his right hand in an attempt to stop the Fire Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Ma Xiaotao’s eighth soul skill, Nine Heavens Phoenix Dance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Scorching phoenix flames were already in front of Huo Yuhao. Two balls of blinding light shone behind Huo Yuhao’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sun and a moon appeared. The sun was gold, while the moon was blue. The sun and the moon intersected weirdly, causing Huo Yuhao to enter a special state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The phoenix flames struck his body, but they started to revolve tremendously. After this, they were flung away. The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice also experienced weird changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snowflakes started to conjoin in the air, forming lines of snow. After this, they tangled up and formed chains that started to entangle the Fire Phoenix from all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the improved version of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, Ice Snow Chain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every chain was a consolidation and fusion of Ultimate Ice. When they landed on the Fire Phoenix, they caused her to shake tremendously. The temperature of the phoenix flames fell drastically. No matter how much Ma Xiaotao tried to muster her soul power, her flames couldn’t get past Huo Yuhao’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an unprecedently strong force in his palm. All the energy that rushed to his palm would instantly be flung away. They couldn’t breach it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The shining sun and moon behind Huo Yuhao’s back became stronger and stronger. Even the Sun in the sky seemed to lose some of its glow in the face of Huo Yuhao’s sun and moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of power is this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was astonished, but none of them knew anything about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Zhong Liwu was astounded. However, he knew more than the rest. This was because he could still recall that he had seen a similar sun-moon projection behind Di Tian before. It was just that Di Tian’s was much stronger. However, their auras were very similar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of strength has he understood to make him so strong now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Zhong Liwu was astounded, the look of delight in his eyes intensified. The stronger Huo Yuhao was, the stronger the future Holy Son of the Holy Ghost Church would be if his plan succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, what a brilliant Holy Son!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the chains entangled her further and further, the Fire Phoenix struggled less and less.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao’s soul power fell significantly as she was restrained by the chains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a faint sigh of relief. He had used the power of his twin soul cores, which enabled him to trap Ma Xiaotao without hurting her. It was important to know that this wasn’t easy. It was actually very difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had succeeded. Even though he was drained, it was worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, the Fire Phoenix suddenly lifted her head. There was a manic streak of light that seemed to come from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What? This isn’t good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was shocked. Just as he was about to react, it seemed like it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A terrifying ball of golden-red light was suddenly unleashed from Ma Xiaotao’s True Body. The chains were instantly crushed. Heat dominated again, and the frightening explosive flames instantly devoured Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this was Ma Xiaotao’s ninth soul skill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Phoenix Nirvana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A phoenix and the fire of baptism led to nirvana and rebirth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a state of nirvana, a phoenix was at its strongest and its weakest state. At the beginning of nirvana, a phoenix was at its strongest. At the end of nirvana, it was at its weakest. However, they both brought new life to the phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Phoenix Nirvana was Ma Xiaotao’s strongest and ninth soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the enemy didn’t die, she would most certainly die after unleashing her Phoenix Nirvana, since she would be in a weakened state for a month. However, this attack was at the standard of an Ultimate Douluo. If she could become a Transcendent Douluo in the future, even an Ultimate Douluo would need to fear such an attack from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was one of Zhong Liwu’s trump cards. He wasn’t afraid that Huo Yuhao would kill Ma Xiaotao. He was even less worried that Ma Xiaotao wouldn’t be able to unleash her Phoenix Nirvana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t even need to accumulate for this soul skill. She could just unleash it with a thought. The price to pay was to become weak for a month. This was a testament to how much power she could unleash with this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know that. This was why he was engulfed by her Phoenix Nirvana. The entire sky turned golden-red. It was as if countless golden-red flowing clouds were shaking the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within a fifty kilometer radius from Shrek City to the Sun Moon Empire’s base, a heatwave seemed to sweep over everything. The heat caused everyone to feel extremely fearful and frustrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stood where she was and watched everything in a daze. She didn’t move. There was only a very unsettled look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu smiled. He was delighted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was Huo Yuhao dead? Of course he wouldn’t die. Zhong Liwu was very confident in Huo Yuhao. He was a Transcendent Douluo who possessed Ultimate Ice. He even had many powerful soul tools on his body as well as that divine blade. How could he possibly die so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he would surely be skinned even if he didn’t die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scorching golden-red flames lasted for a good minute before they slowly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first figure that appeared was drifting in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strange golden-red runes spun around her body. She was calmly lying in the air. Her hair was flowing, and her eyes were shut. It was as if everything in the outside world had nothing to do with her.</span></p>
