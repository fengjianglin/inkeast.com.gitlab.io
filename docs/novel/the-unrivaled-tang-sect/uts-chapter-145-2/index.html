As Shrek Academy’s second-in-charge, he was extremely frightening when he unleashed his powers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Twin Cyclops was instantly crushed into the ground. Even though it tried to retreat, it was still struck by the shockwave and was critically injured. It was not even a real hundred thousand year soul beast. Even if it was, how could a normal hundred thousand year soul beast fight Elder Xuan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A screeching howl rang out in the next instant. A dark red figure blocked Elder Xuan from unleashing his next attack on the Three-Eyed Golden Lion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan descended amidst a reverberating boom. Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao were also beside him, which meant that he still needed to worry about their safety. The figure that blocked Elder Xuan was knocked back a hundred meters by the Godly Taotie Bull’s strength, but it still remained in front of the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. Three furious howls were released at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mysterious figure was a 5 meter long soul beast, it was extremely burly. It seemed like a lion, but it had three identical heads that were over a meter in diameter. Its terrifying teeth released a scarlet-gold glow. The three heads roared furiously at the same time and all the soul beasts within a ten square mile radius didn’t dare to move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The cacophony of noises also affected Mo Feiyun’s group in the distance. Huo Yuhao’s sudden disappearance left them extremely displeased. However, a streak of yellow light suddenly flashed by. They didn’t even see it clearly before Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao disappeared. At this point, Huo Yuhao’s Ice Empress’ aura, and the series of furious roars and explosions caused this bunch of soul masters to turn pale. They wondered whether they were somehow in the Core Region rather than the Hybrid Region. Mo Feiyun led everyone as they escaped. They couldn’t be bothered to hunt soul beasts anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Scarlet King?” Elder Xuan’s expression turned serious as he looked at the soul beast that roared furiously. He stopped his attack too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re that fellow from Shrek Academy.” The three-headed soul beast that had a lion’s form spoke in the human tongue, but its voice was filled with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan growled, “Scarlet King, I won’t make things difficult for you on account of our academy’s agreement with the Star Dou Savage Beasts. Give way immediately and hand that golden-furred lion over to me.” His fury had already reached its limit. How could he explain things to Elder Mu if Huo Yuhao was truly dead?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao also turned pale as they stood behind Elder Xuan. This was especially so for Wang Dong, who felt as if everything had turned black in front of him. Something seemed to have been crushed in his heart. The intense pain manifested as tears which trickled down his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In just an instant, Yuhao… Yuhao is already…”</span></p>

If you dare to touch it, you’ll become the common enemy of all the soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan stared at the Scarlet King coldly. “I don’t care who it is. I only know that it has killed and possibly even eaten one of Shrek Academy’s most important disciples. You know that you’re not my match even though you’re ranked 8</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;among the Ten Great Savage Beasts. I won’t mind if you want to die with it. I can’t account to the academy anyways. Why not just kill to my heart’s content?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Elder Xuan had already taken a step forward. His frightening aura resembled a mountain crashing towards the Scarlet King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a minute!” The Scarlet King was a little worried. Although it had cultivated for more than three hundred thousand years, and was indeed ranked 8</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap">th</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;among the Ten Great Savage Beasts, he was definitely not Elder Xuan’s match. It was too late for him to signal for help at this point. The top-ranked soul beasts needed some time to rush out from the Region of Savage Beasts, but time was not something that Elder Xuan would offer them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait for?” Elder Xuan asked coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scarlet King said, “Human, don’t attack. I’m protecting the Great Star Dou Forest’s Emperor Beast, which is the only one in the continent now. If it dies, the entire Great Star Dou Forest will go crazy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was shocked. He had heard of Emperor Beasts before, but he thought that they were only a legend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t care if all of you go mad. I’m going mad myself now.” Elder Xuan didn’t back off. Huo Yuhao’s ‘death’ had already caused him to lose his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hear me out first.” The Scarlet King said anxiously, “The Emperor Beast is called the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. It won’t attack humans unless it’s attacked first. It only feeds on the brain matter of light-type soul beasts. Let me ask if it really killed your student.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In such a crisis, and especially one that concerned the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s life, the Scarlet King had to remain respectful towards Elder Xuan although it was a savage beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan calmed down after hearing his words. Was Huo Yuhao really dead?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, a powerful and frightening aura was released not far from where they were. That brutal will came from the aura of another savage beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan and the Scarlet King were both stunned as they sensed this aura. The Scarlet King was perplexed. That aura came from a Transcendent Soul Beast just like it, but why did the ice-cold aura seem so familiar? It seemed to have appeared once just a moment ago, but the aura disappeared before he could look for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was delighted after a momentary daze. Huo Yuhao was imitating the aura of a hundred thousand year soul beast! He wasn’t dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was obviously alive. He was slow to react because he couldn’t interfere when the two powerful figures were at odds with one another. He only imitated the Ice Empress’ aura under the Ice Empress’ advice as he hid where he was being repressed to send the message that he was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan knew what was going on, but the Scarlet King didn’t! However, it believed that it was a good thing for him and the Three-Eyed Golden Lion that a savage beast had rushed over. A soul beast with a cultivation over a hundred thousand years possessed an intelligence that was superior to ordinary humans. It wouldn’t start conflicts easily. Moreover, the Scarlet King knew that this savage beast that came would definitely help it in protecting the Emperor Beast. It wasn’t that afraid of Elder Xuan anymore with another savage beast around. It was confident in protecting the Three-Eyed Golden Lion even if it couldn’t beat Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A low and loud roar came from the Scarlet King’s three heads. An intense dark red radiance also spewed out from its body, and the three heads seemed to balloon in size. A ghastly feeling enveloped Elder Xuan, as the Scarlet King’s roar called for all soul beasts to rush over to protect the Emperor Beast. Since he possessed enough strength to resist the enemy, why would a three-headed Scarlet King who was also one of the Ten Great Savage Beasts and the king of the Canidae-type soul beasts compromise with a human?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was very relieved when he learned that Huo Yuhao was still alive. He immediately developed a plan in his mind and roared furiously too. He revealed his Godly Taotie Bull, and the two of them clashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A situation that left the Scarlet King extremely depressed occurred. The aura of the savage beast that had appeared earlier disappeared, and there was no more movement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wanted to give in to Elder Xuan now, but Elder Xuan wouldn’t entertain that notion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scarlet King could only try to protect itself as he faced Elder Xuan. It was slowly losing ground as it defended itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Elder Xuan and the Scarlet King didn’t go all-out apart from Elder Xuan’s first, formidable blow. If they did so, it would be a catastrophe for the entire Great Star Dou Forest. This was something that neither of them wanted to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense yellow radiance appeared like a sticky fluid, and a cage formed by the powers of the earth rose up, trapping the Scarlet King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scarlet King’s three heads roared, and its dark red fur surged with streaks of black patterns. It was like a volcano that had erupted, trying to break free from the restraints.</span></p>

How can I believe you?”</span></p>
