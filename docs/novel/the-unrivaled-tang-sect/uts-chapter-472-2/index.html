 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul beasts that had relatively lower cultivation like these had never seen the Ice Empress or Snow Empress before, especially when they didn’t have this form. They were in human form now, and no different from humans when they were deliberately hiding their aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Extreme Northern Bear roared as his majesty was disregarded. It charged at Huo Yuhao with his muscular body, and its enormous frame stood up as it swung its paws down at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection had been trained on it the entire time. He could clearly feel that when the bear was using its strength, its thick fur was immediately charged with intense soul power, and every single hair became like needles. Its fur was its best defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no question that this bear was a kind of soul beast where its own body was its main strength. The Extreme Northern Bears shared similar characteristics with the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears, except it didn’t have the Darkgolen Terrorclaw Bear’s fearsome claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao glanced at the Ice Empress and the Snow Empress, and when he realized that they didn’t intend to do anything, he couldn’t just stand there and let the bear smack him! He went forward to face the bear with a body like a demon, and he grabbed the bear’s right paw that was swiping down at him with both arms as he suddenly used his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao’s martial soul didn’t have anything that was based on strength, he had obtained part of the Golden Dragon’s strength after Wang Qiu’er had sacrificed herself for him. In addition to the fact that he had seven soul rings, he definitely wasn’t afraid of the bear in front of him in terms of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao swung the bear’s eight-meter tall enormous body into the air and sent it crashing into the icy surface as an explosive impact rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other two bears that were charging in from the flanksurprised. However, they accelerated as they charged toward Huo Yuhao furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is what a male and two females are like!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao’s body flickered, and he didn’t take them by force anymore. Instead, he ran behind the Ice and Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you two aren’t going to let me eat bear paws, shouldn’t you at least be doing something?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress grunted as she unleashed the aura that she was originally suppressing. An unrivaled aura was immediately released, and a tremendous pressure that belonged to a hundred-thousand-year soul beast bore down on the three ice bears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three bears that had gone berserk acted like they had been doused by a bucket of cold water as their hysterical aggression immediately disappeared. They growled softly as they stumbled back in retreat. The bear that Huo Yuhao had slammed into the ground rolled onto one side, its manner was almost a little comical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tiny bear that was following from behind halted immediately when it felt this aura. It covered its head with its paws and lay prostrate on the ground with its buttocks pointed high up into the air, just like that, and that was about as amusing as it could get.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She’s the Ice Empress, after all!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress’ eyes flashed with green light as a strange sound rang out in her mouth. This sound had a very intriguing and alluring quality, apparently the soul beasts’ language.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three bears nodded continuously when they heard her voice. A superior that was giving them so much pressure meant they didn’t even consider resisting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three bears got to their feet after a moment as they swiftly ran away into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress stared at them as they left and muttered under her breath, “It feels great to be back! Snow, how nice would it be if we were still the dictators of this place? We don’t have any natural enemies here, and nobody is around to oppose us. This is our paradise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress floated up next to her and smiled as she replied, “I beg to differ. I have begun to understand humans ever since I’ve walked into the human world. Over the past months and years, we have always detested humans, and we hate them for disturbing our way of life. However, we are disturbed considerably less by soul beasts here compared to the Great Star Dou Forest. Even though I lost my memory after following Yuhao, I can still see the outside world very clearly as the Snow Lady. We have to admit that humans possess intelligence and creativity superior to ours, and we can only adapt to nature, while they can change everything. This the reason why humans could conquer the entire continent even though they are so weak in the beginning when they are born. They’re just too creative. If I were given a chance to choose again, perhaps I’d choose to be a human.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress’ body quivered. She didn’t think the Snow Empress would say something like that, as this wasn’t the Snow Empress that she knew. The Ice Empress turned towards her, her eyes filled with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and said, “Are you surprised? Have you not seen through everything, Ice? Think about it. How long have we been living in the Extreme North, and how long have we been ruling over this place? Haven’t you had enough? Right now, I just want to use the remaining years of my life to experience other things, as much as I can. This is the only way for me to feel excited, and to feel glorious. I won’t regret it even if Yuhao doesn’t succeed in the end. Perhaps I will choose to compress my origin and fuse with another human when that happens, and I’ll become a human once more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress said, “You’ve changed, Snow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled. “Yes! I’ve changed. Otherwise, how could I allow you to be together with Skydream? Speaking of which, how is he worthy of you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress blushed as she lowered her head. She had been concealing her emotions ever since that day, and she hadn’t really paid any regard to the Skydream Iceworm. The Skydream Iceworm wasn’t worried, and he just stuck with her every day and asked about her well-being. The Ice Empress’ expression of love made him blissfully happy, and what made him even more excited was that the Snow Empress didn’t stop them from being together. Instead, she was adding fuel to the fire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress said after a few moments, “Yes! You’ve changed, and I have too. Perhaps, all this is because humans have affected us.” She turned towards Huo Yuhao as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t ask any of you to change anything!” Huo Yuhao said helplessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress grunted and said, “We can see everything you do. You have been changing us through imperceptible influence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She paused for a moment after that, then continued, “Maybe I should feel fortunate, because you are the one who has shown us the world of humans. Before I met you, I had always believed that humans were tiny and pathetic with all their avarice, cruelty, and cunning. All they knew was to take from Mother Nature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But you have gradually changed my perspective after we met, and I have realized that there are humans like you who are determined with their emotions. Your creativity and your talent, and a great many other things, weren’t bestowed upon you by me or the Skydream Iceworm. We are helping you, but the truth is that you’ve been helping us, too. We have learned a great many things from you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly and said, “Can you not be so touching? However, Brother Skydream should really thank me. Without me as a vessel, he wouldn't have had a chance of moving your heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t talk about him!” the Ice Empress retorted bashfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled as he continued. “Ice Empress, since you’ve already confirmed your feelings, why do you still run away from them? In this world, no matter how powerful you are or how powerful we will become in the future, nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. Just like that day when I was surrounded by enemies on all sides. I never expected to land in a trap, and if I wasn’t lucky that day, in addition to my appropriate response, perhaps I would have died. Your destinies would have changed because of my death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress frowned said, “What are you trying to say? Don’t beat about the bush!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I’m trying to tell you that life is short, and we have to enjoy our happiness while we still can. Since you have already confirmed your feelings, why don’t you treat them accordingly? Brother Skydream truly likes you, and since you like him too, then you should accept his feelings seriously.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress blushed even more as she rolled her eyes and said, “You males just know how to help other males!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled, but said nothing else. He turned towards the Snow Empress and said, “What should we do next?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled plainly and said, “We wait – all we must do is wait here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wait?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao was starting to understand.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like the Ice Empress asked those bears to pass some messages along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at that moment, the Snow Empress’ elegant frame suddenly slid backwards and drifted into the sky like an apparition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful, Snow Empress,” Huo Yuhao hurriedly shouted at her. He had personally experienced how frightening those hurricanes were in the sky, but the Ice Empress revealed a mocking smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress seemed like she didn’t hear Huo Yuhao’s voice as she floated into the air. She was just dancing in the air, and she stepped on nothing as she waltzed into the winds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She gradually released her aura. Her aura wasn’t as intimidating as the Ice Empress, but Huo Yuhao realized to his surprise that everything dimmed when her aura was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white snow disappeared. All the ice and snow became blue, and the figure dancing in the sky was the only thing that was white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her long sleeves waved as white ribbons danced around her. Those blue snowflakes circled around her as they rippled and unfolded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Lady was like the spirit of the snow. Her wonderful posture made her seem like she had become the core of the Extreme North’s core region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were frozen. He had never expected someone to have such a beautiful posture, and that someone could be so alluring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress had unrivaled beauty. In this moment, she seemed almost completely immersed in her dance as the gusts in the air grew gentle. The temperature seemed to rise a little amid the fluttering snowflakes. There was no warmth, but there was no chill either. There was only a pure and refreshing coolness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue hues stretched far into the distance. Everywhere her eyes could reach had been tainted blue, while the sky and the ground could no longer be told apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This feeling is just wonderful.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao believed, in that moment, that this was the most gorgeous scene he had ever seen in his life. His heart was intoxicated at this moment, while the ice-type soul power in his body rippled along with the Snow Empress’ dance.</span></p>
