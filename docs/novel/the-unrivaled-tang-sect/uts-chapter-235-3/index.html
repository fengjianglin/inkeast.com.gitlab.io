Zhong Litian was raging as he said, “Bastard! They’ve killed that Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear sow, too! Liren, go after those two little rascals. Lidi, go check out that bear and see if her beast soul is still intact. I’ll go back for the male bear’s beast soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Zhong Liren transformed into a cloud as he raced in pursuit of Wang Qiu’er and Huo Yuhao. He activated his senses to the highest possible level as his Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor followed closely behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had borrowed the cannon’s recoil to propel himself backward. He had crashed into Wang Qiu’er, and had meant for her to use this force to escape as quickly as they could. However, when their momentum was about to come to an end, he realized something wasn’t right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s body wasn’t as tough as her strength made it seem. Rather, it was exceptionally soft and tender. Huo Yuhao had hugged Wang Dong’er before, and Wang Dong’er’s body was a little bouncier, and the faint fragrance that a girl had would enchant him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt a lot different as he came into contact with Wang Qiu’er at such a close distance. Wang Qiu’er’s body was actually much softer than Wang Dong’er’s body, and her aroma wasn’t the fresh fragrance that young girls normally had. Instead, she smelled like... sunlight? It was equally fragrant, but it a completely different style altogether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They landed onto the ground at the same time, and didn’t even bother saying a word to each other as they turned around to run. They realized that they couldn’t meet up with their companions anymore, and the only thing they could do was run, as the brothers’ reach covered the entire region. They no longer had that Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s aid, and their only outcome was death if this Soul Douluo caught up with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They turned around to run. Wang Qiu’er’s right foot pushed off heavily against the ground, and a crack like an explosion was audible as she pulled Huo Yuhao along, and the two of them surged forward as if they were riding the clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strength is just so fearsome!,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was thought, but he didn’t stop moving. Right when their momentum was slowing down, he activated the soul thrusters on his back as he held onto her and raced forward once more. Their coordination was seamless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them relied on this coordination as they meandered through the forest with lightning speed. Huo Yuhao’s judgment was as accurate as ever, and they avoided all the vegetation as much as they could while they pushed forward frantically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s split up.” Wang Qiu’er suddenly blurted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao snapped around towards her and said solemnly, “No. Those evil soul masters have beast souls, and us splitting up will be equally futile. We can only run faster if we work together, and we will have a higher chance of survival.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er stared at him as she asked, “Why did you come to save me? Can’t you tell that your girlfriend doesn’t like me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gazed straight ahead as they continued coordinating to push forward. He gave a very natural answer, “We’re schoolmates, how can I just let you die?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s mouth twitched, and she said arrogantly, “I wouldn’t have died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said exasperatedly, “Is your pride more important, or is your life more important? Let’s not talk about all that and focus on running away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er turned back around at him and took a deep breath before she said, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heheh,” Huo Yuhao chuckled. He couldn’t relax even for a little bit, and all his focus and concentration was on blitzing forward. He didn’t pay attention to something that Wang Qiu’er mumbled under her breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you say?” Huo Yuhao asked subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er shook her head and said, “Nothing. That bastard seems to have caught up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Zhong Liren had caught up with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take them very long to run several kilometers away, but Zhong Liren still caught up with them in the end. He was just so much stronger than Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er in terms of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch out!” Wang Qiu’er suddenly moved as she pushed Huo Yuhao away heavily with her right hand before she turned around and thrust her Golden Dragon Spear into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ding!” Wang Qiu’er’s body was tossed away with the crisp sound of a collision, and the Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor revealed itself. Not even Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection could capture its ambush!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s it!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huo Yuhao grit his teeth as he planted his foot on a tall tree in front of him, turning around and charging back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren and that Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor were just too quick, to the point where they had no chance of escaping. Under such circumstances, their only chance to survive was to fight with everything they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s body erupted once more with intense chill when he turned back around. A golden vertical eye opened on his forehead at the same time, and his Spiritual Detection received a great boost. He shared his Spiritual Detection with Wang Qiu’er as they were finally able to capture the leopard’s movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao raised his right hand and lashed out with his Darkgolden Terrorclaw. He collided with the leopard in midair with a shrill clanging sound, but the Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor was forced to stop in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was extremely ferocious as her Golden Dragon Spear transformed into a golden lightning bolt and arrived before the leopard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Spiritual Detection, their cooperation was as seamless as if Wang Qiu’er had been working together with Huo Yuhao for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor was formidable, but it was still a little fearful of Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear. Its body suddenly became illusory when the brilliant golden light was about to hit, and all Wang Qiu’er struck was a shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s soul thrusters activated as they propelled him back to Wang Qiu’er’s position. He didn’t use the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. The domain was mighty, but it also limited their movement and freedom. This was especially true since this domain didn’t distinguish between friends and enemies, so Wang Qiu’er would also be affected inside this domain. Huo Yuhao believed that the domain would end up affecting their abilities and autonomy, and it would be over for them as long as Zhong Liren had some patience, or if he had some attack that covered an area</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren was only one beat behind the leopard, and his poisonous gaze seemed like it was piercing right into Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er’s souls. The Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor appeared next to him, and even though it was a beast soul, its brown body continuously emanated an intense pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Run! Why aren’t you guys running anymore? You think you can outrun my Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor with your speed? I originally believed that we had sustained heavy losses, but now my mind has changed. A Darkgolden Terrorclaw soul bone… very good, that soul bone shall be mine! You guys have such power at such a young age, and it seems like your identities and experiences are quite extraordinary. It’s a pity, because today will be the day you die. I will torture the two of you and listen to your agonizing wails for seven days before I’ll let the two of you die, to make up for my losses!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhong Liren had reverted back from his martial soul true body as he spoke. He was only faced with two young soul masters, and he didn’t believe he would need his martial soul true body to fight. Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er were already dead in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes sparkled as he took a deep breath. He knew that this would probably be the most difficult battle of his life, and possibly even his last battle. His fighting will wasn’t weakened at all in the face of such a mighty adversary. Instead, it was slowly rising, and he felt stronger the more powerful his opponent was. This was the profundity of the Sovereign’s Descent! A layer of golden light gradually shimmered on his body, and he subconsciously grasped Wang Qiu’er’s hand as he infused his soul power into her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?” Wang Qiu’er exclaimed softly.</span></p>

The first thing that fused when their soul power touched wasn’t the soul power itself, it was the spiritual power contained within their respective soul powers! Their spiritual power was fused to such an extent that Huo Yuhao felt as if he was Wang Qiu’er, and Wang Qiu’er was him in that instant.</span></p>

He could feel that his strength was climbing exponentially, and even his spiritual power felt the same way. Wang Qiu’er seemed to have fused with him completely.</span></p>
