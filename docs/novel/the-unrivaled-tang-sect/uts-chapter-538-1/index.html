 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-eff81e55-7fff-b4f3-0586-fa4ffcf2b05a"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao’s Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute might only have seven soul rings, but they were all ten-thousand-year soul rings, except for the one yellow hundred-year soul ring, which she had added back during the freshman competition to help Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why she used her Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute instead of her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron was that everyone was familiar with her flute. At the same time, her flute granted her immense controlling power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes were not a pure control-type martial soul, but Xiao Xiao’s Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, when Elder Xuan was mentoring her, he once told her how the simplest method to become a truly powerful soul master was to become the best at a certain field. Regardless of what field it was, as long as one was able to become the best in that area, he or she would possess immense power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apparently, Xiao Xiao had subscribed to that belief, and had persisted with her decision. And reality showed that she had succeeded. By using the powerful controlling ability of her Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute, she was actually able to restrain Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green phoenix in the sky tucked its wings in, and Xiao Xiao reappeared in mid-air. Following which, a huge black cauldron appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this cauldron appeared, the number of soul rings on Xiao Xiao’s body increased from seven to eight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right! Xiao Xiao had already attained the rank of a Soul Douluo! Her primary martial soul already had eight soul rings. She was now a powerful eight-ringed Soul Douluo with the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the fifth soul ring on Xiao Xiao’s body lit up, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron expanded furiously against the wind. The matte black cauldron seemed to embody immense authority as the surrounding air became increasingly dense and heavy. The cauldron seemed to have transformed into a humongous mountain as the people from the Tang Sect felt the immense pressure radiating from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cauldron floated over Ji Juechen as it started to release a humming sound. It released countless humongous runes which started to circle around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Ji Juechen, who was stuck within the formation formed by the phoenix pillars, seemed to have become frozen as he quietly stood where he was. However, his whole body had transformed into a greyish black color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the sound waves from the phoenix pillars continued to attack him, they were unable to penetrate his defense. At this instant, Xiao Xiao felt an inexplicable sense of danger. Even though she seemed to have the upper-hand over Ji Juechen, she did not feel as though she had an advantage over him. Instead, she felt very uncomfortable, as though something ominous was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao released a low growl as she pointed in the direction of the cauldron with her right hand. At that instant, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron released a loud and powerful humming sound as it dropped from the sky toward Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A powerful black light was also ejected from the mouth of the cauldron. Endless authority descended from the heavens as the black pillar of light struck Ji Juechen ahead of the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the fifth soul skill of Xiao Xiao’sThreelives Soulcrush Cauldron—Threelives Soulcrush. It was a powerful sealing soul skill which acted directly on the body and the soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, with the help of the Threelives Soulcrush, Xiao Xiao was actually able to seal a powerful evil soul master and contribute to the team’s success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the person she was facing now was Ji Juechen. The sword fanatic, Ji Juechen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bright cry escaped Ji Juechen’s mouth, following which, a matte black sword light erupted from the ground like black ink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both the Threelives Soulcrush and the sword light from Ji Juechen were black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two black forces collided with a humongous impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen’s figure rose up into the sky like a dragon ascending to the heavens. However, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron had vanished in that instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right, it had somehow vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cauldron which was falling rapidly had disappeared without any warning. However, if one were to pay attention to Xiao Xiao, one would notice the sly smile that had formed on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A humongous cauldron sneakily appeared below Ji Juechen’s feet. The same black pillar enveloped and trapped Ji Juechen after he had exploded up into the sky with his maximum effort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen was caught in that moment when he had just exerted strength on a previous soul skill, and was recovering his energy for the next blow. Hence, his body froze upon contact with the Threelives Soulcrush as he was sealed in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A small thing that resembled a lizard rested itself silently on Xiao Xiao’s shoulder. This thing seemed to be a little strange, as it looked different from a normal lizard. However, because it was hidden within a ball of dark light, no one could see its true appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nonetheless, it was its existence that allowed the Threelives Soulcrush technique to suddenly change positions. This allowed Xiao Xiao to trick Ji Juechen into exposing himself to her attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Threelives Soulcrush was completed, the matte black cauldron suddenly expanded before releasing a powerful suction force. Ji Juechen was sucked into the cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eighth ring on Xiao Xiao’s body lit up, and nine humongous golden runes fell from the sky onto the cauldron. Instantly, the black cauldron was dyed a uniform golden color as it dropped to the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The phoenix pillars disappeared, leaving only the cauldron sparkling on the ground. The ten golden runes on the cauldron glowed intensely in an intermittent fashion, as though they were trying to resist powerful blows from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao floated back to the ground as she looked at the commotion before her with surprise. Even though she might have beaten Ji Juechen, she knew that she had not won by ability. She was only able to defeat him because of her tactics.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen was simply too unfamiliar with her abilities. Conversely, Xiao Xiao had watched so many of his spars with the others. Hence, she possessed a superior understanding of his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen’s final attack—his Sword Fanatic Domain—was undoubtedly his greatest skill. Xiao Xiao’s prior control was simply her way of waiting for that moment to come. When Ji Juechen launched his most powerful attack, it was also the time when he was most vulnerable to any form of attack. If he were to fail to land a blow in a single attempt, his aura and sword intent would drastically decrease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao had been waiting for this opportunity all along. Of course, she understood that Ji Juechen could have directed his final attack at her instead of her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron. Even though he would most definitely get hurt, she would also not be able to escape unscathed. The truth was that even though Ji Juechen was a sword fanatic, he would still not put his own people in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao raised her right hand as the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron transformed into a streak of light before returning to her body. A deafening sword aura flickered as Ji Juechen reappeared within the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked slightly ragged after reappearing. There were many holes in his clothes, and his face seemed to be slightly pale. However, the spark in his eyes showed that he was actually very excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scariest thing about the sword fanatic was how he was not afraid of losing. In fact, the more he lost, the more excited he would become. That was why everyone had a headache when facing him. The more they tried to put him down, the more he wanted to fight them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have lost. That was very impressive!” Ji Juechen nodded as he looked at Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao shook her head and said, “No. I definitely can’t compare to you when it comes to our true abilities. You only lost because you did not understand my skills well enough. Also, you chose to go easy on me instead of putting me in harm’s way. When we fight the next time, I will definitely lose to you. I can sense that you haven’t even released your full fighting power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen shook his head and said, “It’s still a loss at the end of the day. I can sense that you did not go all-out on me either. It would be very difficult to say who would win if we were to fight to the death. But that would only result in serious injuries for both of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen’s words were usually very objective. Hence, his praise had elevated Xiao Xiao to a new status. It meant a lot about Xiao Xiao’s ability when she was able to hold her own against the sword fanatic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou gaped as he stared at Xiao Xiao. “Xiao Xiao, I can’t believe how strong you’ve become. If we were to battle within a fixed physical range, I might not even be able to beat you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao waved her little fist at He Caitou and said, “So you better watch out! If you dare bully me in the future, I’ll make sure I put you down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou gave her an awkward smile and said, “You are the one who’s bullying me every day now! When have I ever bullied you? Look, you even bit me yesterday.” Following which, he revealed a mark on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao’s face became red as she turned and fled. The people who were listening to their conversation burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, now that they’re done, it’s our turn!” Tang Wutong’s voice attracted everyone’s attention. They were confused about what she meant.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed angrily before saying, “Hey! Hey! Hey! I’m not letting you fight my wife. Besides, I don’t think you can withstand her blows for even a minute with the current state you’re in. My wife is no pushover.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he clarified, he stepped onto the sparring ground with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei looked at him and asked, “Little junior brother, what are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and replied, “Wutong was very inspired by what she saw, and mentioned to me how females should not be discriminated against. Hence, she challenged me to a duel.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cough! Cough!” Even though a mocking look formed on Bei Bei’s face, he did not dare to say anything. From the look in his eyes, he seemed to be saying, “Good luck, buddy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi did not seem to fear anything as he egged Huo Yuhao on, “Little junior brother, go for it! You must fight for all the men in the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan rolled her eyes and said, “It seems like you’re quite a chauvinist, eh? Come, fight with me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi shook his head fervently before saying, “No way. Forget about it. Use your sleeping technique only after we return to our room. I promise I will definitely not resist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan launched herself into the air as she kicked Xu Sanshi. However, she was already blushing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong moved to the side of the sparring ground on her own. Huo Yuhao was also in no mood to care about what the others were talking about. Because he had been cultivating with Tang Wutong every day, he had a rough understanding of her ability. However, he had never faced her when she was in full fighting mode.</span></p>
