 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Why can’t you think properly? Obviously, there’s only a very ceremonial interaction between Her Highness and Yuhao. Furthermore, her empire is already in such distress. How would she have time for relationships? There must be some official matters. Don’t forget that Yuhao is very symbolic of the Tang Sect. Even eldest senior has to consult his opinions on many matters. In addition, he is very adept at surveillance. I think it might have to do with that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu blinked and said, “Hey, Sister Guyi, I’ve discovered that you’ve become smarter!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi snapped, “I didn’t. It’s just that you got dumb! The more concerned you are, the more distressed you’ll be. You even persuaded me earlier. Why do I feel that you’re sinking in deeper and deeper?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Nan Qiuqiu’s face turned red before she denied the allegation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi smiled, “You know for yourself whether it’s true. Whatever you said to me before, say it to yourself now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----------------</span></p>

There’s nothing I can serve you with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na shook her head and sighed lightly, “I don’t have the mood to deal with all that now. However, the temperature in your room is a little low!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled as he replied, “I was cultivating earlier. Have you forgotten my martial soul?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na was suddenly enlightened. “Oh, right, you have an Ultimate Ice martial soul!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Your Highness, I wonder what you are here for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na lifted her head to look at Huo Yuhao. There was a deep look in her eyes, as if there was some kind of special emotional undulation contained within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was strong, he still grew a little awkward as she stared at him like that. He was too embarrassed to probe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Wei Na kneeled down in front of Huo Yuhao and kowtowed to him. “Yuhao, please save the Heavenly Soul Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s hair was already standing from her stare earlier. However, he was astonished by what she did right now, and immediately rushed forward to lift her up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Highness, what are you doing? We can talk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na allowed Huo Yuhao to lift her up. However, she was already tearing up when she faced Huo Yuhao again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A woman’s tears were very lethal. When he saw the tears in her eyes, Huo Yuhao felt very sour in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na was very awe-inspiring before! But now, she…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought until here, he couldn’t help but sigh and said, “Your Highness, if you have anything to tell me, just tell me directly. I’ll help you in whatever way I can.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thanks.” Wei Na sobbed as she nodded. “I’m sorry, I lost my composure. I’ve been under far too much pressure during this period of time. It feels so good to see you again. I still remember the first time we met!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t say anything, but just sat there quietly. If he really took her as a weak young lady, he would be committing a very foolish error. Princess Jiujiu was already very impressive. However, Huo Yuhao thought more highly of Princess Wei Na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na rubbed her tears away when she saw that he had no reaction. She said, “The Sun Moon Empire has come too abruptly. They’ve completely sealed off our surveillance on them. Initially, I was delighted that we had the Body Sect with us. I even thought that our overall strength was superior to the Star Luo Empire. However, who knew that the Sun Moon Empire’s soul tools were of such impressive standards? When I first saw that great explosion that tore our defensive line apart, how our advanced-tier soul masters were killed and how our enemies were completely fine under their linked defensive barrier, I realized how foolish my thinking was.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She seemed a little distracted and lost as she spoke until here. She wasn’t trying to earn pity from this, but show her true feelings. She had gone through too much over the past few months. The empire had collapsed, countless lives were lost, and everything seemed to be greatly connected to soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After sighing, Wei Na turned her attention to Huo Yuhao. “When I first saw you, I had already realized the importance of soul tools. Honestly speaking, even though we’ve lost very heavily, we would have been in a worse state if not for the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons that the Tang Sect has produced. I heard about your exploits in the Star Luo Empire. You were the one who helped the Star Luo Empire regain control of the Ming Dou Mountain Range, which relieved the pressure on us. Although you didn’t directly participate in the war, you are still a benefactor of the Heavenly Soul Empire. Even though the Heavenly Soul Empire is in decline, I can still make decisions. I can give you a knighthood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was filled with hope as she looked at Huo Yuhao at this point. She waited eagerly for his answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in shock right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Princess Wei Na is indeed very impressive! How did she know I helped the Star Luo Empire regain control of the Ming Dou Mountain Range? The Star Luo Empire wouldn’t have publicly revealed any of the details of that. Furthermore, she also knows that I was offered a knighthood by the Star Luo Empire. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have suggested that to me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A knighthood in the Heavenly Soul Empire is still very good even though the empire is only left with one-third of its original territories. In terms of intelligence, the Heavenly Soul Empire should be ahead of the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head gently and replied, “I’m sorry, Your Highness. Perhaps you already know that I was offered a knighthood by the Star Luo Empire. But I’m doing that because of some personal matters. I’m not being greedy. I appreciate your offer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Princess Wei Na sighed in her heart. She was already very open with her words, but Huo Yuhao still rejected her outright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, you know the situation we’re in. I can offer you more, but it can only happen once we are faring better. If you have any needs, please feel free to tell me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She’s only talking about benefits. It seems like she’s after something big.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pondered for a moment before answering seriously, “Your Highness, I have nothing I need. My needs are the Academy’s needs. As long as the Heavenly Soul Empire continues to support the Academy, everything’s fine. If you need help, feel free to ask me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a stubborn fellow!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na was secretly depressed, but the look on her face turned more and more melancholic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just hope that you can help the Heavenly Soul Empire one day. We won’t forget your contributions. If we can do it and you need it, just tell us. This promise is for forever. Honestly speaking, I’m only here today to build a good relationship with you. You don’t have to think too much.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, I’m here to pull you over. Furthermore, I was determined before I even came. No matter what request you have, we’ll do our best to fulfil it. That includes my body.” Princess Wei Na lowered her voice. When she finished speaking, she had already lowered her head. Her voice was soft, but it was audible enough for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was very beautiful, and she was also being flirtatious now. To any man, she was devastatingly attractive. Even Huo Yuhao was slightly moved when he saw her like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Highness, you don’t have to be like that. We have a common enemy now. Everyone knows that we’re doomed if the Heavenly Soul Empire is destroyed by the Sun Moon Empire. That’s why we’ll do our best to help you. It’s just that you should know that Shrek is working with all the empires. What we can do now is only to stall for time. While the Sun Moon Empire’s soul tools are powerful, they aren’t as strong as the three empires combined. After occupying so much land, they’ll need time to settle in. This time is very valuable to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Wei Na nodded gently before she stood up and said, “Yuhao, I’ve already told you my intentions clearly. Since you don’t have any requests, I’ll leave first. There are still things I need to settle. It’s still the same.
