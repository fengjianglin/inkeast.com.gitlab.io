<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A skeletal head flew towards Huo Yuhao at this moment, and released a yellow circle from its surface. It was coming right at Huo Yuhao as the skull suddenly opened its mouth, and the skeletal head rapidly swelled as it chomped down on Huo Yuhao. The skull itself shone with intense green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could feel a tremendous force pulling on him. This force wasn’t targeted at his body, but at his spirit instead. This terrifying pulling force seemed like it was going to consume his entire spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lives up to his name as an evil soul master! He’s going straight for the spirit...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a lot slower than before. Otherwise, the evil soul master wouldn’t have caught up with him. He didn’t rely on his soul thrusters to widen the gap like before, but tapped the tip of his foot gently on the ground as he spun around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What the evil soul master saw were Huo Yuhao’s glowing eyes. Those eyes had boundless clarity, and two rose-gold beams of light fired from those eyes in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage felt like a giant mallet had hammered onto his spiritual sea in that instant, stirring up torrential waves. He howled agonizingly as green light shone from his body while he plummeted from the sky. The giant skull about to bite down on Huo Yuhao froze in midair at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao vanished into thin air with a flash. He reappeared right in front of the evil Soul Sage as he used his left leg soul bone’s skill, Instant Teleportation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One versus one, and soul master against soul master was what Huo Yuhao was best at. Back when he was still on exchange at the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, he had once relied on his own strength to defeat every single one of their members without taking a single loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His formidable individual fighting strength was displayed once more. Huo Yuhao used Spiritual Shock, and even though his opponent was a Soul Sage and Huo Yuhao didn’t use his Eye of Destiny, the evil Soul Sage bled from his mouth and nose as his spirit was severely damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage fought with his life to recover, trying to regain control of his body. However, Spiritual Shock wasn’t something that was easy to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage stared into Huo Yuhao’s eyes right in front of him. He felt a chill run down his spine, and only then did he realize that his opponent was probably much less simple than he had imagined. In that moment, it was the first time that he hoped soul engineers would come and rescue him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how was that possible? Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was in control of everything, and why would Huo Yuhao make his move if he didn’t find the most suitable opportunity? Since he had made his move, how could he still give his opponent a chance to retaliate?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s seven soul rings immediately disappeared, as those were conjured with Imitation. How could he display his soul rings’ true colors for evil soul masters to see? There were still aerial surveillance soul tools monitoring them from above, as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air around them contorted vigorously as the evil Soul Sage groaned once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Blast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a Spiritual Blast unleashed right at his head. The evil Soul Sage was still affected by what had happened before, and he couldn’t resist Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Blast at all, the torturous pain made him cry out painfully once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light shaped like a whirlpool appeared above his head. It was Spiritual Confusion, another of Huo Yuhao’s powerful single-target control skills. Huo Yuhao would take control until the end, since he had started it. Huo Yuhao had always trained in both offense and control. He mostly played the role of an assault-type soul master, but his control-type abilities were actually more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a Soul Douluo would have trouble enduring through three formidable spiritual-type soul skills used one after another. So what if his opponent was an evil soul master? Evil soul masters’ spirits were stronger than typical soul masters, but that was still useless against Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s entire being turned bluish-green, and an enormous bluish-green pillar of light blasted out from his skeleton. This was the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s Ice Empress’ Wrath, one of the two great soul skills bestowed upon him by her skeleton.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage no longer had any soul power to resist, and his spiritual sea was a complete mess, he had been severely injured. This evil Soul Sage, who had always been so arrogant, immediately became a frozen statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao raised his hand and slapped the frozen statue before he disappeared into the air with it. He activated Imitation once more as he stored the frozen statue inside his storage-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Storage-type soul tools couldn’t store living beings because there was no air inside. Any kind of living being inside would die, or they would have to break out with their own strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this evil Soul Sage was special. He wouldn’t die for a while after being frozen by Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. At least, he wouldn’t need air. Huo Yuhao wanted to leave this place first before dealing with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had accomplished his goal, and he turned as he was about to leave when everything seemed to change around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire’s royal palace, which was in disarray because of the blizzard, suddenly quieted down to the point where the silence was terrifying. Even the streets became completely silent, and that silence was the kind as if all sound had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was just about to leave, but he seemed like he was immobilized as he stood there, motionless. His entire body appeared listless. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t afraid when he was facing an army of a few thousand soldiers, but beads of sweat started to appear on his face within a few short breaths. He tried his best to calm himself down, but his emotions were making him quiver uncontrollably. This pressure came entirely from his spirit, and was the first time Huo Yuhao had experienced something as sinister as this since he began plying his craft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the royal palace didn’t actually have no sounds, and the chaos couldn’t settle down instantly. Everything suddenly grew quiet around him because he couldn’t hear; he couldn’t hear a single person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, footsteps could be heard. Just footsteps, one person’s footsteps. It was the only thing Huo Yuhao could hear with his current sense of hearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A silhouette appeared at the end of the street and slowly walked towards him. There seemed to be a dense fog around him, and even a person as powerful as Huo Yuhao couldn’t see everything about him. Huo Yuhao felt like all he could see was a patch of darkness, like this person was a darkness that had consumed everything around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person had not appeared in Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, and the danger had come so suddenly. Everything was so sudden that Huo Yuhao didn’t know how to defend himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That silhouette wasn’t walking too quickly or too slowly. Huo Yuhao was using Imitation to conceal his tracks, but it had no effect against this person. They finally drew closer, and he was about ten meters away from Huo Yuhao before he stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fog cleared, and Huo Yuhao was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao had a ranking of the most powerful individuals on the Continent, this person before him would be ranked among the top three of those currently alive. At least, he would be ranked as such among those powerful individuals that Huo Yuhao had seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m surprised that it’s you. If Xishui hadn’t told me about your existence, it would have been hard to believe that you’d grown to such a standard after a few short years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice sounded old, and there were tinges of benevolence and warmth, as if he were talking to a friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “I am also surprised to see you here. Greetings, senior Long.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this person who seemed like he controlled everything around them, the person who had appeared before Huo Yuhao, and seemed to have merged into the darkness, was one of the two Ultimate Douluo that he knew of: the Darkness Holy Dragon, the Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao. He was a man who had once shared a reputation with the Dragon God Douluo, Mu En, and they belonged to the same generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart sank right down when he saw Long Xiaoyao. He was very clear that a person like Long Xiaoyao wasn’t someone he could fight against. Long Xiaoyao was powerful to the point that Huo Yuhao couldn’t even properly imagine a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s mindset would probably have been better if this had happened before he had formed his soul core, and that was because he only understood after forming his soul core how much more powerful Ultimate Douluo were compared to Transcendent Douluo. Ultimate Douluo were humans who could fight against the Beast God, Di Tian, whose soul power was entirely present as soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was clad in black, and his hair was all white. He wasn’t much different from when Huo Yuhao had last seen him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Huo Yuhao didn’t expect to see him here was because Long Xiaoyao had never appeared on the Heavenly Soul Empire’s battlefields in any of the intelligence that Huo Yuhao knew about. At this moment, Long Xiaoyao’s appearance had undoubtedly severed every single one of Huo Yuhao’s escape routes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Youngster, I still vividly remember the wager we had. You gave me a pleasant surprise back then, but you have given me so many more pleasant surprises at this moment. You are a Soul Sage, and judging from your soul power undulations, you’re not far from becoming a Soul Douluo. Brother Mu has taken in an excellent disciple!” Long Xiaoyao seemed to lament a little as he spoke. He placed his hands behind his back and gazed into the sky. Who knew what he was thinking about?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t mention my teacher. If teacher were still alive, he would be ashamed to stand with you,” Huo Yuhao answered coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His strength couldn’t even begin to compare to Long Xiaoyao’s strength. However, Huo Yuhao was not afraid, as strength and authority couldn’t bend his will. The Darkness Holy Dragon, Long Xiaoyao, was following the Holy Ghost Church, and that was something that Huo Yuhao held in contempt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao frowned and said, “You youngsters don’t understand matters of the older generations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed coldly and said, “No, I do not understand. All I know is that you have chosen to take the side of the evildoers, and who knows how many people you’ve helped the Holy Ghost Church massacre. Many of the things that the Holy Ghost Church has done are a result of your existence. I really don’t understand. At your level, why do you allow yourself to be used by evil soul masters, and why do you help them destroy lives and create calamities? Do you know that if this is allowed to continue, and if the Sun Moon Empire conquers the continent, the Holy Ghost Church’s next target will be to take over? When that happens, all of humanity will probably become the Holy Ghost Church’s slaves, and they will give their lives and everything they have for evil soul masters to cultivate. Is Hell on the mortal world something you want to see?”</span></p>
