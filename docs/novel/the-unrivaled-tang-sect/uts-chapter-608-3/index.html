 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran released a cold grunt and said, “I have to admit that you’re probably the brightest star within your generation. But how dare you try to infiltrate my palace and attack me on your own! Do you really think that the two of you can escape from my palace alive today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled. “Your Majesty, you must be mistaken. You should be the one answering that question instead of me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An image suddenly formed behind Huo Yuhao’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single soul engineer present was already extremely tense after Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had appeared before them. They instantly attacked Huo Yuhao once they saw the transformation behind his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Powerful streaks of light were projected towards Huo Yuhao as powerful soul power fluctuations rippled across the entire dining hall, causing the entire compound to vibrate vigorously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few of the sharper soul engineers decided against attacking Huo Yuhao. They chose to direct their attacks towards a compound which was outside of the dining hall. They wanted to create a commotion to alert the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion, which was stationed outside. As long as they could alert them, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong would have no choice but to flee. After all, they believed that they would not be able to fight against the entire Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they were shocked to discover how their attacks, which were fired in different directions ended up flying towards Huo Yuhao anyway. The rays of light that surrounded them started to contort and twist in a mysterious way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mystical icy blue vortex started to revolve before Huo Yuhao. The rays of light in the room disintegrated into nothingness after they were caught by the vortex. At this instant, the figure behind Huo Yuhao formed completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure was a beautiful lady. While she had the torso and head of a female, she had a mystical fishtail on the lower half of her body. The mermaid had a pair of big eyes as she smiled at the soul engineers before her. Following which, she allowed her beautiful singing to enshroud the entire hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very next instant, Huo Yuhao’s soul rings started to light up. There was no longer a need for him to conceal the colors of his rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His first soul ring was no longer masked in white. It was presented in its original brilliant golden color. Huo Yuhao’s least impressive soul rings were black. However, the most common soul rings he had were red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao transmitted his low voice into the soul engineers’ ears. “Spiritual Blast!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle ripple swept across the hall as an intense light was released from the bodies of Xu Tianran and his soul engineers. All of their defensive soul tools which were designed to block spiritual attacks released a blinding light. At that instant, the entire hall was brightly lit by all of their soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that wasn’t all. Loud shattering sounds could be heard right after everyone was blinded by the lights from the soul tools. Everyone, including Xu Tianran, lost a spiritual defensive soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were, in fact, two soul engineers whose spiritual defensive soul tools did not shatter. The reason was that they did not even have a spiritual defensive soul tool to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, spiritual defensive soul tools were one of the hardest soul tools to make among all Class 9 soul tools. This was why Zhongli Wu was very unwilling to concede to Ju Zi’s terms back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why not every Class 9 soul engineer was equipped with spiritual defensive soul tools. After all, it was fairly rare to encounter soul masters or soul beasts who were capable of unleashing spiritual attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, those two soul engineers who were not equipped with spiritual defensive soul tools had to pay for their mistake tonight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they had tried to counter the Spiritual Blast by increasing their spiritual power to the maximum their Spiritual Seas could generate, they still stood no chance against Huo Yuhao. After all, Huo Yuhao had just acquired the Evileye Tyrant’s powerful spiritual soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood started to gush from the noses and mouths of the two Class 9 soul engineers after they released a grunt. Both of their bodies started to sway to the left and right as they tried to steady themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they were shocked by how powerful Huo Yuhao’s attack was, those soul engineers tried their best to retaliate against him. However, it was at this very instant that Huo Yuhao launched a second wave of Spiritual Blast. Even though the second wave was not as strong as the first, it was equally frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang! Bang!” Two loud explosive souls could be heard as the heads of the two soul engineers who did not possess spiritual defensive soul tools exploded. Their blood and pieces of their brains splattered across the floor of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no one could afford to show any sign of concern for them. They were already busy trying to fend off Huo Yuhao’s second wave of Spiritual Blast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Merfolk Duet allowed him to launch his spiritual attack twice consecutively. This made it an incredibly strong soul skill! The Merfolk Duet was definitely one of the strongest spiritual soul skills Huo Yuhao possessed. It was probably only second to the soul skills which the Three-Eyed Golden Lion had given him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao released his second wave of Spiritual Blast, every single soul engineer present released a painful grunt. They stumbled backward as they tried their best to use their spiritual defensive soul tools to block the blast. However, their soul tools were already shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was the only person who was somewhat fine. After all, four of the eleven Class 9 defensive soul tools on his body were spiritual defensive soul tools. On top of that, these four soul tools were definitely the highest quality soul tools within the entire Sun Moon Empire. Even though he looked a little shaken by the attacks, the two Spiritual Blasts had only destroyed one of his soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was stumbling backward, Xu Tianran’s chest emitted a powerful beam of light as it sent him flying backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of whether it was in the palace or the temporary palace, Xu Tianran had always prepared several backup plans for him to flee in times of trouble. Right now, he was certain that he, along with his soul engineers, had already entered Huo Yuhao’s powerful domain. The only way he could survive under such circumstances was to use the secret passageway under the floor, which was not far away from him. The passageway had been programmed to transmit a distress signal to his troops on the outside the moment he accessed it. Hence, as long as he was able to reach the passageway, there was a good chance for him to stay alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, Huo Yuhao was not prepared to let Xu Tianran do that. After all, he would not have come with just the fighting power he had just showcased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After releasing two Spiritual Blasts, Huo Yuhao began to unleash his other attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom! Boom! Boom!” A series of explosions could be heard once again. Just when everyone was still trying to recover from the Spiritual Blasts, loud explosions echoed in the hall again. However, this time around, the attacks were not coming from outside of their bodies. Instead, they were coming from within their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The frozen blood and soul power in their bodies had suddenly exploded intensely! This was something that caught all of them by surprise!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone, including Xu Tianran, had drunk the wine which was contaminated by Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the wine was not poisoned. It simply contained Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that it was exceptionally hard for a soul master to sneak his or her soul power into the drinks of Titled Douluo. The soul engineers were all Titled Douluo, and were very sensitive to any soul power or spiritual power fluctuations around them. Not anyone would be able to pull off what he had done. In fact, Huo Yuhao had only managed to contaminate their drinks because he had concealed his actions extremely well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was able to conceal his own aura and his soul power fluctuations with his powerful abilities. His Yin Yang Complement soul cores’ soul power vortex also possessed the ability to conceal its traces. Coupled with his intentional efforts to mask the fluctuations of his soul power, Huo Yuhao was able to release seven Ultimate Ice soul power vortexes into their cups without raising any alarms. Hence, Xu Tianran and the soul engineers had ingested his soul power along with the wine in their cups.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Ultimate Ice soul power was able to conceal itself, and explode only after it had entered their bodies. Hence, it was too late by the time they discovered that they had ingested something. The only reason why it could remain obscure was that Huo Yuhao’s soul power was now infused with his spiritual power. Hence, he could continue to control the soul power vortexes even though they were away from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that the blood and soul power in their bodies were frozen in ice, Huo Yuhao could use his legendary soul skill on them. Ice Explosion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a Titled Douluo would not be able to handle an Ice Explosion taking place from within them. Xu Tianran’s plethora of defensive soul tools would not be able to protect him from within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the other five people immediately released a cry of pain after explosions took place within their bodies. They instantly fell to the ground and lost all ability to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the day, a Titled Douluo’s body was incredibly tough. Huo Yuhao was unable to put too much soul power into their wine, or else they would have discovered the vortex in their drinks. Hence, the explosion was not powerful enough to take their lives. However, the intense pain was not something they could handle easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao made his move, Tang Wutong also began to take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She instantly teleported behind the two men who were standing behind Xu Tianran. She released a radiant purple-gold glow as she unleashed two punches with both of her fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s guards were all very powerful individuals. However, how could they resist their opponents when they were at the level of an Ultimate Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blinding golden light was emitted as the human-shaped soul tools released a series of explosions. However, none of their soul tools were able to fend off the power of Tang Wutong’s fist, which was releasing a dragon’s roar. When Tang Wutong’s punch eventually landed on their human-shaped soul tools, the outcome was already decided.</span></p>
