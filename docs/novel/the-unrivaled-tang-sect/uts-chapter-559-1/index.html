 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Snow Empress’ ice crystal rose, his soul power gathered more and more around his chest. The pain he suffered became more and more excruciating. His spiritual soul core also struggled more too. When the two feelings combined, they greatly multiplied the pain that Huo Yuhao was being subjected to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress’ strength was still very stable. Huo Yuhao’s spine was his core, while his ribs were his support. Overall, they formed a protective soul barrier. However, Huo Yuhao discovered that the Ice Empress was no longer isolating all her spiritual power. Instead, she poured in one small streak of her spiritual power. This streak was a hundred to a thousand times thinner than a hair. This streak of soul power landed on Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this happened, the revolution of his Ultimate Ice soul power became much slower than it was when he absorbed soul power. However, it was still revolving persistently. That streak of spiritual power was influenced by it, and was continuously being lashed at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was truly getting close. It was turning from resistance into fusion. It was just that the clash of the two parties left Huo Yuhao feeling much more pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His soul core was expanding, while the spiritual power that the Ice Empress unleashed was also strengthening. However, it was strengthening at a slower speed than the increase in the soul core’s size. Huo Yuhao was in even more excruciating pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King continued to unleash his power, consolidating Huo Yuhao’s passageways and bones. His bones were still fine, since they had the support of the Ice Jade Empress’ backbone. However, his heart and lungs were inside his body. There were also many important passageways. As they were continuously under attack, Huo Yuhao was inevitably under great torture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress’ ice crystal rose to a spot which was less than three inches from that ball of soul power before it stopped. It hung below his thoracic cage. In this way, she was able to pour out her soul power at a much faster speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the size of her Ultimate Ice soul core was about the size of a jujube, it stopped expanding. However, it became brighter and brighter as it kept on revolving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even by observing Huo Yuhao from the outside, one could discover that his backbone had turned jade-green, and there was a ball of bluish-white light in his chest that was becoming brighter and brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pain was only getting worse, but Huo Yuhao’s control remained very stable. If this were another soul master, he wouldn’t be able to bear the pain at this magnitude. At least, he wouldn’t be able to maintain control so well. However, Huo Yuhao remained unmoved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao was in his closed-door cultivation, Shrek City also started to get busy. Inside the city, there were all types of installations, which the Tang Sect had provided a lot of help with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Huo Yuhao has retreated into closed-door cultivation? What about the three soul engineer legions in Shrek? Where are they?” Xian Lin’er stood in front of Xu Sanshi and appeared very anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Xu Sanshi was also a little speechless. When he had returned to the academy, Huo Yuhao had only let them out. The three soul engineer legions were still resting in his spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao had retreated into closed-door cultivation. Bei Bei and Tang Wutong were not around either. In fact, Xu Sanshi didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er’s aura turned a little unbalanced. “Since when has Yuhao become so unreliable? What time is it? Why is he in closed-door cultivation? What is he doing?” Xian Lin’er paced up and down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was also a little helpless. Bei Bei and Huo Yuhao were both not around. He was the one taking care of matters in the Tang Sect right now, but he had to face Xian Lin’er’s wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come, bring me to find Yuhao. If he’s not too deep in his closed-door cultivation, I’ll ask him to release the three soul engineer legions first before we plan. Do you know that there are more than six hundred thousand soldiers from the Sun Moon Empire situated fifty kilometers from Shrek City? They have at least eight soul engineer legions there watching us. They are ready to launch an attack against us at any time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was in a daze. He really didn’t know. After hearing Xian Lin’er’s words, his goosebumps also stood. “However, Dean Xian, Yuhao is in closed-door cultivation. What should I do if I disturb him and cause him to run amok?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er was feeling more and more depressed now. She had always been very concerned about Huo Yuhao. However, how could she not be anxious right now, given that Huo Yuhao chose to retreat into closed-door cultivation but didn’t let the three soul engineer legions out of his demiplane?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Huo Yuhao didn’t do this on purpose. He had forgotten about it. He had been very immersed in his thoughts, and thinking about how he should deal with the current situation. After he thought of a plan, he immediately executed it. However, he forgot how important the three soul engineer legions were to Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really think I don’t know how important his closed-door cultivation is? However, this concerns the life and death of the academy. If the Sun Moon Empire attacks, what should we do if our defense isn’t strong enough?” Xian Lin’er was furious as she asked, “What is Yuhao thinking? Bei Bei and Tang Wutong aren’t around either. Have the three of them gone mad?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dean Xian, don’t panic. It won’t help even if you’re anxious.” Jiang Nannan opened her mouth. She walked in front of Xian Lin’er and said, “Dean Yan, why don’t we do it this way? We’ll bring you to where Yuhao is first. Given your cultivation, you should be able to sense his condition. If you think he can be woken up, we’ll do so. If not, I believe you won’t insist on it either. After all, if Yuhao runs amok, he wouldn’t be able to recite the incantations that link to the spectral demiplane. When that happens, you won’t be able to recall the three soul engineer legions either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er stomped her foot. “We can only do it that way. Bring me to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone else did something like this, Xian Lin’er would have rushed in, given her temperament. However, she was a little helpless against the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect’s development over the past few years was very significant to Shrek City. Without the Tang Sect’s weapons, Shrek Academy wouldn’t have been able to survive the beast wave started by the Great Star Dou Forest. As a result, the Tang Sect’s status in Shrek City had continuously been on the rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, more than a year ago, Huo Yuhao had used many valuable medicines to cultivate the Qiankun Fortune Pill. He even selflessly gave one to the academy. This helped Elder Xuan to successfully achieve a breakthrough and become an Ultimate Douluo. She and Yan Shaozhe had also consolidated their own foundations, and could possibly become Ultimate Douluo in the future. They didn’t forget this favor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why Xian Lin’er suppressed her rage even though Huo Yuhao felt very unreliable right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan’s guidance, Xian Lin’er came to the Soul Tool Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan both knew where Huo Yuhao’s laboratory was. Very soon, they arrived. However, they were stopped before they got close. He Caitou was the one who stopped them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sanshi, Nannan, what are the two of you doing? Little junior is in closed-door cultivation in the laboratory. No one can get close to him. What if you disturb him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Xuan Ziwen appeared to be very unconcerned about Huo Yuhao’s closed-door cultivation, he had actually informed He Caitou when Huo Yuhao began his closed-door cultivation. He Caitou immediately dropped everything he was doing, and came over to protect him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi laughed bitterly. “Caitou, something big has happened. Little junior forgot to release the three soul engineer legions. That’s why Dean Xian is here to find him. How far along in his closed-door cultivation is he now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou was stunned for a moment. He looked at the displeased Xian Lin’er and laughed bitterly, “I’m not sure either. However, we must not disturb him. You can sense that the aura he’s released is terrifying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he pointed to the laboratory, which wasn’t far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er squinted and slowly released her spiritual power close to Huo Yuhao’s laboratory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan were standing close to He Caitou. Although they didn’t do anything obvious, they were actually subconsciously helping He Caitou stop Xian Lin’er. If she raged and planned to find him, they could stop her too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At such a critical moment, they had to side with their junior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they had planned for naught. Xian Lin’er only sensed a little before her expression changed greatly, and she took a step back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The laboratory was sealed very well. The thick metal isolated most of the aura. However, Xian Lin’er could sense the changes that were going on in the laboratory if even only a little bit of it leaked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, the aura inside was terrifying. It was chaotic and terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is it so chaotic? What is Yuhao doing? Don’t tell me he’s run amok?” Xian Lin’er exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she said this, He Caitou and the other two were immediately shocked. If Huo Yuhao really ran amok, it would be a disaster for the entire Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was anxious. “Run amok? Dean Xian, are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er was in a daze, and she furrowed her brow. She continued to silently sense what was going on. The longer she sensed, the more her expression changed. After a brief moment, her expression suddenly changed dramatically. “I know what he’s doing. He’s actually going for his second soul core. No wonder his aura is so chaotic. It’s just... why is his attempt so different from Elder Xuan?”</span></p>
