 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

However, if she did that, she would be unable to participate in the group round later on. It was the fifth round of the individual round, which also meant that her side had already lost four rounds. The only way to victory was in the group round. Furthermore, this was contingent on at least two victories in the individual round. She had to keep up her fighting abilities, so she conceded defeat.</span></p>

Her heart was filled with a sense of profound respect. They wanted to clear all obstacles for the team from Shrek Academy! The Clearjade Sect was powerful enough to threaten Shrek Academy. They were trying to weaken it as much as possible.</span></p>

However, this was not the case for the Clearjade Sect. Their captain, who had been sitting firmly in her seat, suddenly stood up. She stared coldly at Xiao Xiao and then at the youth next to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth stood up too.

At the same time, two yellow, three purple, and one black soul ring rose around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul Emperor!</span></p>

When they noticed their opponent’s Soul Emperor-level cultivation, some in the Tang Sect frowned. If Xue Bing was a Soul Emperor, and if their captain was a Soul Emperor, this meant that their team had two Soul Emperors! In the last tournament, other than Shrek Academy and the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, there was no other team with this combination. They had never expected to meet such a team in the pre-trials of the tournament. This meant that while the Clearjade Sect was not as powerful as the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, they were not too far off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao looked at her six-ringed opponent, but remained fearless. She maintained her previous tempo as she approached him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Xue Bing rushed toward her, an emerald-green light started to shine from metallic green rings on his body. In total, there were six metal rings. These six metal rings gave off a warm light. As the distance between Xue Bing and Xiao Xiao closed, his body started to undergo a sudden change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Layers of green scales started to appear from underneath his skin. When he first released his martial soul, he was able to use his soul power to suppress the change in it, so it only revealed itself now. Not only that, but his also body started to elongate, and as his body arched in mid-air, it extended by more than 10 meters. The six soul rings that surrounded his bucket-thick python-like body started to spin too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His first and third soul rings started to shine. His body surged forward as he came smashing down onto Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of martial soul is this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao looked stunned. This was evidently not a typical martial soul, and her opponent was not yet a Soul Sage. Naturally, he would not be able to reveal his Martial Soul True Body. However, in his current shape, was this not like a Martial Soul True Body? How could this be possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While she was shocked, Xiao Xiao’s movements did not slow. She retreated quickly, and her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron appeared. It suddenly enlarged as it came crashing down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Bing had no intention of dodging it. Instead, he used his huge python-like body and clashed head-on with the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What happened next shocked Xiao Xiao greatly. After her immense cauldron smashed into Xue Bing, it was actually sent flying away. Xue Bing’s body continued to descend onto Xiao Xiao. He opened his mouth to reveal rows of fangs as he tried to swallow her whole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s right, this is the power of a Martial Soul True Body.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she came from Shrek Academy, Xiao Xiao’s knowledge was wide. From the force of the crash just now, she was able to ascertain her suspicions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were not a Martial Soul True Body, how could he knock her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron so far away?</span></p>

How could this be possible? A twenty-year-old seven-ringed Soul Sage! In the entire history of the Douluo Continent, this had never happened before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Xiao Xiao was shocked, her body did not freeze. The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, which had disappeared after it was sent flying away, re-appeared next to her. Xiao Xiao’s gaze turned serious, and she stretched her hands apart. Instantly, the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron split into three. She was protected in the center by the three copies of the cauldron. At the same time, her fourth soul ring started to shine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each of the three cauldrons started to shine with an intense black light. Three rays of black light shot into the sky. They met in mid-air, and then crashed down onto the body of the huge python.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seal!” Xiao Xiao made an odd gesture with her hands. Her body started to float upward from the center of the three cauldrons, and shine with dazzling runes. Her thousand-year fourth soul skill gave off an unparalleled aura of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The body of the huge python that descended from the sky was too enormous, so there was no way of dodging it. The moment the green light from its body touched the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron’s black light, it disappeared. Following that, an odd scene appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xue Bing’s huge body started to shrink quickly as it fell from the sky. The three cauldrons started to move away from each other as they formed the shape of an equilateral triangle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao stood near one of the cauldrons. Her hands made an odd heart-like shape.</span></p>

It was still in the shape of a huge snake, but it seemed it had been bound the black light, and was twisting about intensely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cauldron’s Seal! This was Xiao Xiao’s fourth soul skill, a very powerful control-type soul skill!</span></p>

In the past, a cauldron was an important symbol of the state. This skill was akin to Cauldron Quake, which Xiao Xiao could activate by combining her first and second soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao’s fourth soul skill came from a mystical soul beast. When the soul ring of this soul beast fused with her, an anomaly occurred.</span></p>

It was a powerful soul beast that brimmed with a severe aura that could suppress evil. However, as pure Xiezhis had long been extinct, this soul beast only had some Xiezhi blood in it. The thousand-year soul beast Xiao Xiao had killed had looked more like a goat.</span></p>

This thousand-year soul skill now had an extremely powerful sealing ability, able to suppress auras and seal all beings. Once a being was sealed, two outcomes would arise. First, it would be sealed for three seconds. During this time, Xiao Xiao could not attack it, as she had to control the soul skill. However, in those three seconds, the opponent’s soul power would be suppressed by the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, and at least thirty percent of it would be eroded away. No matter how much more powerful the opponent was, as long as it was not two levels more powerful than Xiao Xiao, her Cauldron’s Seal would work.</span></p>

The result then would be even more terrifying. After it had been suppressed by Cauldron’s Seal, it would be sealed within the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, and only released upon Xiao Xiao’s command.</span></p>

If it wanted to imprison another, it had to release the first one!</span></p>

As she faced off against a more powerful opponent, she finally decided to use it.</span></p>

As it was naturally powerful and could devour even lions and tigers, anyone that got trapped by one would be doomed.</span></p>

The reason why he could reveal his Martial Soul True Body was because of the six metal rings that had appeared on his body. They were six Class 5 soul tools, but they belonged to a set. Together, they were powerful enough to activate the hidden strength of a soul master’s martial soul and give rise to an increase in soul power. Xue Bing, who was originally a Soul Emperor, could use the metallic rings to activate his Martial Soul True Body. How could he not delight in it? He had immediately abandoned his original close-combat soul tool and decided to cultivate this set of metallic rings wholeheartedly. By using it in this tournament, he hoped to achieve an earth-shattering success!</span></p>
