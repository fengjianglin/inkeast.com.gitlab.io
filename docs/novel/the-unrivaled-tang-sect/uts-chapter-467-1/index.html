 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A twenty-thousand man army was considered rather large. Nan Qiuqiu’s estimation was accurate. After Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Detection to scan the place, he could basically confirm that the size of the army was between twenty to twenty-five thousand men.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He continued to advance further in. He moved his way past the tents at the perimeter and got closer to the dark red tents. At the same time, he strengthened his Spiritual Detection and sensed any changes that occured around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this were an ordinary army, they couldn’t possibly threaten Huo Yuhao. However, things were different with the presence of the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. There had to be a Class 9 soul engineer in this soul engineer legion. Furthermore, the tactics of such an advanced-tier soul engineer legion could threaten a Titled Douluo, much less Huo Yuhao. He had to be careful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he moved forward, he discovered through his Spiritual Detection that there was a huge tent in the center of all the tents. It was also dark red, but it was as large as the commander’s tent. There were even obvious golden phoenix images on it. It was extremely crowded inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What left Huo Yuhao the most shocked was that he sensed something wrong just as his Spiritual Detection came closer to the tent. He immediately stopped his detection when he discovered a spiritual barrier around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for the fact that he had just formed his soul core, and the sensitivity of his Spiritual Detection had increased significantly, he wouldn’t have discovered the presence of this spiritual barrier. If he had tried to probe further in, he would have likely been discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder it was a beast lord-ranked soul engineer legion. The defense of the commander’s tent was extremely tight; there was even a spiritual barrier around it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was naturally not disappointed because of that. He silently inched forward and drew closer and closer to the tent. It was only by getting close to it that he could obtain the most reliable information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, his spiritual power also entered the rest of the other tents for detection purposes. The members of this soul engineer legion were indeed all female soul engineers. Furthermore, their cultivations were quite strong. They all possessed at least four soul rings, some of them even possessing five or six!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the slightly bigger dark red tents, there were even seven-ringed soul engineers. Such soul engineers were considered quite strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he inched forward, Huo Yuhao circumvented a few more oscillation detectors. Finally, he stopped thirty meters away from that huge tent. This was the furthest he could go, given the presence of the spiritual barrier. If he moved any further forward, he would most certainly be discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t go any closer, or I’ll be discovered. However, I can’t get any reliable information if I don’t get closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He found a corner and squatted down. At the same time, he unleashed his Spiritual Detection laterally around the commander’s tent. He was trying to survey everything that was going around the tent, and waiting for his opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black soul core of his Eye of Destiny subtly appeared. His aura of destiny spread out, and Huo Yuhao shut his eyes. He sensed everything silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given the standard of his current spiritual power, almost the entire base was engulfed by his spiritual power, apart from the commander’s tent. He was definitely more effective than the aerial surveillance soul tools in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao’s expression soon turned weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The members of this Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion were all female. It was already very late. Some of the female soul engineers toned down on their clothes after dinner. Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was all-engulfing. When the images of countless women dressed rather lightly entered his spiritual world, Huo Yuhao felt as if he were about to go crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his expression turned momentarily weird, he started to blush. After this, he frantically retracted his Spiritual Detection. He only kept it in the air, and stopped inspecting the conditions inside the tents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief when he could no longer sense their bodies. He continued to look towards the commander’s tent, and silently waited for his opportunity. Although there was a spiritual barrier blocking him here, he didn’t believe that he didn’t stand a chance at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dim lights flashed, and an icy-cold look rose in his eyes. As he silently waited, he was also observing things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, his opportunity arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few female soul engineers dressed in red armor walked towards the commander’s tent. Their armor was well-fitted and top-quality. Every one of their suits of armor was custom-made. There were even buckle-like accessories and slots on them. Obviously, these slots were used to connect to different soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although these female soul engineers weren’t particularly ravishing, they still looked like suave heroines!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, they arrived in front of the commander’s tent. Unlike what Huo Yuhao feared, they walked through the spiritual barrier and into the tent as if there was nothing there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power had engulfed everywhere else nearby. This was why he had an acute feeling of everything around him. He immediately discovered a layer of light shining from each of them when they passed through the spiritual barrier. These layers of light were extremely weak, but there were obvious spiritual undulations coming from them. When they passed through the spiritual barrier, they demonstrated their compatibility with the spiritual barrier before they managed to pass through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Impressive!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of soul tool research and manufacturing, the Sun Moon Empire was indeed superior to the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. This wasn’t an extremely impressive piece of research, but the attention to detail was great. While this spiritual barrier didn’t have any fighting use, it was still very practical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since this was the case, these soul engineers must possess some kind of special soul tool on their bodies that helped them disperse the spiritual undulations. This meant that Huo Yuhao could sneak in with someone else if he possessed such a soul tool. It would help him avoid all the spiritual barriers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought of that, Huo Yuhao started to take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the surveillance of his Spiritual Detection, it was definitely not difficult for him to find a suitable soul engineer. Huo Yuhao quickly made his way around a few tents while continuing to use his Imitation to conceal himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, he found a member of the soul engineer legion not far from the side of the military base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To ensure that he could get what he wanted, Huo Yuhao intentionally selected a Class 4 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Huo Yuhao’s eyes, a Class 4 soul engineer was an easy target. He crept closer and closer. Given his Imitation, he wouldn’t be discovered even if he got right up to his opponent’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao controlled his body temperature very well through a combination of his ice-type soul power and Imitation. Very soon, he was behind that female soul engineer. He swiftly hacked at her neck with his palm. At the same time, he unleashed his Spiritual Interference Domain and engulfed both him and the female soul engineer inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his palm hit her neck, he immediately discovered something amiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gentle yet resilient wave of soul power immediately rose. Following this, the female soul engineer’s body shone with a streak of red light. The appearance of this red light was very sudden. However, the moment it appeared, a deafening alarm also immediately reverberated throughout the entire base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red light wasn’t sufficient to resist Huo Yuhao’s right hand. The Class 4 soul engineer collapsed to the ground amid the deafening alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s going on? Not only does she have an automatic defensive soul tool on her body, but she also has an alarm-type soul tool with her?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was shocked, but he didn’t have time to hesitate anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He bent over and quickly picked the soul engineer up. He was going to flee before deciding on what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being discovered by such a strong soul engineer legion, there were many methods that could be used to detect his location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, something else caught him by surprise again. When his hands touched the unconscious female soul engineer, another layer of red light shone from her body. Following this, this layer of red light seemed to cause more than ten different beams of red light around them to shine at the same time too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only did this red light protect this female soul engineer, but it also engulfed a large area around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s a linked defensive soul tool. It can still work after she’s struck unconscious?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was depressed!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I have to go. Otherwise I’ll be in trouble.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>

He quickly shot up and charged out like an arrow. He was about to collide with the red lights in front of him, but snorted coldly and lifted his left hand before smacking it out in front of him. A strong aura of cold was instantly unleashed. The chill was very strong when it first appeared. However, it soon toned down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as the temperature turned from extremely cold to normal, the red lights in front of him weakened. Huo Yuhao waved his hand and unleashed the destructive strength of his Darkgolden Terrorclaws. He forced open a slit in the barrier that the red lights had formed before charging out and up towards the sky.</span></p>

This was because there were many oscillation detectors scanning in his direction right now.</span></p>

If he were any slower, the earlier linked defensive soul formation would have become stronger, and it would have become impossible for him to escape. He would have landed in the enemy’s hands!</span></p>
