 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Streaks of Ultimate Ice energy ascended like sashes as they streamed towards the spiritual soul core. It seemed like they were planning to retaliate against the spiritual soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Huo Yuhao could not see was how the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was already trembling intensely as it tried to release its Star Anise Icy Coagulation with the maximum possible power. Its every single leaf had become transparent as it tried to devour every single bit of ice-type elemental energy within the room. During this process, strong gusts of icy wind started to blow within the room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai’s protection over Huo Yuhao’s body had also suddenly stopped. Countless tiny balls of white energy were surging towards Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice soul core and fusing with it under its control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s torso bone was also releasing jade green fluid towards the Ultimate Ice soul core under the Ice Empress’ control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In my name, Spirit of the Icesky Snow Lady, Fuse!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Booommm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s entire body started to tremble. He felt as if his chest and entire body had exploded at this instant, rendering him incapable of thinking. His entire intent and consciousness seemed to be ravaged by a mysterious force. Along with his spiritual soul core, his mind went completely blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Slaughtering Grounds within the Core Region of the Great Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lake of Life was so still that it resembled a gigantic emerald gem. It was surrounded by plants that were full of vitality. One could sense the life energy that the Lake of Life was emitting by simply breathing the air around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, this was forbidden ground for all living things which possessed power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boooomm” An intense explosion interrupted mother nature’s peace and serenity. A black figure rose from the center of the Lake of Life, sending water splashing everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lake water was immediately transformed into mist, which encircled the black figure before being absorbed by him. Following which, the black figure continued to float in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His long hair drooped down by the sides of his face, while his pitch black pupils radiated a golden glow. However, the depths of his pupils revealed how he was currently shocked beyond belief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on? Why can’t I sense his existence anymore?” The handsome man muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the world’s strongest individual and the champion amongst the Ten Great Savage Beasts, Di Tian had always been extremely confident in his abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how strong humans were able to become, no one could ever move him from his title as the world’s strongest individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian floated towards the side of the lake as he began to think about the different possibilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He moved his right hand in the air in a mysterious parabolic manner as a black rune instantly appeared in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black fog permeated the air as the golden glow in Di Tian’s eyes flickered. However, a worried expression suddenly formed on his face in the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, I can’t seem to sense him anymore. I wonder why…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something extremely important must have happened in order to rouse him from his sleep. And this matter must concern the future of the entire Great Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His aura has disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was clearly able to sense Huo Yuhao’s aura just a while ago. However, Huo Yuhao—who possessed his reverse scale—had seemed to suddenly vanish without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his eyes, the only possible explanation for this was death!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he knew that his reverse scale was not only able to monitor Huo Yuhao, but also protect him at the same time. The moment he was in any danger, his reverse scale would immediately inform him. And as the Beast God, he would definitely be able to rescue Huo Yuhao at that instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Di Tian admired Huo Yuhao for creating the Spirit Pagoda and temporarily alleviating the conflict between humans and soul beasts, Huo Yuhao was ultimately a human who had the potential to be used in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could not afford to allow him to die, because Huo Yuhao’s body contained the power of destiny, which had belonged to the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. As long as he was alive, the power of destiny would continue to keep watch over the Great Star Dou Forest. Even though it would not be as strong as when the Three-Eyed Golden Lion was still around, it was still of great use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he could not allow Huo Yuhao to become too strong. He was a human who was incredibly gifted. If he were to become a God one day, the Great Star Dou Forest would also lose the protection of the power of destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Di Tian had been keeping a close eye on Huo Yuhao’s transformations and growth. Once Huo Yuhao was capable of attracting the attention of the God Realm, he would seal off his power without any hesitation to stop him from communicating with the God Realm. He would not even care about what Huo Yuhao’s opinions were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There is a limit to how strong a human can become. I am already at the limits of mortality in this world. This is no way a human can defeat me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was under these circumstances that Huo Yuhao’s aura had suddenly vanished. Di Tian had no answer to this phenomenon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was extremely confident in his reverse scale. After all, it was not just any normal scale. It could essentially act as a clone. With the help of his reverse scale, he could accurately pinpoint where Huo Yuhao was, and use his mastery of spatial laws to transport portions of his energy to that location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was not only unable to sense Huo Yuhao’s presence, but also the aura of his own reverse scale. How could he not be surprised?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he were unable to sense the existence of his own reverse scale, he would naturally be unable to transfer his powers and check on Huo Yuhao’s situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something is wrong. There must be a problem somewhere.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian squinted. He must not allow the power of destiny to escape from his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There must be something going on at Huo Yuhao’s side. He must have used some ability to temporarily cut off the connection between</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">me and my reverse scale. This ability must be the reason why I can’t sense him. There must be a reason why he’s trying to cut off this connection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I must find out what’s going on. There’s no way I can let this continue without knowing what’s happening. His last known location was Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Worst comes to worst, I will break his arms and legs and keep him with me in the Great Star Dou Forest forever. I will then figure out a way to extend his life. Even though the power of destiny might experience some problems, that’s still better than losing it entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Di Tian took a step forward, he suddenly vanished into thin air. When he reappeared again, he was already a thousand meters in the air. His figure flickered once again as the sky tore open to reveal a gaping hole. He stepped into the hole before the hole sealed up. Once again, the powerful Beast God had disappeared. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City was already very close to the Great Star Dou Forest after its expansion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a minute had passed, Di Tian’s black figure reappeared in mid-air as he triggered Shrek City’s deafening alarm system.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul tools from Tang Sect and the Shrek Academy’s Soul Tool Hall had been developing rapidly. They now possessed aerial surveillance soul tools both on the ground and in the air. However, compared to the Sun Moon Empire, they were still lacking quite a bit in both the quantity and quality of their soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surveillance soul tools within Shrek City were immediately able to pick up the presence of an individual in the sky. Multiple soul tools from the ground and the city walls instantly locked their weapons onto the black colored figure</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how there was only one intruder, ten soul engineers from the city defense army leapt into the sky as they tried to chase the black figure down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph!” A cold grunt echoed in the air as the entire sky appeared to tremble at that instant. The ten figures which had just started to ascend into the sky immediately felt a frightening force pressing onto them from the sky. They were actually forced back to the ground by this mysterious force. Because they were falling from a relatively high altitude, quite a few of them were injured by the fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get Huo Yuhao to come out. I have a few questions for him.” Di Tian put his hands behind his back as he floated in mid-air. He did not seem to show any care or concern for Shrek City’s defense system.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound of the alarm system suddenly changed from its previous piercing sound into a rapid wailing sound. This was a sign that a powerful enemy had intruded into the Academy’s compound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A couple of figures ascended into the sky from above Shrek Academy. The one who was leading them was none other than Yan Shaozhe, the Dean of the Martial Soul Department within Shrek Academy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was accompanied by Xian Lin’er, Qian Duoduo, Cai Mei’er, and Zhang Lexuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw the Beast God floating in mid-air, a worried look appeared on all their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not an entity they could afford to offend! Previously, Elder Xuan and Elder Mu were only able to seal him for a short period of time after linking their powers. He only left after being persuaded by Huo Yuhao. If not, Shrek City could have been in serious danger back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beast God, it has been a while since we last met. How have you been doing? May I know why you have visited Shrek Academy?” Yan Shaozhe used his hands to make a splitting motion as white intense flames appeared before transforming into two gigantic wings, which tore apart the pressure that was pervading the air. Following which, he brought the group of people with him up into the air until they reached the same altitude as Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief as he exclaimed, “Yan Shaozhe, you have improved very quickly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Dean of the Martial Soul Department’s cultivation was already close to Elder Xuan’s before he had become an Ultimate Douluo. Even though he had not officially reached Rank 98, he was on the brink of doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian had not expected a Transcendent Douluo to improve his cultivation so rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s own martial soul was a top-tier martial soul. Coupled with the assistance of the Qiankun Fortune Pills, Yan Shaozhe was able to improve his cultivation very rapidly. In a few months’ time, he would be able to reach Rank 98. As for whether he could eventually reach Rank 99, it would depend on his luck and his ability to understand and draw insights from the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, his current ability had already surpassed Elder Song. He had become the number one soul master within Shrek Academy other than Elder Xuan. Even though Elder Xuan had already cultivated at Rank 98 for an extended period of time, he was ultimately an agility-type soul master. There would still be a gap between him and Yan Shaozhe when it came to the power of their martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am embarrassed by your lavish praises, Beast God. Compared to you, I am really nothing. There must be a reason for you to grace our Academy in such a domineering manner. Unless you are here to help us defend against our enemies?” As he spoke, Yan Shaozhe pointed outside of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was actually stumped by his proposition. He could not help but turn his head to take a look at what was happening outside the city. Even though the Sun Moon Empire’s army was more than fifty kilometers away, Di Tian was naturally able to see them clearly with the eyesight that he had. His pupils rapidly contracted as he sensed danger from among the troops. This meant that someone in the camp possessed a power which could threaten him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am not here to help you. All of you will have to resolve your human problems by yourselves. I am here to look for Huo Yuhao. Let him out. I have questions for him” Di Tian answered coldly. He would not be duped that easily. In fact, he did not have a favorable impression of any human.</span></p>
