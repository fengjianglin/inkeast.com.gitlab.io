 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To be more direct, the Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern is a treasure ground for ice-type cultivators like us. Why was Di Tian able to overcome eight consecutive bottlenecks and become the god of all beasts, and even invincible? This is because he managed to gain control of a treasure ground: the Lake of Life in the Core Region of the Great Star Dou Forest. He used the immense life energy there to nourish himself, allowing him to achieve what he has today. However, the truth is that the Lake of Life can nourish any soul beast. He’s not the only one who can benefit from it. This is because the Lake of Life is life-type.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In fact, it isn’t completely compatible with his darkness-type. Even so, he was still able to cultivate to such a level. But the Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern is completely compatible with us! It is as valuable as the Lake of Life to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing her words, Huo Yuhao was instantly astonished. He had personally seen the Lake of Life before! At the core of the Lake of Life was Life Gold. In addition, it wasn’t lacking in amount. It was the place that held the lifeline of the entire Great Star Dou Forest. If the Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern could compare to the Lake of Life like what the Ice Empress had said, it would be completely unbelievable...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ice Empress, is there no Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern at the core of the Extreme North?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress was in a bit of daze. She seemed to still be struck with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another voice sounded at this moment. “Yes, there’s at least another one.” As a light projection flashed, the Skydream Iceworm appeared beside the Ice Empress. He was also emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was puzzled as he looked at the Skydream Iceworm. The Ice Empress also glanced at him in the same way, but there was an extra weird look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm asked, “Yuhao, did you forget how I managed to survive for so long?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body shook. “You mentioned that you spent most of your time sleeping, and a million years passed just like that. I remember that you consumed some kind of ice essence and fell into a deep sleep. Don’t tell me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Skydream nodded. “That’s right. The Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence that I consumed came from the Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern! I discovered that place unintentionally. The essence of an ice cavern lies in the ice essence. I was just an iceworm, but I relied on the benefits of the ice essence to cultivate into a million-year soul beast. Ice also wanted to kill me because of this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph.” The Ice Empress snorted, “If you had let me have the ice essence then, the Beast God might not be Di Tian. The Snow Empress would also…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm leisurely replied, “Ice, stop whining. This is called fate and destiny.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you looking for a beating?” The Ice Empress snorted furiously, and the Skydream Iceworm immediately stopped making any sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress turned to Huo Yuhao and said, “I didn’t expect there to be a second Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern in this world. Your luck is simply too good. Furthermore, this ice cavern is different from the one that Skydream encountered the other time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted. From the Ice Empress’ agitated look, and how the Skydream Iceworm described the situation, he must have had gotten extremely lucky. No matter what the difference was, it should be extremely beneficial to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress said, “The ice cavern that Skydream was in had a huge amount of Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence. That thing is very nourishing for ice-type soul beasts like us. It’s a real treasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s of the same tier as your Life Gold. However, we didn’t see any Divine Ice Crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern is in fact formed when Mysterious Ice is converted into it under huge pressure after being hidden for more than ten thousand years. Hundreds of thousands of years, and even upwards of a million years might be needed for it to be formed. The right opportunities are also required.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This ice cavern is filled with so many Divine Ice Crystals. As for how much Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence can be produced, it’s difficult to tell. However, there’s bound to be some. I had a look over there earlier, and there isn’t any here. If it’s not here, it should be in the well. It feels like this ice cavern isn’t much smaller than the ice cavern that Skydream saw, even though it’s smaller. If there’s some ice essence here, it would be very useful for the four of us and you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress revealed yet another heavy look in her eyes when she said that. She really wished that she had encountered this ice cavern before she had given up her body! If that were the case, everything would have been different...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm said, “Alright, Ice. Don’t think too much. Honestly speaking, one must be very fortunate to bump into a Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern. I’m not afraid that you’ll dislike my words, but both you and the Snow Empress don’t have such fortune. You are only here because of Yuhao. If you didn’t choose to fuse with Yuhao before, you wouldn’t have been able to experience something as good in your entire life. This is why you shouldn’t look for problems for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What surprised Huo Yuhao was that the Ice Empress wasn’t furious after hearing the Skydream Iceworm’s words. Instead, she nodded and mocked herself, “Yes! I am indeed finding problems for myself. Let’s not talk about this. Yuhao, you must not give up such a rare opportunity. We must tap the resources here effectively.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Ice Empress, what is this Divine Ice Crystal? What’s its use for us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress replied, “Divine Ice Crystals might not be as valuable as Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, but they’re still extremely valuable. They are the strongest and toughest ice-type metal. They appear as crystals, but they possess the properties of metals. To put it in human words, a Divine Ice Crystal is a top-grade rare metal. As for how their special characteristics are used, it will depend on the user.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted, and said, “It seems like Elder Nan Shuishui was right. The Divine Ice Crystals here are very suitable for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he lifted his right hand. His Darkgolden Terrorclaws revealed sharp, dark-golden blades as he swept it towards the Divine Ice Crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Piercing sounds resonated, and five streaks of sparks flashed. However, only shallow marks were left on the ice crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an extremely tough metal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was pertinent to note that Huo Yuhao would often use his terrorclaws to sculpt his soul tools when he manufactured them. The sharpness and strength of his terrorclaws were great, and were one of his best offensive weapons. However, they weren’t enough to damage the ice crystals. This showed how tough they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was confused as he looked at the Ice Empress. “The Divine Ice Crystal is so tough. How can we mine it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress smiled and said, “There are many items that clash with one another, but there’s always something that can overcome another thing. Don’t worry, others might find it difficult to find a way, but it won’t be difficult for us to leave with these crystals. You can’t use your Life Guardian Blade. It’ll destroy the internal structure of the ice crystals. This Divine Ice Crystal is in itself one of the best ice-type soul conductors and amplifiers. Try pouring your soul power into it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao agreed to her words and retracted his terrorclaws. He put his right hand on the ice crystals beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was stunned that this ice crystal didn’t feel cold even though the cavern was at such a low temperature. It was as if all its cold was contained inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly poured in his Ultimate Ice soul power. After this, his body shook, and he revealed a shocked look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could clearly sense an affinity when he poured his soul power into the ice crystal. Yes, it was an affinity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clearly a metal, but it seemed to have emotions. It felt very close to his soul power. After this, Huo Yuhao felt the ice crystal in his hand softening a little. He tightened his five fingers and exerted strength as he pulled, and a huge piece of ice crystal was pulled out, just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once this piece of ice was separated from the cavern and landed in his hand, his body immediately emitted a deep-blue glow. Lights subtly flashed. It was as if the piece of ice crystal had a life of its own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You sense it, don’t you?” The Ice Empress asked. “The reason why it’s called the Divine Ice Crystal is because it has evolved into a realm with some life of its own. Animals and plants have their own lives. For minerals and metals, they can exude their own life aura and emotions when they reach a certain quality. It’s just that it’s much more difficult for them compared to animals and plants.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What you are sensing is correct, i’s all real. If you want to dig out some ice crystals, there’s only one way... your Ultimate Ice soul power. You, me, and the Snow Empress can do it. Skydream can’t do it, and Star Anise is slightly lacking, too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “I’m using your power, anyway. Why do I feel that it’s no longer hard, but soft, yet resilient? It’s like…” After speaking to this point, he paused for a moment and thought of a way to describe it before saying, “It’s like it’s a huge piece of crystal jelly. It’s too magical.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress nodded and replied, “You must try to communicate with the life aura inside with your Ultimate Ice soul power. Such a life aura is also called an ice spirit in the Extreme North. You can only try to retrieve it for now. It’s only when you can fully communicate with it that you can completely own it. Don’t think that just because there’s a lot of ice crystals here, you can retrieve as many ice spirits as you want. Not many of them can nurture ice spirits. The remaining ice crystals can be dug out, but they don’t have ice spirits. You are in luck, this piece of ice crystal contains a life spirit!”</span></p>
