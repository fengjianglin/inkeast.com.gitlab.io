 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 92.3: The Decisive 3v3 Battle!</strong></p>
 <p>Although Bei Bei’s reactions were a bit slow, he still had the throwing knife to help him block the attack. Combined with Huo Yuhao’s warning, he still had enough time to change the direction he was moving in and keep from being burned by that light flare. But even though this was the case, he still felt as though a raging storm of metal was trying to swallow him up.</p>
 <p>Just what was this soul skill? Bei Bei was stunned. This Ye Wuqing seemed to have a very special martial soul. Even for a student of Shrek Academy like him, this was the first time he’d seen a martial soul like this.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing was slightly stunned at seeing his Golden Leaf get intercepted. However, the second leaf quickly appeared in his hands. With a flash of golden light, it flew out as his first soul skill again. Furthermore, the Golden Leaf had an extremely swaying trajectory this time; he had flung it straight into the air.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the strength of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection manifested itself. Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei simply didn’t need to care about the Golden Leaf as they continued forward. Bei Bei suddenly accelerated, closing the distance between the two parties to thirty meters. On the other hand, Huo Yuhao released a timely Spiritual Interference.</p>
 <p>Since Shangguan Can’s Soulsucking Bell could interfere with them, they could naturally do the same to their opponents as well.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing’s trio were slightly stunned by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Interference; Yan’er even thought that Shangguan Can had mistakenly aimed his Soulsucking Bell towards them, and subconsciously looked towards him.</p>
 <p>The Golden Leaf suddenly fell towards Bei Bei, but a throwing knife appeared in a timely manner to block its path. Ye Wuqing’s Golden Leaf was certainly very powerful, but what good would it do if it was unable to strike its target?</p>
 <p>If the first time was a coincidence, the second time clearly couldn’t be explained as something as simple as a coincidence.</p>
 <p>Justsky Academy’s trio consisted of one auxiliary soul master and two long-ranged ones, and so, distance was naturally a relatively important resource for Bei Bei, Huo Yuhao, and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao also sped up, but he didn’t do this by relying on the burst of energy provided by his soul power. Instead, the soul thrusters on his back and feet suddenly lit up. This was the first time he was using a soul tool in this tournament.</p>
 <p>He wore speed-varying soul thrusters below his feet, and a Class 2 soul thruster on his back, allowing him to suddenly accelerate. Instantly, he crossed the thirty meter distance between the two parties. With Wang Dong’s soul power supporting him, he would be able to control even a Class 3 soul tool, let alone a Class 2 one. The only thing worth pointing out was that, when he activated the thrusters on his back, Wang Dong started holding onto his shoulders instead of his waist. This allowed him to fly horizontally through the air while keeping parallel with the ground. This prevented him from suffering any knockback effects from the soul thrusters, while allowing him to not affect Huo Yuhao’s advance.</p>
 <p>Justsky Academy was extremely cautious towards Huo Yuhao. After all, he had performed astonishingly well during the previous matches, and a mysterious person was the most terrifying thing in the world. Up till now, nobody had clearly guessed what Huo Yuhao’s actual strength was.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s target was Shangguan Can, and at this moment, he was just about to reach him.</p>
 <p>The sound coming from Shangguan Can’s Soulsucking Bell suddenly became sharp as he activated his third soul skill. That piercing toll of the bell made it seem as though there were countless needles that were irritating one’s eardrums. It wasn’t just unpleasant to hear, but it even gave off an indescribable sense of jitteriness.</p>
 <p>Soulpiercing! This was Shangguan Can’s third soul skill. If one’s cultivation was far weaker than his, one would feel extremely irritated due to this soul skill. There was even a chance that one would directly fall into a coma. Furthermore, this soul skill covered an extremely large area.</p>
 <p>The charging Bei Bei was directly affected, and Wang Dong likewise; only Huo Yuhao acted as if he hadn’t heard anything at all. Before he reached Shangguan can, a somewhat twisted ray of white light had already shot towards the latter like lightning.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing and Yan’er would naturally not just stand idly by while Shangguan Can was being attacked. The aura around Yan’er suddenly changed, and the large fireball she was standing on shot out. The large fireball split into five smaller ones in midair, and two of them shot towards Huo Yuhao, while the other three blocked Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>Not only that, but she put her palms together in front of her chest, and her third soul ring lit up, causing an enormous purple fireball to congeal in front of her. Instantly, the air within the tournament stage started to heat up as a result of this purple flame.</p>
 <p>A Golden Leaf accurately blocked Huo Yuhao’s light ray, just like how he had done the same using his throwing knives earlier. Ye Wuqing had made a move; he naturally would not allow his auxiliary-type soul master to be struck just like that.</p>
 <p>However, a mysterious scene occurred the instant that Golden Leaf sliced through the soul light’s beam of light.</p>
 <p>The Golden Leaf passed straight through it, as though it had not encountered any resistance at all.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing was originally planning to use his Golden Leaf to block Huo Yuhao’s attack, causing it to explode and generate an explosive force from the metallic storm it would create. He was confident in stopping Huo Yuhao’s next move before using an even stronger soul skill on him and Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>However, he had made a mistake.</p>
 <p>Once the seemingly extremely powerful Golden Leaf touched the ray of light, it unexpectedly passed straight through it, as though it had collided with nothing at all. At this moment, it was flying straight towards Shangguan Can.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Can was very, very familiar with the strength of Ye Wuqing’s Golden Leaf! After letting out a cry, he couldn’t be bothered with the continued activation of his Soulsucking Bell as he fiercely leapt to the side like a fish.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, that ray of light suddenly curved in midair, then accurately struck Ye Wuqing.</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing only felt his entire body go numb as he fell into a state of paralysis.</p>
 <p>Right, Huo Yuhao had used the soul paralysis ray he had bought at the soul tool auction.</p>
 <p>The soul paralysis ray naturally wouldn’t curve around in midair, and it would definitely have caused Ye Wuqing’s Golden Leaf to explode if it had truly collided with it. However, why did the Golden Leaf just brush past it? Furthermore, why did it force Shangguan Can into such a miserable state?</p>
 <p>This was the effect of Huo Yuhao simultaneously using his two powerful soul skills. He had done this by using his Spiritual Detection to accurately determine the movements of his opponents, and his Imitation to create a deviation in what had actually happened and what his opponents saw.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao clearly knew of the difficulties involved in this match. Due to this pressure, his potential was fully unleashed, not just in strength, but also in his wisdom. The most ingenious part of his attack was right here. His Imitation allowed him to make minute transformations to the things around him, and the more minute these transformations were, the harder it would be to tell that they were fake. The entire process of charging towards Shangguan Can was real; the only thing that was fake was the soul paralysis ray. The reason why it had curved was because it had left the range of his Imitation. No matter how strong Ye Wuqing was, he would definitely be unable to dodge a strange move like this!</p>
 <p>Ye Wuqing had been paralysed, while Shangguan Can had been forced into retreating in a sorry state. At this moment, Bei Bei, Huo Yuhao, and Wang Dong only had to face a single person--Yan’er.</p>
 <p>She had launched five large fireballs, but Bei Bei had no plans of allowing the two fireballs directed toward Huo Yuhao from striking their target.</p>
 <p>Countless lightning snakes shot out simultaneously, then transformed into countless arrows of lightning that explosively blasted everything.</p>
 <p>This was Bei Bei’s second soul skill, Vigorous Thunderbolt.</p>
 <p>The tyrannical net of lightning collided with the five fireballs, filling the sky with sparks. The terrifying impact coming from that collision was so great that even the paralysed Ye Wuqing was forced to stagger a few steps backwards.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the most powerful use of Wang Dong’s wings was revealed. As he flapped his wings, Huo Yuhao changed directions, allowing him to not only dodge the aftereffects of the Golden Leaf’s explosion, but also allowing him to soar into the air. He flew past Bei Bei’s head, bringing Huo Yuhao straight towards Yan’er.</p>
 <p>Right. From the very start, Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei’s target wasn’t Ye Wuqing or Shangguan Can.</p>
 <p>As an auxiliary-type soul master, although Shangguan Can wasn’t weak, he couldn’t provide too much assistance to his teammates due to Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes. Moreover, Ye Wuqing was strong to the point where even if Huo Yuhao’s trio were to take him on 1v3, they might not be able to defeat him directly.</p>
 <p>Because of that, their target from the very start was Yan’er. Only, they had concealed all of this in an extremely ingenious manner during their previous collision. At this moment, they suddenly exploded out.</p>
 <p>Yan’er’s only strength was the enormous purple fireball that she had formed in front of her. The high temperatures coming from it scorched the air, causing ripple-like distortions to appear in the air surrounding her body.</p>
 <p>At the same time, she was completely deserving of being a student chosen for Justsky Academy’s official team. Even when facing a disadvantageous situation like this, she didn’t seem flustered at all. She quickly retreated, preventing the distance between her and Ye Wuqing from increasing as she did so. At the same time, she didn’t use the purple fireball created from her thousand year soul skill. Instead, she kept it in front of her, ready to block attacks from her opponents at any time.</p>
 <p>There was no doubt that she was making the right choice. The only thing she had to do right now was persevere and not fall under the all-out attacks of the three opponents in front of her until Ye Wuqing recovered from his paralysed state.</p>
 <p>However, she quickly discovered that she had still made a miscalculation.</p>
 <p>The originally-scorching temperatures on the tournament stage suddenly dropped, as though a cold stream had poured into it. The size of purple fireball in front of Yan’er’s body was instantly reduced by a third, and she was simply unable to release the power of its heat.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s eyes had become completely jade-green. Although he still had two soul rings in front of him due to his Imitation, he had actually switched his martial soul to the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.</p>
 <p>This was a martial soul that possessed Ultimate Ice, a martial soul that could cause Shrek Academy’s Sea God’s Pavilion to hold a meeting! Even the great powers within Shrek Academy were overjoyed beyond belief when discovering the existence of Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. From that, the power of his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion could be seen.</p>
 <p>His soul power wasn’t up to par, but his martial soul and soul rings were unrivaled existences.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s gaze turned serious, and the soul thruster on his back flickered with light as he shot towards Yan’er like a bolt of lightning. Unexpectedly, he used his hands to directly swat at Yan’er’s purple fireball.</p>
