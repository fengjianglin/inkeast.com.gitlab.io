However, oddly, it wasn’t raining at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao continued to repeat his actions like a machine, despite his body being on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he’d suffered less from the martial soul fusion skill, he’d still almost entirely exhausted his soul power when he used everything he had at the end. Furthermore, he’d treated Wang Qiu’er and used his blood as medicine for her; his body was truly about to burn out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he felt that Wang Qiu’er’s life power had finally stopped depleting, and was beginning to recover, he finally relaxed. As soon as he did so, an intense wave of fatigue and weakness engulfed his body. Even though this was the Great Star Dou Forest, Huo Yuhao couldn’t be bothered to care anymore. After holding on for so long, he finally collapsed. He was still holding his White Tiger Dagger tightly, his other wrist marred with countless cuts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he passed out, they both maintained weird postures. Huo Yuhao lay flat on the ground, while Wang Qiu’er laid in the tent. However, her head was still resting on his legs, her mouth still stained with some of Huo Yuhao’s blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them fell into a deep sleep just like that. Perhaps they were blessed, but no soul beasts attacked them in their weakened states. Not far from them, the soul rings released from the wolf-apes’ corpses slowly started to dissipate as time passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An hour later…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should’ve come from this direction. I’m very sensitive to sounds. I’m sure I’m right.” Li Yongyue said confidently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They quickly made their way through the forest. Li Yongyue led the team and waved his Moonblade continuously, carving a path forward for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan was right behind Li Yongyue. Behind her were Han Ruoruo, Wang Dong’er, Mo Xuan, and the pale-faced Dean Cai Mei’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Huo Yuhao had expected, they’d fought with the male Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. In order to protect everyone, Cai Mei’er hadn’t dared to overuse her powers. Right when they’d been about to end the fight, Zhong Litian and Zhong Liren had suddenly intervened. As such, Cai Mei’er had retracted her powers just before they killed the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another epic fight had ensued! Cai Mei’er had demonstrated great abilities, resulting in Zhong Litian and Zhong Lidi being unable to gain the upper hand as they were resisted by everyone from Shrek Academy. After all, some of their energy had been depleted earlier from using their beast spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when Zhong Liren appeared, even Cai Mei’er’s heart sank. She knew that it would be very difficult to completely retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhong Liren said something to Zhong Litian that changed his expression. The three brothers attacked them for awhile, then fled. Their crisis had been averted in this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They roughly knew what Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er had gone to do; Zhong Liren’s expression had changed when he returned. Evidently, it had something to do with the both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er alone was fine. After all, she was a new student of the academy. However, Huo Yuhao was different! He wasn’t just a part of the inner courtyard. He was also part of the Sea God’s Pavilion! If something happened to him, Cai Mei’er couldn’t imagine what kind of problems it would cause when they returned to the academy. Huo Yuhao was the Heir to the Sea God’s Pavilion! He was definitely the future hope of the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, none of them dared to delay any further. They immediately started looking for Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er, but weren’t able to find them. Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er were completely missing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They couldn’t even be bothered to rest. Cai Mei’er also joined the team and used her fastest speed to search for the two of them. They also left markings behind just in case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right as they’d been about to rest for the night, a loud sound had surprised all of them from afar. The tremendous explosion had sounded extremely clear, even though it came from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was extremely anxious; Huo Yuhao’s disappearance made her feel as if her heart had left with him. After hearing the explosion, she couldn’t help but rush towards it. Zhang Lexuan wanted to stop her, but Wang Dong nearly attacked her in retaliation. Left with no other option, Cai Mei’er could only try and trace the source of the explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s expression was extremely pale at this point. Her big turquoise eyes were filled with anxiety, and she could even be seen tearing up from time to time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She only sensed how strong her enemies were after fighting the evil soul masters. After Huo Yuhao left, she’d heard a few booms, but didn’t know other news about him. Even though she was confident in him, she knew that he couldn’t defeat an eight-ringed evil soul master with his current cultivation! How could she not be anxious?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wang Dong’er confidently told everyone that Huo Yuhao wasn’t in any danger. Due to their martial fusion soul skill, the two of them were already slightly connected. If something had really happened to Huo Yuhao, she’d definitely feel it. Even though she’d had a few scares along the way, the situation that she’d feared most hadn’t occured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her senses had naturally been aroused by the reverberating booms because Huo Yuhao had once fired cannon shells using the Lightning God’s Fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They searched for close to two hours, but the geography of the forest was simply too complex, thus they had to walk around some small canyons. They only got close to their target because of Li Yongyue’s memory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuhao, is it you?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er thought in her heart, her tears starting to flow. She’d gone through a tough fight, and had been searching for him for an entire day. Furthermore, the sky was already completely dark now. Her feminine fragility left her unable to withstand any further disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuhao, nothing must happen to you!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After passing through a patch of forest, Li Yongyue was surprised and shouted, “There’s a tent there!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he could continue, a streak of golden light had already rushed forward from behind him. Wang Dong’er barrelled past him as she beat her Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings and flew in the direction of the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden light looked extremely bright in the pitch-dark night. Wang Dong’er burst forward with all her strength; at this point, she felt as if she’d expended all of her energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tent, it’s a tent. It’s his tent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was able to immediately recognize Huo Yuhao’s tent. Since he could use his tent, that meant that he should fine. The surprise jolted her fatigued body. She flapped her wings with renewed vigor and reached above the tent within a few seconds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao!” Wang Dong’er shouted anxiously. She couldn’t be bothered with the fact that this was the Great Star Dou Forest that was filled with soul beasts at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she stopped shouting after an instant. Since the golden-blue light from her wings was illuminating her surroundings, everything below her was visible for her to see. She saw him lying on the ground with a pale expression on his face, as well as Wang Qiu’er lying on his lap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They’re together?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;This was the first thought that flashed through Wang Dong’er’s mind. However, she was instantly jolted from her daze. She retracted her wings and quickly descended, then came up to Huo Yuhao and pressed her hand to his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er felt dizzy when she felt his heart beating, and became less tense. She was panting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s alright, he’s alright. He’s still alive!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tears started to flow down her face uncontrollably and she started to bawl as she leapt onto his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her cries scared everyone who arrived after her. Cai Mei’er was naturally the most anxious. When she arrived beside Wang Qiu’er, it was almost as if she’d used an Instant Shift. She grabbed Huo Yuhao’s hand and read his pulse. When she confirmed its presence, she heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>

You almost scared me to death.” She was extremely relieved now that they’d found Huo Yuhao. Everything would be much easier so long as Huo Yuhao was alive.</span></p>

She didn’t crowd around Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er, but rather instructed everyone else to spread out to guard the tent against any potential soul beasts.</span></p>

They’d never seen such soul beasts before. When they looked at Wang Qiu’er’s bloodstained clothing again, their expressions turned even weirder. Wang Qiu’er was in the tent, but her clothing was outside. What exactly was going on?</span></p>

Once she’d calmed down, she hurriedly stood up and let Cai Mei’er treat Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

Wang Qiu’er continued to look better and better as she laid on Huo Yuhao’s legs; her face expression was very calm.</span></p>

Why did Huo Yuhao choose to fight with her instead of me? Why didn’t he bring me along?</span></p>
