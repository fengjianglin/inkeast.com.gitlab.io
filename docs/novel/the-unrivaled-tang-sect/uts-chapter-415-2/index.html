The combination of Huo Yuhao’s swords instantly turned into countless streaks of lights before vanishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Tai Tan’s upper body shook slightly after he resisted Huo Yuhao’s swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a Transcendent Douluo! After resisting Huo Yuhao’s attack, his body was actually shaking. Furthermore, he revealed a lost look in his eyes again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unforgettable... this was the power of Remembrance. The Fist of Remembrance and Sword of Longing forced Tai Tan to feel the crazy sense of remembrance in Huo Yuhao’s heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t stop; his body followed his heart. There was only a gentle look in his eyes. As he lifted his right hand, his palm turned transparent gold. The Snow Lady behind him was like his shadow as she moved along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao was three meters away from Tai Tan, the Snow Lady flowed into Huo Yuhao from behind before drifting forward in front of him. She beat Huo Yuhao to Tai Tan and imprinted her snowy-white palm on his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was her Unparalleled Chill, Empress’ Sword.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan’s momentary trance lasted for only a second before his eyes revealed a furious glare once again. His sixth soul ring suddenly turned from black to gold, and his Giant Ape form was instantly covered by a layer of golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indestructible Vajra! It was a defensive-type soul skill stronger than an Invincible Barrier, a powerful ability that was fused with his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady imprinted her right palm on Tai Tan’s body but didn’t make any sound. After this, she drifted backward and fused with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While this palm seemed very light and gentle, it was the Snow Empress’ strongest attack! The layer of golden light covering Tai Tan’s body instantly turned white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Snow Empress unleashed her full strength, Tai Tan would never dare to resist this palm. It was a pity that the Snow Empress was still a Snow Lady right now. She was still in her young state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao followed by imprinting his Haodong Palm in the same place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao only felt as if he had crashed into a towering mountain. Instantly, his right arm let out a series of cracking sounds. If not for the fact that he had become very strong, and his tolerance was extremely great under the nourishment of his life energy, his arm would have fractured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt a stiff feeling in his chest and spat out blood. He was also immediately flung backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The defensive strength of the Giant Ape was too great under the effect of Tai Tan’s Indestructible Vajra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White turned back to gold. Tai Tan stood in place without moving. When he unleashed his Indestructible Vajra in his Martial Soul True Body, even a Titled Douluo wasn’t able to hurt him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his body still locked up because of the extreme chill he was subjected to. Although the strength of the Snow Lady’s Unparalleled Chill wasn’t able to surge towards his heart, it was still the Snow Empress’ strongest attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the Haodong Palm still followed after her Unparalleled Chill. Given the strength of the Haodong Palm, Tai Tan’s Indestructible Vajra couldn’t be overcome. However, this palm was still filled with Huo Yuhao’s spiritual intent! Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was much stronger than Tai Tan's spiritual power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan only felt an indescribable wave of spiritual power surging into his brain and spirit. That strong sense of remembrance was filled with sorrowful memories; it was tear-inducing! Tai Tan’s eyes turned red, and two streams of tears flowed down his cheeks. His emotions were immersed in this sense of remembrance, and he stood there in a daze. Although he had still unleashed his Indestructible Vajra, he didn’t chase Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was flung away, but he didn’t stop fighting. He wasn’t the old Huo Yuhao, who would immediately lose his fighting strength after unleashing his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills. He was now the Eye of the Asura, with three Spirits, twin martial souls, and the cultivation of a Soul Sage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he flew back, his soul rings flashed. One red, four orange-gold, and two more red soul rings appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s seven soul rings were undoubtedly more dazzling than the seven soul rings of Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes. Huo Yuhao’s terrifying spiritual power instantly reached an extreme. He shut his eyes, but his Eye of Destiny opened once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without unleashing his Spirit Eyes, his Eye of Destiny still managed to unleash his Spiritual Shock, which struck Tai Tan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan’s defense against spiritual attacks weakened significantly while he was stuck in his current state of remembrance and after he was struck by the two soul skills of Huo Yuhao’s Eye of the Asura. Fortunately, his Indestructible Vajra could still defend against spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He staggered backward. After his spirit was shocked, he wasn’t able to maintain his Martial Soul True Body and Indestructible Vajra anymore. He suffered from a splitting headache and quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huo Yuhao changed. His seventh soul ring shone brightly, and a huge projection of an Ice Jade Scorpion appeared behind him. Huo Yuhao immediately fused with this light projection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This light projection instantly became solid, but the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion didn’t appear. Instead, there was a lady in a long, jade-green dress. She looked very cold, arrogant, and elegant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the Ice Empress’ Martial Soul True Body, the Ice Empress’ Descent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Martial Soul True Body was unique. The reason was very simple: Huo Yuhao’s second martial soul was alive! A living Martial Soul True Body had to be unique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without his fusion with the Skydream Iceworm, he wouldn’t have had his second martial soul, which was an Ultimate Ice martial soul. He also wouldn’t have been able to fuse with the Ice Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was only possible with the cooperation of a million-year soul beast and a four-hundred-thousand year soul beast! How could it possibly be replicated?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress’ Descent could enable the temporary appearance of the Ice Empress in this Martial Soul True Body state. At the same time, the Ice Empress’ original fighting strength could also be unleashed. As for how long the Ice Empress could appear to fight, that was directly related to Huo Yuhao’s cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress looked at Tai Tan coldly. She could already sense how strong he was. As she lifted her right hand, her palm, which was covered with diamond ice crystals, shook slightly, and another projection appeared beside her. It was the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady grabbed onto the Ice Empress’ right hand with her left hand before something strange occurred. The Snow Lady grew at a shocking speed, and her snow-white dress swayed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her gaze also became deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Ice Empress and the Snow Empress looked at each other, their bodies started to glow with different-colored lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t the end. A strange stalk of grass silently appeared behind their backs. All its leaves turned illusory and only left two diamond-shaped ice crystals behind. These two crystals drifted up and landed on the both of the Snow Empress and Ice Empress’ foreheads, making them seem even more regal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light that rose from these two empresses seemed to turn solid, and surged forward. The white and jade-green light from their bodies released auras of extremely low temperature. At this moment, the temperature around these two empresses dropped to almost absolute zero. Liquid oxygen was falling around them like misting rain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A rose-gold vertical eye rose behind them at this moment. Behind this vertical eye, projections of ten golden rings surfaced and flashed subtly.</span></p>

It was Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock again. Even though the vertical eye immediately dissipated and disappeared after this Spiritual Shock was unleashed, this attack still managed to strike Tai Tan.</span></p>

His nostrils were already flowing with fresh blood. After his defense against spiritual power was affected by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Reaving, his resistance had reached a low point.</span></p>

He had underestimated Huo Yuhao from the start. He had just wanted to see how Huo Yuhao would perform after months of not seeing him. But Huo Yuhao gave him a huge surprise!</span></p>

Following this, a green projection descended from the sky and turned into a barrier that engulfed Tai Tan.</span></p>

However, the nine green dragons still continued to revolve around it. Furthermore, the strength of the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses became weaker with every revolution.</span></p>

A figure was standing beside him and grabbing his shoulder. He was flung back towards the gate of Clear Sky Castle, which was now standing open.</span></p>

He had lost consciousness.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao didn’t have a contingency plan after unleashing this series of ultimate attacks. In fact, he was unable to fight further due to the emotional changes that he experienced after he unleashed the Haodong Palm. The attacks that followed were all completed by his three Spirits and the Ice Empress. Huo Yuhao had proved how good and terrifying it was to have Spirits!</span></p>
