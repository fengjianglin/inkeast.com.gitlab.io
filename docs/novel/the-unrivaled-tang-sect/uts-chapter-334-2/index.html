He immediately felt as if a mountain were pressing down on his soul. He couldn’t even control his own body to stand up. He was pressed firmly to the ground after he collapsed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the fifth soul skill of the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron, the Threelives Soulcrush!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a strong soul skill that suppressed a soul. Huo Yuhao had once let Xiao Xiao use this soul skill against him. Even with his immense spiritual power, it took him three minutes to overcome the suppression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was important to know that his spiritual power was comparable to a Soul Douluo. His control might even be better!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron was very rare among tool souls, but it was a top-ranked martial soul that wasn’t inferior to the Clear Sky Hammer. The greatest characteristic of this martial soul was that it became stronger as the number of soul rings and the soul master’s abilities increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Xiao Xiao gained this soul skill, Elder Xuan told her that she could protect herself against any evil soul master as long as he wasn’t a Soul Sage yet. It showed how strong this soul skill was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it wasn’t without flaws. Once it was initiated, Xiao Xiao couldn’t move anymore. She could only control her soul skill with all her strength. Unless she ended it of her own accord or her soul power was depleted, her Threelives Soulcrush would remain active.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her soul skill might be destroyed if she suffered external attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, she had to ensure that she wasn’t externally susceptible once she used this soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao even thought of suppressing all three evil soul masters at the same time, but this proposition was denied by Huo Yuhao. The more people she suppressed, the greater the depletion of her soul power. She didn’t need to do so considering the situation they were in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the Threelives Soulcrush was initiated, anyone who tried to save or attack the person being suppressed would suffer from a backlash against his soul power due to the connection between his soul and body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a simple reason why Xiao Xiao was allowed to use the Threelives Soulcrush – she was supposed to restrain a six-ringed evil soul master with her five-ringed cultivation! This allowed her own team to concentrate more of their strength to deal with the other two evil soul masters. Once they got rid of the two others, it wouldn’t be difficult to get rid of the Skeleton King anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Xiao Xiao’s Threelives Soulcrush didn’t have any effect on soul tools. In other words, He Caitou was the only one who wouldn’t suffer any backlash from the Threelives Soulcrush if he attacked the Skeleton King right now. Even if the Eye of Fear wasn’t suitable to be used against Lu Genggeng and Yan Feng, the Skeleton King was still a target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was called strategizing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the circumstance that his team didn’t have an absolute advantage and might even be at a slight disadvantage, Huo Yuhao tapped into the analysis he obtained through his Spiritual Detection and deep understanding of his teammates’ abilities to create such a situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yan Feng had already woken up just as the Skeleton King was being suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed to be able to tell the effects and flaws of the Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron immediately. He flapped his right wing forcefully, and a streak of icy-blue light shot towards Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were two against six right now. It was getting increasingly disadvantageous for the Holy Ghost team. While Yan Feng was a very composed person, he couldn’t help but become anxious at this point. No matter how confident he was, he didn’t think that he could defeat the entire Tang Sect team by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his judgment was very accurate. Among the Tang Sect, those who could pose a threat to him included Xu Sanshi, He Caitou, Huo Yuhao, and Wang Dong’er. Among the four of them, Xu Sanshi’s old injury had relapsed even though he had managed to achieve his goal, and his abilities had fallen. As for the other three, he felt that the greatest threat wasn’t He Caitou even though he had two Class 7 soul tools with him now. Rather, it was Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a feeling that came from his soul. When the two streaks of icy, fog-like light were dissipated earlier, Yan Feng had already sensed that there was danger. This danger had come from Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ultimate Ice. Even my power of evil ice can’t invade his Ultimate Ice? This is how strong an Ultimate element is! If I devour his abilities, can I increase my power of evil ice to an Ultimate level? When that happens, I’ll become the Holy Son of the Church, and I might even become the next founder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of this, Yan Feng’s eyes revealed a look of greed. Although his attack was targeted at Xiao Xiao, his attention was all on Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of icy azure light surged out from Huo Yuhao’s chest and intercepted the power of evil ice that Yan Feng unleashed. Its success proved that Yan Feng’s power of evil ice was inferior to his Ultimate Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er had also recovered from their earlier displacement. Wang Dong’er lifted her hands, and a Hexagram Array appeared in front of Lu Genggeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Genggeng had woken up just after Yan Feng. He didn’t move a single inch, waiting for his chance to attack. It was a pity that the changes to his spiritual self couldn’t be concealed from Huo Yuhao. Wang Dong’er’s Hexagram Array immediately stopped him from advancing any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, a thin streak of dark red light the width of an index finger also shot out from afar. The target of this streak of light was Lu Genggeng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou’s fully-charged piercing cannon had been fired!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was a hundred meters away, Lu Genggeng shuddered when the cannon was fired. While he was fat, he wasn’t slow at all. He pointed his left foot toward the ground and made a hundred and eighty degree turn on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looked like… an old sow was dancing ballet. It was too amusing, but it was effective!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately turned to face He Caitou. Of Lu Genggeng’s six soul rings, his third purple soul ring shone. Suddenly, he grew even larger in size. He was like a mountain of meat right now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was too huge. Although Lu Genggeng was also quick, he couldn’t avoid the red light. As it flashed, a hole appeared in his body with a meaty sound, like a spear being driven into a hanging carcass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the dark red light seemed very thin, it penetrated his two-meter thick body and exited from his back. The entry and exit wounds were charred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Genggeng screamed in pain, and his eyes turned blood-red. He shook his fat and the charred wound disappeared. Big patches of disgusting, yellow fat squeezed out to seal the wound shut. It seemed as if nothing had happened to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He glared at He Caitou with his small eyes and leapt up suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Imagine a mountain of meat jumping up, that was what Lu Genggeng appeared like right now. He wasn’t jumping towards He Caitou, but flipped his body backward instead. He was plummeting towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er, trying to crush them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only this, but his first soul ring also lit up. Gusts of greenish, poisonous fog were released around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Huo Yuhao was much smaller than Lu Genggeng, he was much less flexible right now compared to him. Even Wang Dong’er’s expression changed when she saw the meat mountain plummeting down at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her wings opened up at this moment. She let go of Huo Yuhao’s wheelchair and flipped around. She left Huo Yuhao alone as he faced Lu Genggeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er lifted her wings up high in the air, and unleashed the Hexagram Array again. This time, it shot towards Yan Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Feng exploited this opportunity to gain altitude as he beat his wings.</span></p>

Among the younger generation, Lu Genggeng wasn’t the most outstanding in the Holy Ghost Church. Whether it was Yan Feng or the Sacred Lady Tang Ya, their cultivations were above him.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even when he was struck by the Class 7 piercing cannon, he acted as if nothing had happened.</span></p>

Even though the light pierced through his fat, his fat was like his armor. As long as the core of his body wasn’t struck, he could still recover even if thousands of holes were made on his body.</span></p>

He didn’t care about Wang Dong’er’s attack. To him, it wasn’t much of a threat even though it was light-type.</span></p>

Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan were rushing over, Xu Sanshi sticking close to Jiang Nannan now. She could use the same method as she had with Xiao Xiao to help him join the fight quickly.</span></p>

He lifted his right hand slowly, and the Snow Lady drifted out of his forehead.</span></p>

The Snow Lady suddenly turned illusory, and she also grew in size at the same time. The arrogant face of the Snow Empress re-appeared once again. The golden projection behind Huo Yuhao than fused with his body. One golden and one white projection fused into his body at the same time!</span></p>
