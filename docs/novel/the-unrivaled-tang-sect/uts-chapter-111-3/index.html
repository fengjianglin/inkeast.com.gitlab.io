 <p><strong>Book 13: Life Gold</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 111.3: Blaze Amidst the Frost, the Heavenly Emperor's Hammer!</strong></p>
 <p>The ice wasn’t the only thing that shattered into pieces. Her clothes, which had been roasted and frozen in turn and thus become extremely fragile, separated at the seams as well. Ma Xiaotao didn’t have a single thread on her body by the time all the ice had fallen to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ah –” Ma Xiaotao gasped softly, but realized she couldn’t move at all. She felt as if all the blood vessels in her body had been frozen solid, and her blood circulation was unbearably slow. She couldn’t even sense a single trace of her phoenix flames, let alone the evil fire. It felt as if her entire body had gone into stasis, and she was just a statue made of ice.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao’s movement shocked Huo Yuhao awake. A person waking up would naturally and subconsciously move his or her body, and the thin layer of ice over Huo Yuhao’s body broke and drifted to the ground as well. He was in the same situation as Ma Xiaotao – besides the Twenty Four Moonlit Bridges around his waist, every other piece of fabric on his body broke apart and fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ah –” Huo Yuhao exclaimed in similar fashion before he immediately found that he could only see a patch of white before him.</p>
 <p>“What are you shrieking about?! And you shouted even louder than I did, as if you just suffered a loss.” Ma Xiaotao was furious.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao finally saw the person before him clearly. How would one describe the scene before his eyes? Extreme perkiness, buxom, tender and delicate bright-red peaches, and… and… “Close your eyes!” Ma Xiaotao said indignantly.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao recovered at once, and hurriedly covered his vital parts with his hands as he closed his eyes at once. However, what he just saw had been imprinted in the deep recesses of his mind. In fact, he felt as if he could see with more clarity with his eyes closed.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was still panting faintly. She began to feel a touch of warmth as her blood flow started to smooth out. Her physical strength was far superior to normal people, after all.</p>
 <p>She recited her mental cultivation technique in her mind and the phoenix flames within her body were gradually awoken. Ma Xiaotao realized, to her intense shock, that the suppression of evil fire in her body was far more complete than the last time. There seemed to be a black pearl within her soul power that was located in the center of her pubic region. Furthermore, her own soul power also became a lot clearer and brighter, and there wasn’t a single vestige of evil fire to be found.</p>
 <p>Ultimate Ice was so powerful! Ma Xiaotao finally comprehended how inappropriate it was for her to seek Huo Yuhao’s help to suppress the evil fire, as Huo Yuhao’s body was clearly exhausted, and he had overdrafted his energy back then.</p>
 <p>“Hey, are you okay?” Ma Xiaotao asked softly.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine.” Huo Yuhao had a feeling as if he wanted to cry, but there were no tears in his eyes. A young virgin boy like him was simply just full of vitality and liveliness. He had some natural reactions subconsciously after seeing something he shouldn’t have, and he felt like his hands were unable to cover him up any longer. All he could do was bend his body and point his buttocks upwards to avoid exposing his buffoonery as much as possible.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao heaved a soft sigh of relief and didn’t ask any more questions. Strangely, the bathroom just maintained this tranquil state.</p>
 <p>The stiffness in Ma Xiaotao’s body gradually vanished following the phoenix flames’ circulation in her body, and an unprecedented relief and comfort coursed through her entire body, giving her indescribable satisfaction.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao really wanted to moan out loud to express her pleasure, and would have if Huo Yuhao hadn’t been there.</p>
 <p>Could it be because the evil fire had been entirely suppressed? Ma Xiaotao knew that the answer wasn’t so simple. When her body wasn’t so stiff anymore, she immediately felt something sticky between her legs that made her extremely awkward and uncomfortable. What disturbed her even more was the fact that her long and powerful thighs felt a little weak.</p>
 <p>She cursed under her breath, and color returned to her pretty face. She glanced at Huo Yuhao and she had an epiphany as she watched his strange behavior.</p>
 <p>She immediately raised her leg, kicked him in the chest and sent him tumbling out of the bathroom.</p>
 <p>“Put your clothes on and wait for me outside. I’m not going to let you leave. You’re not allowed to leave.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao’s kick seemed heavy and hard, but it was a force that was meant to push him out, and not injure him. Huo Yuhao rolled once inside the bathroom, got on his feet and barreled outside as if he had just received divine forgiveness.</p>
 <p>He hurriedly shut the door behind him once he was out of the bathroom and immediately started to pant in deep breaths.</p>
 <p>Torture, this was torture. Besides feeling as if he was being tortured, all he felt was bewilderment. How many distracting thoughts could he have in his mind at such a young age? However, males and females were different, after all, and there was bound to be curiosity about the opposite gender. Still, seeing something that one shouldn’t have seen would undoubtedly produce a certain measure of fear. Huo Yuhao swiftly put on some clothes he had stored inside the Twenty-Four Moonlit Bridges, and then he was stood just inside Ma Xiaotao’s room feeling extremely unsettled. He really wanted to dart back to his own room, but what if Ma Xiaotao wouldn’t forgive him for running off just like that?</p>
 <p>Furthermore, what made him even more anxious and exasperated was the fact that he just recalled the incident where he grabbed onto Xiaotao’s buttocks. He didn’t just see them – he had touched them! What was that?</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao wasn’t nervous and stressed like Huo Yuhao was. She used her phoenix flames to melt the ice freezing up the water pipes and immediately switched on the shower tap. Flowing water rinsed over her smooth and impeccable skin, and this refreshing sensation instantly increased the invigorating feeling within her body.</p>
 <p>She was already nineteen years of age, and she was far more mature than Huo Yuhao in terms of both mind and body. Even though she was still embarrassed about what had just transpired, her current thoughts and feelings were very different from his.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao reached up and touched her hot cheeks as she reminisced over her repeated experiences of the tribulations of ice and fire, and the feeling of her arrival at the pinnacle of bliss.</p>
 <p>“What a little bastard. Could this be an attempt at revenge?” She immediately recalled Huo Yuhao’s dilemma and predicament inside the Sea God’s Lake – except, it was her this time.</p>
 <p>“Whatever the case, I still have to thank him.” Ma Xiaotao gasped once more as she checked the evil fire within her pubic regions. She thought about Huo Yuhao’s panic and bewilderment and she slowly withdrew the smile on her face as she tapped herself on the forehead. What was that? A single episode could be called an accident, but this was the second time. “He’s just a kid. I can’t corrupt him like that.”</p>
 <p>Her thoughts stopped there as Ma Xiaotao quickly washed her body, dried herself and found a change of clean clothes before she stepped out of the bathroom.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was sitting on the sofa with his head lowered and both hands on his knees. His back was as straight as an arrow, and his appearance was just like a kid who knew he had done something wrong – even his face was flushed red.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao found his behavior extremely cute and amusing, and couldn’t help but giggle at the sight.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hurriedly stood up as if he had just been shocked. He didn’t even dare to look up at Ma Xiaotao. His head was still lowered as he said, “Xiaotao, I… I made a mistake. It really wasn’t on purpose. I… I messed up.”</p>
 <p>“That’s enough. What’s all this talk about messing up? The person saying sorry should be me.” Ma Xiaotao tried to keep her tone as composed as possible as she stepped over to Huo Yuhao and touched his head. “Sit down.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was caught off guard by this amicable behavior. He had thought that she was going to rage at him, considering her typical short temper and fiery personality.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao pulled on Huo Yuhao to sit him down before she took a seat on the sofa opposite him.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, Yuhao. The evil fire was already attacking my heart, and I dragged you back here in my dazed state and directly forced the evil fire into your body. Fortunately, I didn’t cause any damage to you. You didn’t do anything wrong – I was the one who made a mistake. I wasn’t thinking straight through all my anger, and triggered my evil fire to attack them, except I forgot you were already exhausted and couldn’t immediately help me suppress the evil hidden within my phoenix flames. Thankfully, you’re okay. Otherwise I’d really regret this till the day I died.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao’s tone was extremely serious and solemn, and her pretty face was full of sincerity.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao stared blankly at her, but the anxiety and butterflies in his stomach had mostly receded.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao continued, “Luckily, nothing happened to you. I don’t think you’ll be able to explain what happened, and it’s the same for me. The evil fire was affecting my mind and my rationality. As for what happened afterwards…” Her face turned red as she said this, and she hurriedly held back her emotions before she continued, “It was just an accident. Everything came about by accident, and I hope this won’t disturb you or cause you any trauma. You’re still young, and you’re not at the age where you should pine after women, so don’t think too much. What you should be doing is focus on cultivating – do you understand?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes, I understand…” Huo Yuhao acknowledged repeatedly. He never expected Ma Xiaotao to give a speech like that. While he relaxed his emotions, he developed a certain level of reverence and admiration for this girl before him.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao watched his behavior and felt he was getting cuter by the second. She couldn’t help himself, and giggled once more as she said, “Alright, that’s enough. You don’t have to be so prim and proper. Even though I almost messed up big time and I almost hurt you, you didn’t lose out, did you? You’re the first one to touch my body besides my family members – and it’s not even the first time.”</p>
 <p>“I…” Huo Yuhao wanted to explain himself, but had no idea what to say as he blushed again.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao laughed and said, “It’s okay. You’re still young, and I don’t mean anything else by it. You’ve touched my body, and that’s it. You’re still a kid, so I’m not about to bicker with you about this. You’re almost eight years younger than me, and you can call me sister if you’re willing to. This way, you can be considered my family, and my reputation and integrity won’t be tarnished. The next time I need your help to suppress evil will therefore be right and proper. Of course, being my little brother is a good thing – I will take revenge on whoever dares to bully you by roasting him into a suckling pig. How’s that?”</p>
 <p>“Sister…” A sour sensation rushed into Huo Yuhao’s nose, and tears poured out of his eyes instantly.</p>
 <p>Tears were products of grief, but they were also products of when one was deeply moved. Ma Xiaotao’s words probably didn’t mean much to normal people, but it wasn’t the same for him.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had been interdependent with his mother ever since he was a kid, and he had long been used to the hypocritical indifference in the Duke’s Mansion. He had had no other kin besides his mother, who had always swallowed her anger.</p>
 <p>He had met Bei Bei and Tang Ya when he first joined Shrek Academy, and that was when his icy heart began to gradually change, and the cold sensations in his heart slowly turned into warmth.</p>
 <p>Even Wang Dong didn’t know that Huo Yuhao’s thoughts had been extreme and radical when he had first moved into the dorm with him, just that Huo Yuhao channeled this extremity into silent determination in cultivation and tried his best to improve himself. Huo Yuhao’s hatred towards the Duke’s Mansion was still very strong at that time, to the point where he wanted to end the White Tiger Duke’s lineage and bloodline once and for all.</p>
