 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not soul engineers?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao made an accurate judgment immediately. Not only were these two not soul engineers, but they were even a very familiar type of soul master – evil soul masters! They were evil soul masters from the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two evil Titled Douluo were unfamiliar to Huo Yuhao. However, his expression immediately turned serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil soul masters found it very easy in the early stages of their cultivation. They were able to improve by leaps and bounds. However, it was very difficult for an evil soul master to become a Titled Douluo. It was even harder for them compared to ordinary soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, evil soul masters that could become Titled Douluo were undoubtedly elites among evil soul masters. These two had to be honorary elders of the Holy Ghost Church even if they weren’t from the Worship Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Ghost Church had actually deployed two evil soul masters here. It seemed like they must have hatched some kind of plot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted, and strengthened the release of his spiritual power. Right now, both he and Tang Wutong were within his Spiritual Interference Domain. The two evil soul masters couldn’t tell their appearances. His immense spiritual power also kept the two evil soul masters busy, such that they couldn’t be bothered with anything else for now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both parties were at a stalemate, but the battlefield was thundering. Lights were also scattering everywhere. The soul formation at the top of the northern city walls was also being intensely bombed. Its linked defense was on the verge of collapsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire had deployed a total of a hundred and fifty soul engineers here. A hundred of them were at the bottom of the city walls, while the other fifty were deployed at the top. Although the soul engineers at the top used their powerful linked defense to resist the attack of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, they were also being drained much more quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this were a normal situation where the enemies came from outside the city, the soul engineers in the city would be able to hang on. They could even combine their linked defenses at the top and bottom of the walls, generating an even stronger defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, things were extremely chaotic at the bottom right now. Bei Bei and the other three were mercilessly killing soul engineers within the soul formation. How could anyone even be bothered by what was going on at the top?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were not anxious at all. Whether it was Bei Bei and the other three or He Caitou who managed to achieve what they wanted, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong stood to benefit. If they weren’t anxious, they wouldn’t easily reveal their own flaws. This was the simplest fighting strategy, but it was very effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two evil soul masters soon realized this, and they turned extremely grim. While Huo Yuhao was stunned by them, they were also equally astonished by the fact that so many powerful individuals had appeared here. In addition, there was even a soul engineer legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How strong was the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion? In the sky, every figure shone with the light of six soul rings. The entire soul engineer legion was made up of Soul Emperors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion might be less well-equipped than the outstanding soul engineer legions of the Sun Moon Empire. However, not a single soul engineer legion, even in the Sun Moon Empire, was as well-equipped with soul masters as the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion. Not even the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was an exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given this, the soul engineers at the top of the city walls were about to be taken down under the all-out attack of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of you are courting death!” The Titled Douluo on the left shouted before he lifted his right hand. His body immediately shone with two yellow, two purple and five black soul rings. A pitch-black flag also appeared within his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This entire flag was black, even up to its flagpole. However, there subtly seemed to be countless purplish-black indignant souls flashing above this flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Myriad Soul Banner! This evil soul master’s nickname was Myriad Soul. He was the Myriad Soul Douluo, a Rank 91 evil Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other evil soul master by his side also unleashed his martial soul. The Myriad Soul Douluo was a Tool Soul Master, while he was a Beast Soul Master. His body immediately expanded, and his skin seemed as if it were going to tear apart. Thick greenish fog quickly spread from his body. Very soon, he was more than twenty meters tall, and his waistline grew to more than twenty meters. He was like a monster now. He was actually a living creature, an Abomination, that existed in Huo Yuhao’s spectral demiplane too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao started to recite incantations. Tang Wutong flashed, and came in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He placed both his hands on her slim waist, maintaining their Haodong Power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s eyes suddenly turned extremely bright. Sonorous dragon roars rang through the air. In front of her, a huge golden dragon head gradually surfaced. Following this, the dragon head opened its mouth wide, and balls of golden light shot towards the two evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the second soul skill of the Radiant Dragon Butterfly, Dragon God’s Fury!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to remember that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could unleash the abilities of a Transcendent Douluo when they came together as one entity. This was Dragon God’s Fury at the level of a Transcendent Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every ball of light appeared very real. Wherever they passed, the air would actually weirdly collapse. It was as if the air was a wall, which was dented as the Dragon God’s Fury shot past. It was indeed very weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo’s figure flashed before he arrived in front them. His Myriad Soul Banner moved along with the winds, and tragic screams echoed as sinister winds blew. The banner was about to engulf the balls of light unleashed by Dragon God’s Fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something weird happened at this moment. The balls of light suddenly unfurled in mid-air, turning into small golden dragons. These dragons bared their teeth as they clawed towards the banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The avenging spirits that were released from the Myriad Soul Banner were instantly torn apart as they faced the golden dragons, which were filled with an aura of light. Suddenly, the sky turned extremely bright, and the sinister aura that was previously in the air was swept away under the effect of Dragon God’s Fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo’s expression changed immediately. These avenging spirits were the source of his strength. He shouted, and the third soul ring of his Myriad Soul Banner shone brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Myriad Soul Banner enlarged ten times over, and reached towards all the small golden dragons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Abomination Douluo had already taken a big step by now, and was charging towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enlarged Myriad Soul Banner was actually very resilient. When it engulfed all the small golden dragons, it seemed as if countless souls had devoured them. Instantly, it really felt as if Dragon God’s Fury had been completely suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold look flashed across Tang Wutong’s face. The golden dragon head in front of her shone brightly all of a sudden. Following this, tremendous booms rang from the Myriad Soul Banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo shouted in fury and quickly staggered back. The aura released from his Myriad Soul Banner seemed to weaken a little. Evidently, he had suffered greatly from Tang Wutong’s retaliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil soul masters could indeed curb most martial souls. However, Tang Wutong’s top-grade Radiant Dragon Butterfly couldn’t be curbed by any ordinary evil soul master. If not for the fact that Huo Yuhao was reciting incantations right now, which affected the circulation of their Haodong Power, Tang Wutong would have been able to hurt the Myriad Soul Douluo with her earlier blow, given her abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Abomination Douluo rushed forward. He opened his arms, and a huge patch of greenish fog swept towards Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao. A dark-greenish fluid also seeped out from his skin as his terrifying figure approached.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge chain also appeared in the Abomination Douluo’s hand. On a closer look, one could discover that it was formed by linking skulls together. These skulls didn’t belong to humans. Instead, they seemed to come from different living creatures. They were filled with intense vengeance and sinister auras. At the top of the chain, there was a hook made from an unknown bone structure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Abomination Douluo swung his hand forward, his huge chain whipped towards Tang Wutong’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the Abomination Douluo, Tang Wutong was extremely small. However, she was still fearless in the face of such a powerful opponent. She lifted her arms in front of her body and clasped her palms above her head. Her dragon wings came together at this point, engulfing Huo Yuhao within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A giant blade of light appeared in mid-air as if it had just cut open the heavens. It was more than ten meters long. As Tang Wutong swept her hands down, the huge blade slashed down, echoing the furious roar of a dragon at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ding!” The Abomination Douluo’s chain collided against the blade of light, and was instantly struck away. Three different projections suddenly appeared on the Abomination Douluo’s body. He wanted to avoid the incoming blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the blade was simply too quick. As light flashed, the Abomination Douluo roared furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three projections combined to form one, and a huge wound appeared on the Abomination Douluo’s shoulder. This was the result even after he used a defensive soul skill to take most of the offensive strength from the light blade. Otherwise, he would be in an even more tragic state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was forcefully resisting two evil Titled Douluo. Not only did she not lose out, but she even suppressed her opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo had caught his breath by now. He was staring fiercely at Tang Wutong. His sixth soul ring lit up, and he raised his Myriad Soul Banner up high. His black banner exuded a bluish rippling glow, causing it to appear deep-blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This deep-blue was as deep as the color of the sea. Following this, twelve avenging spirits flew out from the banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These avenging spirits were all deep-blue.

This avenging spirit had long hair that flowed all the way behind his head. Its entire body even exuded a blue glow. It was just that there was spirit fire dancing in its eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other eleven avenging spirits also took different forms. The only similar characteristic between all of them was that they were aquatic creatures. They should be aquatic soul beasts.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This evil soul master actually controls the avenging spirits formed from aquatic soul beasts.</span></p>
