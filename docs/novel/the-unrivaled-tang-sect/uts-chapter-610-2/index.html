 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King was intelligent. He could clearly feel what Huo Yuhao was experiencing, because he wouldn’t have done anything otherwise. What he could do was wait for an opportunity when something was happening to Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Huo Yuhao couldn’t control the soul power within his body, and once the Evileye Tyrant King completely unleashed his havoc, then Huo Yuhao’s soul core would no longer be stable. That was the best time for possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King was still pleased with being able to possess an Ultimate Douluo’s body. He had had a chance to escape with his spirit when Huo Yuhao killed him, and he could even be reborn through one of his descendant’s bodies. The Evileye Tyrant King had a very formidable spirit, and killing him completely wasn’t that easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he didn’t choose that, because he had his eyes on Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s strength would be greatly affected if he had chosen one of his descendants for rebirth, and he would need a long time to regain his peak condition. That was still possible back then, and all he needed was more time. That was the conservative choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he couldn’t make the same choice this time because he was about to face his next tribulation, and his tribulation wouldn’t care if he was severely injured or if he had been reborn through possession. The tribulation would target his soul, and the Evileye Tyrant King wasn’t confident of successfully making it through this great tribulation even if he was at his peak. He didn’t have formidable life energy like the Beast God did, not to mention when he was already severely injured. He would truly meet his demise once that tribulation struck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he chose to take the riskier path after some thought, and he chose to possess Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao had guessed, the Evileye Tyrant King was certain that Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly abandon such a formidable soul ring, and the Evileye Tyrant King would still have time to possess one of his descendants even if Huo Yuhao did forgo it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And once Huo Yuhao absorbed his soul ring, the Evileye Tyrant King would aim to find a chance to possess his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soul beast’s body couldn’t conceal his aura, but a human body could! Furthermore, Huo Yuhao had such a high cultivation and formidable soul power. If the Evileye Tyrant King could succeed in possessing his body and complete his third soul core, then he would be absolutely confident of making it through his next tribulation. He could even use this human body to break through into the God Realm. The Evileye Tyrant King was overcome with intense greed, and that was the reason why he chose this riskier path. It seemed like his opportunity had come, and success was within his grasp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, he wasn’t hasty at all. He was waiting for something to happen to Huo Yuhao’s body before he would make an all-out attack. He didn’t want to ruin this body, because what would be the point of possession if that happened? He had to wait until Huo Yuhao was about to crumble before he could take control over his body. Afterwards, he would rely on his formidable spiritual power after fusing with Huo Yuhao’s body to control the violent revolting soul power, suppress it, and slowly absorb it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King became increasingly satisfied with the current situation as he continued to think. Everything was going better than he had expected: a perfect body, a perfect type, and a spiritual sea that was so powerful that it could carry his spiritual power. There was still the soul power that was unabsorbed but extremely pure, and the shape of a third soul core was within reach. This was the best kind of gift that the heavens could give him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bluish-green shadow glimmered into view behind Huo Yuhao in this moment. She wasn’t considered extremely beautiful, but her ice-cold aura and majestic elegance, her perfect and alluring body, and her jade-green frame gave off a unique and exotic beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was having it easier as she sat opposite Huo Yuhao. Her golden sun and purple moon’s light flickered as they radiated and dimmed continuously. Even though she was unstable, her undulations weren’t as vigorous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao’s situation was a lot worse. His golden sun flourished, but his blue moon was exceptionally dim as thick mist steamed from his body. His clothes were completely soaked as large beads of sweat rolled down from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress took a deep breath. Her body became like her scorpion’s tail, and glowed with brilliant jade-green light. That green color wasn’t one that was filled with life, but one that was cold to the extreme. The mist that rose from Huo Yuhao’s body was immediately transformed into countless ice particles that drifted down, and the cavern was cleansed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress’ eyes sparkled like two pillars of icy flames. She crossed her legs, sat down behind Huo Yuhao, and pressed one palm against his back. She moved closer to his body, and pressed her other hand on Huo Yuhao’s dantian. Thick green flames burned within her eyes in the next moment, and green hues permeated the entire cavern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not a single inch of iciness was released, and the Ice Empress slowly closed her eyes as she burned her spiritual sense, and a faint smile appeared on her beautiful face while her own voice echoed in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You’re so silly, Skydream. I’m not very eloquent, and I don’t really know what to say, but I can remember everything you’ve done for me over the years. Even though I’m cold, you’ve melted me, and this is all I can do. This is the best kind of love I can give you. I’m burning my spiritual sense, and we will no longer be separated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Icy waves surged into Huo Yuhao’s body, and the revolting soul power within his dantian immediately quieted. Not because his soul power stopped circulating, but because it was frozen by those strange icy waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s soul power was formidable, but the Ice Empress was burning her spiritual sense, and the power of her spirit wasn’t inferior to that of an Ultimate Douluo! That was pure freezing power, and both spiritual power and soul power would be instantly frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression became a lot calmer as the soul power within his dantian froze. He slowly took a deep breath, and his aura was as solemn as ever. There seemed to be dragon roars echoing through the air with his exhalation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in the most pain that he could be in right before the Ice Empress began burning her spiritual sense. Of course, he knew that he had been tricked, and this was happening to him because he had been too eager for success. However, he couldn’t possibly have made another choice under those circumstances as he thought back over the situation. The Skydream Iceworm had given him a guarantee, and the seven hundred thousand year soul ring was so alluring that he couldn’t possibly turn it away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the Skydream Iceworm was around. The Skydream Iceworm had absorbed much of the Evileye Tyrant King’s soul power inside his soul ring, and Huo Yuhao was only absorbing a small portion with his spiritual sea. This resulted in the Evileye Tyrant King only being able to mobilize part of his spiritual power when moving against Huo Yuhao, in an attempt to consume Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power to strengthen himself. The Evileye Tyrant King could only reabsorb the spiritual power from the Skydream Iceworm once he had strengthened himself to a certain extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, the Skydream Iceworm made the Evileye Tyrant King’s possession process much more challenging and complicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But even then, the soul power in Huo Yuhao’s body was too violent, and shocked his body so much that he couldn’t resist the Evileye Tyrant King’s absorption at all. Huo Yuhao was experiencing so much pain that he couldn’t fight back at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress burning her spiritual sense was like a lifeline to Huo Yuhao at a time like this, and the soul power within his body immediately settled down as he heaved a long sigh of relief. Huo Yuhao relied on his formidable spiritual power as he exhaled, and he readjusted and realigned all the disorganized soul power within his body. His Yin Yang Complement soul cores began to spin stably again, and immense gravitational forces appeared once more that withdrew and took back the chaotic soul power and spiritual power running through his passageways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King naturally discovered the big changes in Huo Yuhao as soon as they occurred, and he turned pale with fright. He had already exposed himself, and he understood that if Huo Yuhao regained the upper hand, then there was nothing left for him but death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King no longer had his original body. Even though he had taken his spirit and his essence with him, he was still quite a far cry from Huo Yuhao, who was an Ultimate Douluo and had Yin Yang Complement soul cores. The Evileye Tyrant King didn’t have a single chance if Huo Yuhao could concentrate all his attention on dealing with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King had no choice at a time like this, and he didn’t even have time to think as he launched his attack as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King couldn’t let Huo Yuhao catch his breath as the energy that he had hidden within Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea erupted, and a single wheel of evil light glowed above it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had his legs crossed, and a blood-red Evileye surfaced behind his back. Evil light flickered as the entire cave was tainted red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was already in meditation. Even though her situation was a lot better than Huo Yuhao, she had to concentrate fully if she wanted to completely absorb the vast soul power that Ye Xishui had left behind for her, and she had to do so while in meditation. Therefore, she didn’t know such big problems were happening to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s entire body trembled, and a vertical eye gradually opened on his forehead. However, there were no longer any rose gold sun patterns around his vertical eye. Instead, there were strange dark red patterns thatwere like tiny snakes that climbed out from his vertical eye and began spreading throughout his head, like they were about to swallow his entire skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King used his full strength in this attack. The Ice Empress, who was standing behind Huo Yuhao, was overcome with fear, as she didn’t expect the Evileye Tyrant King to have hidden such formidable power within Huo Yuhao’s body, to the point where he almost couldn’t resist at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao finally stabilized all the soul power within his body with the Ice Empress’ help, though the intense agony made him feel like his spiritual sea was being torn apart. His spiritual sea’s water had been completely solidified, and cracks began to appear as liquid that resembled dark red lava emerged from those cracks. They quickly permeated across his entire spiritual sea, and the goal was simple: he had to consume this entire spiritual sea!</span></p>
