 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why? Why?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was only delayed in the air for two seconds before he returned to normal. However, he didn’t continue attacking. He turned around and fled. At that instant, he rushed out from the sonic blast. Instantly, he traveled more than a hundred kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clenched his left hand and used his Ice Explosion Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From afar, a terrifying boom rocked the entire Evildemon Forest. It lasted very long without fading away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the helmet was removed, it was not Huo Yuhao’s face, but Tang Wutong’s instead. No, more accurately speaking, it should be the Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost, Raiment of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, from the moment that lethal strike was unleashed, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were already fused together. The Solitary Dance Amidst the Frost, Raiment of Light gave them the ability to directly resist the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From their earlier clashes, Huo Yuhao deeply understood that he and Tang Wutong might not be the Evileye Tyrant King’s match. It was a difference in absolute ability. However, he still chose to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was all heaven’s will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with the Icy War God’s Armor, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could only directly resist the Evileye Tyrant King for a short period of time using their Raiment of Light. However, against the Evileye Tyrant King’s terrifying explosive strength and immensely strong spiritual power, they could only flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they still managed to kill the Evileye Tyrant King. How?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Huo Yuhao could answer why. He had used his immunity to three spiritual attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had completely neutralized the Evileye Tyrant King’s strongest three spiritual attacks using this immunity. It was also an important reason why he managed to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he didn’t suffer from the attacks, he could easily use the buffer time after the Evileye Tyrant King attacked to counterattack with all his power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used the Heavenly Emperor’s Hammer to wreck the Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two streaks of Spiritual Shock that were unleashed from the Sigh of the Frozen Goddess along with the Merfolk’s Duet fatally wounded the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The close to absolute zero temperature of Ultimate Ice was completely infused into his spiritual attacks. It was the strength of the Goddess of Light, a combination of Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s powers. Everything led to that ultimate strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong dazedly drifted beside Huo Yuhao. Until now, both of them still felt as if they were in a dream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have we, have we succeeded?” Tang Wutong softly asked Huo Yuhao. “That was a savage beast that’s only inferior to Di Tian! He was ranked second among the Ten Great Savage Beasts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at Tang Wutong and hugged her. “Yes, we’ve really succeeded. We’ve killed the Evileye Tyrant King. We’ve really succeeded!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a close and dangerous fight. Right now, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s soul power was at less than 20 percent. If Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui didn’t increase their cultivations to Rank 98, they wouldn’t have stood a chance at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao was immunized from the Evileye Tyrant King’s spiritual attacks, that still had to be sustained. If not for the fact that their martial soul fusion made the Goddess of Light’s strength almost boundless, they wouldn’t have survived the Space-Time Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twice! Huo Yuhao couldn’t imagine the consequences if he wasn’t immunized. Even if he didn’t die, he would have become a moron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, they had finally succeeded. The Evileye Tyrant King had been killed just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go, let’s go.” Tang Wutong held onto Huo Yuhao. They both flew back towards the Evildemon Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky was still deep blue. The Evileye Tyrant King was simply too strong. Even until now, his aura had not fully dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were dark red patches of blood on the ground, as well as big lumps of the Evileye Tyrant King’s corpse. There were even a few items that caught Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, there was the Morning Dew Dagger. It had not changed as it drifted in mid-air. Apart from the dagger, there was a dark red halo with seven golden patterns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the center of the halo, there was a dark-blue pupil. It was only the size of a palm, but it was flashing with a demonic glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is this? Soul bone?” Huo Yuhao was astonished to see what was in the center of the soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For soul beasts with cultivations above a hundred thousand years, powerful hundred thousand year soul bones would appear along with their hundred thousand year soul rings. However, it was Huo Yuhao’s first time seeing such a soul bone. Even in the records of Shrek Academy, there were no such soul bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What kind of soul bone is this?” Tang Wutong asked, curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said. “I don’t know either. It seems like it’s an external soul bone. It should be a pupil too. I just don’t know how we should use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was excited as she said, “Of course, you have to directly absorb it. Your martial soul is your Spirit Eyes. It’s the most suitable for absorbing such a soul bone. I didn’t expect an eye to be a soul bone too! This is too magical.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao brought Tang Wutong as they flew over. First, he grabbed the Morning Dew Dagger and put it away before guiding the soul ring and bone over using his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his spiritual power interacted with the soul ring, he instantly felt a strong sense of discrimination coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, it was the intent of the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this wasn’t a problem for Huo Yuhao. If the Evileye Tyrant King were still alive, Huo Yuhao would naturally not be his foe. Now that he was already dead, Huo Yuhao probably possessed the strongest spiritual cultivation in the world. It was not an issue for him to guide the soul ring and bone over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He increased the output of his soul power, and guided the soul ring and bone to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a hundred thousand year soul ring with seven golden patterns on it! Among all the soul rings Huo Yuhao had, only the Skydream Iceworm’s million year soul ring was superior to it. But the Skydream Iceworm was far inferior compared to the Evileye Tyrant King when he was alive. Even when he was at his million year cultivation, he would still have to beg for his life if he faced the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, the Evileye Tyrant King had actually transformed into a soul ring. To Huo Yuhao, he was no longer just delightfully surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was excited. “Quickly, absorb it. I’ll protect you. Our soul powers recover very quickly. In this forest, no one else can threaten us apart from the Evileye Tyrant King. Quickly, absorb it. Perhaps you might start to touch the door to your third soul core.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao agreed before he sat cross-legged on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he was about to absorb the soul ring, a white light flashed before the Snow Empress crawled out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, wait a minute.” The Snow Empress was very serious as she spoke to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was puzzled as he asked, “What’s wrong, Snow Empress?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress furrowed her brow and replied, “I’m afraid you’ll meet with problems if you try to absorb the Evileye Tyrant King’s soul ring now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Huo Yuhao knew that the Snow Empress wouldn’t warn him for nothing. He had never absorbed such a powerful soul ring before. He immediately stopped and listened to her explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “If that human Ultimate Douluo didn’t give you his soul power, it shouldn’t be a problem. Absorbing the Evileye Tyrant King’s soul ring would only make your cultivation much better. However, things are different now. You have too much soul power in your body. Although you’ve just drained a lot, it’ll recover very quickly. You can’t immediately form your third soul core. Once you absorb the Evileye Tyrant King’s soul ring, you’ll likely face a situation where there’s too much soul power in your body. Eventually, you won’t be able to release or absorb soul power. Your life might even be in danger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is indeed a problem. However, I didn’t bring any soul ring-sealing soul tools.” Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. It was luck that he could kill the Evileye Tyrant King, as well as because of the spiritual immunity. If he didn’t absorb this seven hundred thousand year soul ring, it would dissipate soon!</span></p>

She knew how dangerous it was earlier. In fact, both she and Huo Yuhao did conserve some power after they transformed into the Goddess of Light. They were ready to flee. Huo Yuhao even had three Class 9 stationary shells. No matter how strong the Evileye Tyrant King was, they were still enough to help them escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that they had toiled to kill such a powerful creature, they couldn’t bear to give up his soul ring! The soul bone was still fine. It could still be absorbed later. But what about the soul ring?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao couldn’t take the risk either. No one knew how much power was contained within a seven hundred thousand year soul ring. It was immense strength that could help even a Transcendent Douluo improve further! If something went wrong, it would be fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No worries, you still have me!” A naughty-sounding voice was heard. Following this, golden lights flashed, and one more person appeared beside Huo Yuhao. It was the Skydream Iceworm, whom he had not seen for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm looked very delighted right now. He placed his hands behind his back, as if he was very satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Skydream, you have a plan?” Huo Yuhao was delightfully surprised as he looked at the Skydream Iceworm.</span></p>
