 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I’d like to try when the fight in Eastern Sun City is over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong looked at the Snow and Ice Empresses and asked, “Will there be any danger?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress replied, “If you don’t go to deep into the Ice Sea, there shouldn’t be much of a problem. I’ll appear then. Even the Mermaid will need to show some face to me. At the same time, it will also depend on whether you get lucky. Although I believe that the probability of success isn’t huge, I’ll still accompany you since you want to go there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Alright, that’s it then. Please return now. We are about to begin our mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow and Ice Empresses turned into two streaks of flowing light and returned to Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted slightly and said, “If I can obtain my eighth soul ring this time, I can try for my second soul core after a period of consolidation. The probability of success will also be greater.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong asked, “Are you still sticking with the Yin Yang Complement? I still feel that it’s too dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled as he said, “I still have to give it a shot. Otherwise, I won’t be convinced. My future goal is to defeat Di Tian. If I can’t get a soul core that’s as strong as his, how can I do so? Since I’ll need to challenge him one day, I must do so in my best state. Even if I fail, I can still use the other method. My greatest advantage is my age. I still have enough time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong rolled her eyes and said, “You are really stubborn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled and got closer to her before pecking her on the cheek. After this, he said, “Don’t you like how stubborn I am?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pui! Who likes your stubbornness?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, “Oh, it’s called persistence, isn’t it? You like my persistence. Persistence and stubbornness are synonyms. There’s not much difference between the two. Let’s go and find a place. I really wish to cuddle you and sleep.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong laughed and said, “Come on then! I’ll let you do whatever you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression immediately turned bitter. “Your seal will come and give me trouble even before three seconds is up. Haih, when can I see my father-in-law, who’s the only one who can solve this problem!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong also pinched the soft flesh on his waist and said, “I think this is a rather good arrangement. Let’s take it as a test for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao appeared sorrowful, “This test is too difficult.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the two of them spoke, they approached a nearby inn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go in there.” Huo Yuhao led Tang Wutong into the inn. They asked for a room and used a gold soul coin to purchase a map of Eastern Sun City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This inn was squeaky clean. Apart from its cleanliness, there was nothing about it that could be raved about. However, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong weren’t there for a holiday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They entered their room and closed the door. Huo Yuhao then began to recite incantations. In just a few seconds, a pitch-black door silently opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the concealment of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power, it was impossible to sense any energy undulations coming from this door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at Tang Wutong. Her body flashed, and she entered the spectral demiplane. Huo Yuhao couldn’t leave right now, as he had to maintain the energy barrier around the door. Otherwise, any soul master that passed by would be able to sense the sinister aura and immense soul power undulations coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long afterward, Tang Wutong returned. Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, He Caitou, Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao were with her. It was a gathering of the members of Shrek’s Seven Monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei asked Huo Yuhao, “I heard from Wutong that you’ve encountered some trouble?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered, “A little, but it shouldn’t be a huge problem. Eldest senior, come here and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone gathered around a table, which was covered in the map that Huo Yuhao had purchased earlier. He had already marked out some points on it. Among them, he specially used a red marking for a place in the north of the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Through the earlier use of my Spiritual Detection, I discovered that there are thirty thousand troops stationed in this city, as well as a soul master legion formed by a total of a hundred and fifty soul masters. Just inside the northern city gates, there’s a soul formation, which I believe is stronger than the one that we destroyed before. The soul tools there are all the newest types. Furthermore, there are many spiritual detection soul tools. Honestly speaking, it does curb my Spiritual Detection and surveillance abilities, such that I’m unable to use my Spiritual Detection to clearly find out what’s going on inside. Earlier, I unintentionally triggered their spiritual barrier. I’m afraid that it has made them warier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded slightly and said, “The defense of this Eastern Sun City is beyond our expectation. What have you decided to do? If we’re going to launch an assault, how confident are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I thought about it earlier. Given the scale of this soul formation, we’ll need our Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion to continuously attack and suppress them if we are to launch an assault. However, given the soul tools in this soul formation, I’m afraid it will be able to last for quite some time. At the same time, it can even counterattack. We’ll definitely sustain some losses then. If we use our Fort Soul Engineer Legion at the same time, we might be able to take it down as quickly as possible. However, we’ll still sustain losses. If we go head-to-head with them, we’ll expose our abilities. News will then spread from Eastern Sun City.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “It’s best for us to avoid any losses. The power that we control is limited. If we can avoid any direct clashes, it’ll be the best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone nodded in agreement. They had a common agreement on this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s expertise in soul tool technology was unquestioned. As a result, there were a few large-scale soul tools among this soul formation that Huo Yuhao and He Caitou didn’t recognize. They didn’t have time right now to research them either. The last time they attacked the Sun Moon Empire’s soul formations, there were a few such soul tools around too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If these soul tools were lethal weapons, or if the linked soul tools in the soul formation had some kind of special use, Shrek Academy’s three soul engineer legions would likely suffer very heavy damage. This was certainly something they couldn’t afford to risk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had linked soul tools too, but each of the three soul engineer legions was differently equipped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion that Huo Yuhao controlled were equipped with linked soul tools that could only be used for attacking, but not defending. This was the same for the Fort Soul Engineer Legion. This was because the resources that would be drained were far too great. It was only by attacking that they could conserve a lot of resources. After all, these three soul engineer legions were only supported by the wealth of Shrek Academy. They had no choice but to sacrifice certain aspects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion was equipped with linked soul tools that could attack and defend at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect’s greatest problem was that it couldn’t afford to sustain heavy losses. This was why they were afraid of being subjected to an all-out linked attack. The offensive strength of such an attack was even too overwhelming for a Titled Douluo. Losses and damages were certainly unavoidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “This is why I’ve decided not to use the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion after weighing our options. While the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion is offensively strong, it’s not flexible enough. Against a huge city like Eastern Sun City, we need to be able to retreat anytime we want to. For this soul formation, we need to think of a way of overcoming it from the inside. It’s only in this way that we can minimize our losses and gain the most from it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I agree.” He Caitou said without any hesitation. He was excited to have robbed a soul formation the other time. Every soul formation represented immense wealth! It was definitely good to loot a soul formation. Destruction would be a pity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei asked, “Yuhao, are you saying that we’re going to stick with attacking from the inside?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “A soul formation is very strong. Whether it’s in terms of defense or offense, it can achieve the best effect through linked soul tools. However, it has a flaw. It’s that any linked soul tools that are fired using a soul formation are all targeted outward. To overcome this flaw, many aerial surveillance soul tools have to be installed around the soul formation to keep enemies from getting close. My strength is that I can conceal myself and get close to the inside of such a soul formation, which would give me an opportunity to cause some destruction. Unless the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions can link together to attack and defend, I should be able to make a breakthrough using such a method.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The reason why this soul formation is so troublesome is because it has many spiritual detection soul tools and barriers. That’s why even I run the risk of alarming them if I sneak in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve made some estimates. The largest spiritual barrier in this soul formation is around five hundred meters from the formation. That’s also the maximum range of a spiritual barrier. Its greatest use is to prevent those who are adept at spiritual power from sneaking in. It doesn’t work the same as aerial surveillance soul tools.”</span></p>
