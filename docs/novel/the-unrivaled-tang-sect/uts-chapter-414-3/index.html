 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

The chilly air within the clouds was slowly and continuously being sucked in by the Ice Grass. Patches of clouds around started to rise, and the concentrated origin energy of heaven and earth started to surge towards Huo Yuhao, with the Ice Grass as its center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The origin energy that was sucked into the Ice Grass was filtered and started to pass into Huo Yuhao’s body and quickly replenished his soul power, which had been depleted in his rush to Clear Sky Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This origin energy wasn’t very domineering but was instead very gentle and pure. After entering his body, it immediately fused with his Mysterious Heaven Technique and became inseparable. It seemed as if Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was being nourished by the origin energy of heaven and earth. Huo Yuhao was a little stunned as he looked at his Ice Grass and said softly, “Thanks, Star Anise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass had given him a total of four soul skills. Two came from the soul bone, and two were added to the sixth soul ring of his Ice Empress. Right now, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was not demonstrating any of these four soul skills. Rather, he had already fused with Huo Yuhao’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More accurately speaking, the soul skill that the Ice Grass was unleashing right now seemed to belong to Huo Yuhao’s seventh soul ring. It was just that Huo Yuhao couldn’t use this soul skill on his own. His seventh soul ring was his Martial Soul True Body, but the Ice Grass could control it alone and unleashed this soul skill to help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an auxiliary-type soul skill that helped him absorb the origin energy of heaven and earth, which was something plant-type soul beasts were very adept at. Furthermore, the Ice Grass even churned the origin energy of heaven and earth around during this absorption process and broke the Clear Sky Sect’s mountain-guarding formation. In terms of fighting strength, plant-type soul beasts were inferior to animal-type soul beasts. However, plants had a deeper mastery of the principles of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh?” the earlier voice exclaimed slightly. Following this, Huo Yuhao saw several disciples in the Clear Sky Sect’s uniform block the path in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The road to the top of the Clear Sky Peak was precipitous. People had to use their hands and legs in order to reach the top. Right now, these disciples stuck close to the walls and looked very unfriendly as they looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Guys, I’m only here to see Dong’er. I have no ill-intentions.” Huo Yuhao said sincerely after putting the Ice Grass away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A middle-aged man who was around thirty years old said, “Go back. I said earlier that the Clear Sky Sect doesn’t welcome you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. “I only want to see Dong’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please return.” The burly middle-aged man from the Clear Sky Sect glared, and a strong aura was released from his body. Two yellow, three purple, and three black soul rings rose from his body. He was a Soul Sage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other six soul masters also released their soul rings. They were all five-ringed Soul Kings, and they all held a pitch-black hammer in their hands. These hammers were called Clear Sky Hammers, the powerful tool soul of the Clear Sky Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had almost never seen Wang Dong’er use her Clear Sky Hammer before. However, Wang Dong’er had twin martial souls. Her Clear Sky Hammer was her second martial soul, and thus she didn’t use it very often. She mostly used her Radiant Butterfly Goddess to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned as he faced the strong aura released by these seven Clear Sky Hammers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave now. If you don’t, don’t blame us for chasing you away,” the burly man snorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I can’t leave. I’m here to see Dong’er. I won’t leave before I see her. Guys, please give way to me.” The amiable look on his face also retracted. He didn’t know whether these disciples were acting of their own accord, or if they were instructed by their sect leaders. However, Wang Dong’er must not be in good condition if they were trying to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, who was normally very calm, would start to get emotional whenever something concerned Wang Dong’er. His eyes shone with purplish-gold light, and seven soul rings rose from his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone from the Clear Sky Sect saw the color of his soul rings, their expressions changed slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The colors of his soul rings aren’t what a normal soul master is supposed to have! What kind of power does this person possess?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao repeated, “Guys, please give way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Attack!” the burly man shouted and lifted his Clear Sky Hammer. His first and third soul rings shone brightly. His Clear Sky Hammer rapidly increased in size as he lifted it up, and instantly turned into a huge hammer more than ten meters in length. The cross-section of the hammer’s head was already more than two meters in diameter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge hammer was lifted up, then crashed down on Huo Yuhao with a terrifying aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold look surfaced on Huo Yuhao’s face. He didn’t dodge the attack. Instead, he lifted his right hand to punch this hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without using any soul skills, Huo Yuhao actually used his own fist to resist the powerful Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A loud boom echoed across the entire Clear Sky Peak. Not far away, a huge drift of snow suddenly slid down, causing snowflakes to scatter into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The six Clear Sky Sect disciples who were charging down stopped for a moment. The shock from that sound affected them quite badly. All of them were affected as they glared at Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao’s legs had sunk slightly into the ground. However, the Clear Sky Hammer that had hammered down on him was instantly deflected away. The burly man’s legs were slightly unstable, and he almost fell off the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What strength is this? He used his fist to resist a Clear Sky Hammer? How is this possible?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the Clear Sky Sect’s disciples couldn’t believe their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was that even a human’s hand?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s right hand had turned jade-green, and there was even a golden glow on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of the Beast God Di Tian, he was so small and weak that he couldn’t do anything. However, how could he lose against opponents that were either at the same level or inferior to him in terms of cultivation? This was even true if his opponents came from the Clear Sky Sect, which was the number one tool soul sect on the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the strength of his Mysterious Jade Hands and the Golden Dragon, Huo Yuhao could compare to Wang Qiu’er. This was the legacy of the Emperor Beast!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He forced the burly man’s Clear Sky Hammer away with his fist, and his eyes shone with a bright light. The surrounding air distorted strangely. In the eyes of all the Clear Sky Sect’s disciples and that burly man, everything in front of them had turned illusory. Fog seemed to appear again, but it wasn’t the cloudy fog that they were familiar with. Huo Yuhao vanished into thin air, just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had no intention of fighting it out with these Clear Sky Sect disciples. He wanted to find Wang Dong’er!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He unleashed his Spiritual Interference Domain to confuse these disciples, whose spiritual power was far weaker than his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Trash!” a low-pitched, furious roar sounded out. Huo Yuhao was shocked, and his Spiritual Interference Domain lost its effect for a moment, revealing his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second sect leader of the Clear Sky Sect, Tai Tan, was standing on the path to Clear Sky Castle with his hands behind his back and looking down coldly at Huo Yuhao, who was trying to climb up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Uncle Tai Tan.” After seeing him, Huo Yuhao rushed forward a few steps and greeted him respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t call me uncle. I don’t have a nephew like you. Leave now. I won’t let you see Dong’er,” Tai Tan said coldly.</span></p>

Has she awoken?”</span></p>

You can’t even protect her. Why are you here?” Tai Tan said coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, Huo Yuhao knew that he couldn’t enter without Tai Tan’s permission.</span></p>

He was a Transcendent Douluo who possessed terrifying strength and suppression. His spiritual power couldn’t mend the gap between them no matter how strong it was. Moreover, he was here to see Dong’er. He wasn’t here to fight!</span></p>

I only want to see Dong’er. Please let me take a look at her.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao grit his teeth and kneeled down on one knee in front of Tai Tan.</span></p>

He snapped, “You are a fellow without any backbone. A man’s knee can only touch the ground for heaven, earth, and his parents. Don’t you have a kneecap? You are turning more and more into a good-for-nothing. How dare you demand to see Dong’er like that? Scram.”</span></p>

He said, “Uncle Tai Tan, what must I do before you’ll let me see her?”</span></p>

When you can defeat me, I’ll trust that you can protect her. If that happens, I’ll let you see her.”</span></p>

It was like he couldn’t be bothered to talk to Huo Yuhao anymore.</span></p>

However, he still lowered his head.</span></p>

Do you think you can defeat me now? Are you trying to challenge me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “No, I know there’s a huge gap between us.”</span></p>

The purplish-gold light in his eyes had already turned rose-gold. His Eye of Destiny also slowly opened.</span></p>

It wasn’t an easy thing for him to come here, but he was being stopped by Tai Tan. He finally couldn’t remain composed anymore. Right now, there was only Wang Dong’er in his mind. He could finally see her if he defeated Tai Tan.</span></p>

If he didn’t vent, he felt that he might go crazy because he missed Wang Dong’er too much. Furthermore, Tai Tan had already stated his condition. If he didn’t try, how would he know how wide the gap between them was?</span></p>
