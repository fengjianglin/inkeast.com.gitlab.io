 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had a headache. If he hadn’t needed Wang Qiu’er’s ferocious strength, he really wouldn’t have brought her today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m in charge of close-combat abilities, while she controls all the other energy-based attacks and the other auxiliary abilities,” Wang Qiu’er’s voice rang out once more, and she explained the situation properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thought appeared in Huo Yuhao’s head. “If you two can coordinate so well, isn’t that a lot better than a single person controlling your fusion skill? But, aren’t fusion skills typically controlled by only one party? How can you two…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er snapped, “Is this the right time to delve into this? Let’s get down to business. We’ve absorbed that Soul Sage’s strength, and we can temporarily maintain this state!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she spoke, the Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation’s incredibly beautiful figure picked up the Life Guardian Blade that had dropped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second floor was a lot smaller than the first floor. It had about a third of the first floor’s surface area, but just this one-third could still be considered extremely spacious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There weren’t that many trunks and cases here, and only now could Huo Yuhao divert his attention to examining them. He had been focused on the various traps and mechanisms when his spiritual avatar followed Li Chong into this place, so it was only now that he truly felt how wealthy the Sun Moon Empire was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were more than thirty different types of rare metals stored on the second floor. Furthermore, these rare metals were very expensive and quite valuable. Every single type was exponentially more expensive than the ones they had seen on the first floor, and this was especially so for the seven or eight rare metals that were stored deeper inside. There were at least five different kinds that Huo Yuhao had heard of, but never seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These rare metals were a lot smaller in volume, but that was just relative. Their mass had to be calculated in tons, at the very least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rare metals in this warehouse couldn’t be gauged with money!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual undulations rippled vigorously and immediately informed the three girls about the traps and mechanisms on this floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are we going to take everything here and leave, or are we pushing forward?” Xiao Xiao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered, “We’ll do it this way – Xiao Xiao, you can start packing things into our storage-type soul tools according to my instructions. We will only choose the expensive ones, not the ones we need. Just take whatever’s valuable, and we can trade them with the Douluo Continent’s three native empires for other metals if the need arises. Dong’er, Qiu’er; you two will go directly to the third gate, and we will open the third gate with my Life Guardian Blade. We don’t have to go inside, but we absolutely need to see what’s stored inside. If we can’t take it away, we have to consider destroying whatever’s inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay!” The three girls acknowledged at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao directed the merged Wang Qiu’er and Wang Dong’er and pushed forward. They quickly arrived at the gate to the third floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had his Spiritual Detection activated this entire time, and even though the golden being wasn’t in its combat state, he could still see a lot of things with his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">First, he could feel its flourishing blood essence. Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon’s strength and blood worked perfectly on their Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation. Second, he could feel its flourishing energy of light that came from Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two girls’ auras were almost equal to one another in their Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation, and neither party possessed any conspicuous advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their speed and soul power had been amplified manifold, and gauging their strength at the pinnacle of what a Soul Sage could reach was a conservative estimate. Huo Yuhao even suspected that their current state could, in some sense, be considered a Martial Soul True Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Life Guardian Blade swiftly pierced through the metal gate. This time, stronger soul power was used to operate it, and thus the Life Guardian Blade’s Adjudication was channeled even more powerfully than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Spear was also having a good time – it absorbed voluminous amounts of metallic life energy to boost itself, and this Divine Weapon’s aura quickly became lot more intimidating and ferocious than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Spear had pierced right through a seven-ringed Soul Sage’s Invincible Barrier under the Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation’s control, but it could do that mainly because of the metallic energies that were temporarily stored within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Spear’s forte was penetration and piercing. The spear had also been amplified by tremendous metallic energies, and that made it a lot better at what it did best. The penetration point’s attacking strength temporarily reached an eight-ringed Soul Douluo’s level. In other words, Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er had temporarily become an eight-ringed Soul Douluo with a Divine Weapon in their possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Dragon Spear was temporarily bearing the power of Adjudication, and it converted this Adjudication into destructiveness towards living beings. The Invincible Barrier was energy-based, but it was targeted by two Divine Weapons at the same time, which greatly weakened it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Xiao Xiao was no longer polite and courteous. Actually, even Huo Yuhao was now showing some avarice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mine, they’re all mine!”</span></p>

He would probably be drooling at this moment if he actually had any saliva.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Any other soul engineer would feel the same way if they were in his shoes. In fact, they would probably be in a worse state than Huo Yuhao was right now.</span></p>

And that Soulforging Silver is also ours! Great stuff! Scarletsun Soulstunning Steel, fantastic! Pack as much as you can. Eh, what’s this? Golden Cloud? These things can be considered too luxurious even if they’re used to craft Class 9 soul tools. Why do they have so little of that? They don’t even have one ton of this? Take everything away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao became a porter under Huo Yuhao’s command. However, her labor was quite easy and relaxing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Storage-type soul tools had become a lot more convenient after so many years of development. The user only had to press them onto the items and infuse some soul power for the item to be absorbed inside the storage-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had also taken an enormous Starlight Sapphire storage-type soul tool that resembled a breastplate from the Illustrious Virtue Hall some years ago. It was a lot better than the vast majority of other storage-type soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The breastplate itself could contain more than all their other storage-type soul tools combined. When Huo Yuhao had first acquired it, there was still a lot of space left even when there was a giant human-shaped soul tool over ten meters tall inside. Other attachments could be also added to the breastplate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This thing could absorb all tangible things within five meters at once when soul power was infused into it. One sweep cleared out an entire patch of this floor of the warehouse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao was still very rational and conscious even though he was overcome by greed, and he reminded Xiao Xiao time and time again to avoid the booby traps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most successful part of their break-in was that they didn’t trigger any alarms.

The guards who had left had taken the keys to the second and third floor with them, and they didn’t consider the possibility that somebody could break in at all. Anybody who tried to attack the tough gates with brute force would immediately trigger the alarms.</span></p>

Thus, they picked the most valuable and densest rare metals.</span></p>

The Starlight Sapphire’s radiance was a little dimmer than before; it had been used too much.</span></p>

The first thing he noticed was that the gate to the third floor was now open.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao arrived before their Golden Butterfly Dragon in a flash of thought.</span></p>

However, his eyes grew slack as he gazed into the third warehouse.</span></p>

This staircase went down for twenty meters, and this was the reason why Huo Yuhao hadn’t seen exactly what was happening when he reached out with his Spiritual Detection after he heard Wang Dong’er’s exclamation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light was dim on the third floor at this moment, and there were several weak soul lamps dotting its walls. A dense metallic aura wafted from within, and it felt extremely eerie and chilly.</span></p>

The third floor should be smaller than the second floor, and he expected to see some kind of precious treasure, or perhaps some top-tier soul tools. That was why he wanted to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, he had already made up his mind. Even if they found something good on the third floor, they had to do as much as they could to destroy it. He couldn’t risk the three girls entering to retrieve the things inside, as he didn’t know what the defense mechanisms and firewalls were like.</span></p>

It might be ten times larger than the first floor!</span></p>

Otherwise, how could he feel as if this floor was endless even though he was standing at a high vantage point?</span></p>

The first things that entered his field of view were lines of soul cannons…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were enormous Class 4 soul cannons in the first row. These soul cannons fired very quickly, and were very precise, able to reach more than five hundred meters away. However, they were quite large, which meant they had wheels, and somebody had to push or pull them around. A Class 4 soul engineer without any Milk Bottles could fire more than thirty rounds from one continuously. &nbsp;</span></p>

Furthermore, he was looking at the weakest ones!</span></p>

He saw endless soul ray guns and small-scale soul cannons... and they were all Class 4 or Class 5 soul tools!</span></p>

What did this thing do? Sealed Milk Bottles allowed normal soldiers who weren’t soul engineers to carry soul tools into war. There weren’t that many of them, but there were at least thousands stored in this place. It wasn’t hard to guess that the Illustrious Virtue Hall had started manufacturing them en masse as soon as they had devised this technology!</span></p>

However, there were so many of them, and if they were equipped by the military…</span></p>

Their equipment couldn’t be compared to the soul tools in this place; they were probably two classes below what was here.</span></p>

There were also at least one hundred simplified all-terrain self-driving forts in this place!</span></p>
