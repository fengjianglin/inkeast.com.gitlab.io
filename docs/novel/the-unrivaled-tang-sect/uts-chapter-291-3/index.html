The flames froze in midair for an instant before they instantly transformed into an enormous fireball that contorted and undulated with wave-like patterns before arriving before Wang Dong’er in an eyeblink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every single person in the audience held their breath. The gigantic fireball had swelled to the point where it was almost half again as large as Wang Dong’er’s body. Could she take the hit? Was she about to be consumed by the fireball?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had a very intuitive judgment about beauty. Even though Shi Xing was representing the Sun Moon Empire, Wang Dong’er’s “handsomeness” and her good looks gave her quite a number of supporters. Many people subconsciously closed their eyes, as they couldn’t bear to see such a handsome youth perish just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only those who kept their eyes open witnessed something that was nothing short of a miracle. Wang Dong’er had no intention of evading the enormous ball of flame. Instead, she opened her arms, and her entire body seemed to transform into transparent golden water crystals in that moment. Her fifth soul ring lit up at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tremendous Scarletflame cannon shell had already arrived. However, Wang Dong’er’s body was instantly covered by a golden ripple, and she burst with light that seemed like a reflection from the water crystals that enveloped the cannon shell in front of her. The cannon shell’s forward momentum was slowed, and Wang Dong’er actually opened her arms just like that and wrapped them around the huge cannon shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, she hugged it. Furthermore, the incredibly unstable and reactive cannon shell didn’t explode at all…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…” Even Xu Tianran gasped involuntarily from the rostrum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s eyes had become completely golden by now. There was a tinge of mockery in her eyes as she stared at the young man opposite her. “I’m giving it back to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er raised her hands up into the sky and passed the cannon shell onto her right hand. The cannon shell shone with even more intense light as she raised it high into the air, and the scarlet-red flames were converted into brilliant golden fire. In the next moment, the cannon shell left a blazing and dazzling trail as it hurtled back towards Shi Xing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er muttered under her breath as she tossed the enormous cannon shell through the air, “How can you be willing to show me your trump card if I don’t give you enough time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden colors on her body receded as she threw the huge cannon shell away. Her wings opened behind her, and she chased after the cannon shell towards Shi Xing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing was completely rooted to the spot. A million possible outcomes had surfaced in his mind when he fired off his heavy cannon, and the worst possible outcome was that Wang Dong’er had an Invincible Barrier to defend herself against this strike. But even so, he would still have time to continue attacking, and using an Invincible Barrier also consumed soul power. Furthermore, this was equivalent to him erasing one of his opponent’s trump cards... but never in his wildest dreams did he expect the attack that he had charged for so long to come back towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden cannon shell was whistling through the air towards him, and it wasn’t any slower than before. Shi Xing immediately recovered as he slapped himself on the chest while he gritted his teeth. A golden barrier instantly rose from his body and shielded his entire body within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person that unleashed an Invincible Barrier wasn’t Wang Dong’er, it was him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A frightening explosion echoed through the sky, a golden flower blooming with riveting and bedazzling beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing was at the center of this explosion, and he could feel that his soul power was being consumed at an excessively alarming rate. An Invincible Barrier could only be used once, and it began to make crackling noises, as if it couldn’t withstand the terrifying explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took him immense effort before the explosion’s aftershocks finally disappeared. However, his soul power had diminished to less than fifty percent because of this, along with the soul tools he had used before this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What made Shi Xing even more terrified was the fact that Wang Dong’er had completely vanished from his field of view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Above you, fool!” Xiao Hongchen raged from the sidelines. It was a pity that Shi Xing couldn’t hear him at all from within the competition stage’s protective barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An enormous golden hexagram hovered above Shi Xing’s head. Just as his eyes were darting around fearfully, a large golden beam descended from the sky and swallowed his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing’s Class 5 protective soul barrier that he used to protect his body was immediately triggered, but nobody could see him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er dove from high above the sky as she extended her wings, and a golden sphere quickly condensed and took form in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing’s protective soul barrier was ripped to pieces, and another Invincible Barrier rose from his body. However, Shi Xing had less than thirty percent of his soul power left, and he could do little more than watch as another brilliant golden sphere slammed against his second Invincible Barrier. Sharp and shrill sounds could be heard as uncountable golden sparks erupted into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing’s soul power rapidly dwindled, and his eyes were full of despair by now. Wang Dong’er was still very close by, and her wings were fully extended as she descended from the sky like the Goddess of Light. He knew that he had been defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I admit defeat!” Shi Xing shouted as loud as he could. He had learned of the Tang Sect’s identity from Xiao Hongchen long before this, and knew both parties were mortal enemies. He didn’t want to lose his life here because of any unwarranted stubbornness. Furthermore, there was still a group battle after this, and this wasn’t the time for him to give everything he could. He was the first to fight, so all he had to do was use Milk Bottles to recover his soul power, and he would be back in peak condition when it was time for the group battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing felt as if he had lost this battle way too unconvincingly, and because he didn’t know anything about Wang Dong’er’s insidious fifth soul skill. He still didn’t know exactly what Wang Dong’er’s soul skill had done even now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s eyes flowed with mockery when she heard him admit defeat, the judge beneath her already hollering at her to stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er extended her arms to signal that she wasn’t attacking anymore. She withdrew her wings and slowly descended to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden sphere that she had released continued rubbing against Shi Xing’s Invincible Barrier, but the radiance was getting weaker and weaker. The Butterfly Goddess Slash originally had an area of effect, but she had focused it into a single point, giving it an incredible destructive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing heaved a sigh of relief as if a huge burden were lifted off his chest. The Invincible Barrier that he was using was the strongest possible type, and he looked on as her attack gradually grew weaker to the point where it could no longer hurt him. His Invincible Barrier was enough to hold on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er drifted to the ground and turned towards the judge. She said mockingly, “Don’t worry, I’m not attacking him anymore. However, if I had been the one that was at a disadvantage, would you have been so worried?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The judge shot a cold look at her and said, “Why don’t you try and find out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er raised her index finger and wiggled it at him. “You won’t get that chance. Can you declare that I have won this fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. The Tang Sect is victorious in the first single elimination match.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The judge hadn’t even finished his sentence when an agonizing howl echoed from the sky, and a body plummeted down in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The judge was still a Soul Sage after all, so his reactions were extremely quick. He immediately caught the body falling through the air in a flash of motion.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you killed him.” The judge turned back towards Wang Dong’er, infuriated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s expression seemed as innocent as ever. “Which eye of yours saw that I killed him? I came down in the same moment that he admitted defeat, and I have been by your side this entire time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first match was over, and the protective barriers around the competition stage naturally receded and disappeared. Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen leapt onto stage at almost the same time as they raced over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were also astounded when Shi Xing dropped from the sky for some unknown reason. They could clearly see that Wang Dong’er’s Butterfly Goddess Slash had disappeared before that. Did Shi Xing burn through every ounce of his soul power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they could immediately tell when they came near that Shi Xing’s circumstance wasn’t as simple as him exhausting all his soul power. The judge caught him before he hit the ground, and even if he didn’t have any soul power left, he would only be exhausted and fatigued. But he wasn’t breathing anymore at the moment, and he was as dead as he could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen roared furiously, “Wang Dong! You dare to kill my teammate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er wore the same innocent expression and replied, “I didn’t kill anyone. I have no idea why he’s dead. Are you blind?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen hesitated and said, “Brother, can it be that Shi Xing has some hidden problems? It’s true that Wang Dong didn’t do anything to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bam!” Xiao Hongchen spun around and slapped Meng Hongchen across the face. “Shut up! You’ve become so disloyal because of your infatuation. You’re still defending your opponents even at a time like this. Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen felt her heart skip a beat as she stared at Xiao Hongchen’s bloodshot eyes. She felt extremely aggrieved, but she didn’t dare to say anything more. Meng Hongchen lifted her head and glanced at Wang Dong’er, before tears welled up in her eyes, and she turned and ran away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen took Shi Xing’s body from the judge. He glared at Wang Dong’er and gritted his teeth. “I will not stop until I draw my last breath.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er smiled faintly and said, “Come, then. Are you up next? Or are you going to keep letting your teammates die?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen took a deep breath, and his outraged expression gradually calmed down. Instead, he said nothing more as he stepped off the stage with Shi Xing’s corpse in his arms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er took out a Milk Bottle as if she were demonstrating a magic trick, and she stood there quietly to replenish her soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er had won this battle. She had eliminated her opponent, to the point where he didn’t get to give everything that he had. It could be said that she had won this fight absolutely and perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ fifth soul skill – the Goddess of Light’s Possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er could transform herself into a light elemental form for three seconds, and this allowed her to develop an affinity for every other element except the darkness element. This soul skill amplified the force of her other soul skills by one hundred percent, and this also allowed her to strike back at darkness elements with three times the original force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er relied on the Goddess of Light’s Possession’s special characteristic of developing an affinity for other elements to control the enormous fire-type Scarletflame Cannon shell. She was then able to throw it back, and thus clinch her victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing’s death obviously had something to do with her. Her Butterfly Goddess Slash was discreetly charged up with the ability that her Broken Devil of Light right arm bone carried, the Devilbreaking Golden Light, which erupted only in the last second and directly pierced into Shi Xing’s heart. How could he survive an attack like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er had murdered one of the Sun Moon Empire’s main team members, which meant that she had undoubtedly greatly weakened the opposing team’s overall strength. This was extremely beneficial for the group battle that was to come afterwards, and towards Shrek Academy’s fight against the Sun Moon Empire after today.</span></p>
