 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After gaining his second soul core, Elder Xuan did not only find his abilities greatly enhanced, but also saw the true powerful effects of a second soul core. The enhancement did not just stop at the compression of soul power, but it also increased his potential to new heights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was thinking about the possibilities Huo Yuhao would unlock if he were to successfully form his third soul core when he became an Ultimate Douluo rank after perfecting his second soul core. When that happened, Huo Yuhao would truly become one of the most outstanding soul masters ever. At the same time, he would definitely be able to overcome the limits imposed by this world. Even if he were not able to inherit a Godly Seat, he should be freed from the restrictions at Rank 99 once he formed his third soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the day, all of the above were just guesses made by Elder Xuan. However, those guesses were what he hoped Huo Yuhao could achieve. Of course, he knew how hard forming the third soul core would be after experiencing the challenge of forming his second soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao, Yuhao! Do you really have to push yourself so hard to become stronger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was this really what Huo Yuhao had planned? No, it was not entirely true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Elder Xuan had accurately predicted, Huo Yuhao already had a complete plan. Improving himself was indeed one of the important parts of the plan. However, he did not intend to put his life on the line just to force some sort of breakthrough. Instead, he wanted to gain a better understanding of the new abilities he had just acquired by fighting in a life-and-death situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had already been a few days since he had formed his second soul core with the Yin Yang Complement technique. However, he still had not fully understood the capabilities of his second soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By forcing himself to fight with powerful cultivators, he would be able to understand the intricacies behind his second soul core as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the second being in the world to possess a second soul core formed from the Yin Yang Complement technique. The first being was the Beast God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Di Tian was able to take on human form, he was ultimately a soul beast. Huo Yuhao was indisputably the first human to form his second soul core with the Yin Yang Complement technique. Hence, no one could teach him how to use his second soul core, or how powerful his second soul core actually was. Hence, he had to explore all of these by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao had enough time, he would definitely have chosen to explore its capabilities in a more rigorous and slower manner. That would be the ideal way to prepare himself to take on the challenge to become a God in the future. However, time was definitely a luxury for him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he had no choice but to agitate his body with battles to see what capabilities he now possessed after forming his second soul core. It was the fastest way for him to accurately determine how much power he possessed. The greater the adversity, the more potential he could try to squeeze from his body. This was something he had learned when he had first participated in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to back then, his powers and abilities had grown exponentially. However, Huo Yuhao still believed that putting oneself under immense pressure was the best way to learn more about one’s abilities regardless of one’s current standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, two hours passed, and it was almost time for the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Neat contingents of troops started to move out from the Sun Moon Empire camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were not many people who left their military camp. There were less than a thousand people in total. However, all of them were soul engineers who were fully armed. They had activated their linked defensive barriers as they started to head towards Huo Yuhao, who was roughly twenty-two kilometers away from them. These contingents were surrounding a group of powerful individuals from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City also opened their gates. Even though Huo Yuhao had seemed to cut off his connections with the Academy, Elder Xuan had his own reasons for dispatching some of his forces. After all, it was not possible for the Academy to sit and wait as the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineers advanced closer to the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City seemed to have only sent soul masters into the air. In fact, they sent more than a thousand soul masters who were all at least Soul Sages into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ones who were flying at the front of this contingent were the Elders of the Sea God’s Pavilion and the elite cultivators from the three empires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of them held any bad feelings towards Huo Yuhao, because they could not even hear what he had said to the Sun Moon Empire army! Elder Xuan only informed them of how Huo Yuhao had planned to take on ten different individuals to solve their current predicament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a hero in everyone’s eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The way both parties sent out a force of close to a thousand individuals towards the battleground made it seem as though everything had been planned in advance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the battle was conducted in a one-on-one fashion, the Sun Moon Empire would have no chance of beating Shrek Academy even if they were to double the number of people they had. However, this was ultimately war. In a battle which included soul engineers, concepts about one-on-one battles were non-existent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan brought his group of people to a position which was roughly five hundred meters from Huo Yuhao before stopping. He also did not allow anyone to go over and interact with him. All they did was line themselves up and watch the upcoming battle silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this crucial moment, Elder Xuan did not wish for anyone to disturb Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire troops also stopped five hundred meters away from Huo Yuhao. This meant that they were about a thousand meters away from Elder Xuan and the powerful cultivators of Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A distance of a single kilometer separated both parties. A battle, which would definitely go down in history as one of the most important battles in the world of soul masters, was about to take place in the space between these parties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was still looking brilliant as ever in her armor. After her subordinate brought a huge chair over, she sat down in the chair as she gazed at Huo Yuhao. As the Commander of the Three Armies, she was the only person here who was qualified to sit down. Even Zhongli Wu—the military supervisor—was not entitled to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu stared coldly at Huo Yuhao as a light flickered in his eyes. It was unclear what was on his mind. However, the aura he was radiating was becoming more and more intense by the minute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Huo Yuhao was still meditating, he could sense the series of transformations occurring around him. However, he chose to ignore all of these movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao, let the ten battles begin.” Zhongli Wu announced as his low but thunderous voice traveled towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only after hearing Zhongli Wu’s words that Huo Yuhao finally opened his eyes slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the instant when Huo Yuhao opened his eyes, Zhongli Wu felt his heart beat faster. He saw a mystical pair of eyes before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were differently colored. One of them was a brilliant gold. Even though it did not radiate a particularly bright light, it seemed to possess the endless depth of the sun. His other eye was flickering with an azure blue light. It seemed to embody the vastness of the big blue ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The different-colored lights in his eyes only lasted for a short while before they regained their original color. In fact, this entire transformation happened without him releasing any aura at all. However, this was sufficient to make the powerful individuals from the Sun Moon Empire wary of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Ju Zi had put it, courage was not enough to drive a person to challenge ten people to a battle. It was important to note that this was not the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. There was an age limit in the tournament, which usually helped to ensure that competitors were of similar ranks. However, this was a matter of life and death on the battlefield. No one would hesitate to send his or her strongest members to battle. Huo Yuhao was definitely going to be up against the most powerful individuals from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Death God Douluo, the Dragon Emperor Douluo, and the Sun Moon Empire’s most powerful soul engineers were not present, they still possessed top-class power which even the Shrek Academy had to be wary of!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao floated above the ground before standing up. Following which, he turned around to nod in Tang Wutong’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stared deeply into his eyes before stepping forward to hug him. She whispered something in his ear before walking back to where Elder Xuan and the rest were. However, she did not join them, as she chose to observe Huo Yuhao from a hundred meters in front of Elder Xuan and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at Zhongli Wu before looking at Ju Zi, who was sitting in her chair. He said, “Bring it on. Let’s start with the first one!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao mentioned how he was ready to begin with the first one, Ju Zi could not help but think of the time she had spent with Huo Yuhao at the Sun Moon Empire’s Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. It was then that Huo Yuhao had once challenged the powerful students of the Academy. Back then, he also did not cower as he used his power and abilities to go up against those students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was him—a powerful individual with heroic qualities, but also a soft heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More than ten years had passed, and he had grown to become one of the most powerful soul masters in the entire world. If he were able to win today’s battle, he would undoubtedly become one of the Sun Moon Empire’s biggest threats in the future. He would also naturally become a beacon of hope for the three other empires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was destined to be a battle in which Huo Yuhao would truly become famous. Even if he were to die, he would still be a hero of the three original empires of the Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was overwhelmed by a multitude of feelings as she kept quiet. It seemed as though she had handed the entire battle over to Zhongli Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu let out a cold grunt as he waved his hand. A black figure launched himself forward towards Huo Yuhao from Zhongli Wu’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a person who was wrapped tightly in his black cloak. There was no way one could see his appearance at all. He was like a cloud of black fog when he flew towards Huo Yuhao. His aura was rapidly becoming stronger. The power of darkness within his aura was brimming with evil vibes as it exploded like a geyser.

They seemed to be swarming towards Huo Yuhao as they threatened to block all sunlight from reaching him.</span></p>

Even though he was not one of the eight Elders within the Holy Ghost Church, he was one of the most powerful soul masters within the Holy Ghost Church’s Hall of Consecration.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had been mistaken by others as an evil soul master and was, in fact, being hunted down by others because of his dark-type martial soul. In a fit of anger, he killed all the people who were going after him and chose to join the Holy Ghost Church. After several years of cultivation, he finally became a true evil soul master.</span></p>
