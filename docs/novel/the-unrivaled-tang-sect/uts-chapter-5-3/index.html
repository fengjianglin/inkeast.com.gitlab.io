 <p><strong>Book 1: Skydream Iceworm</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 5.3: First Glimpse Through&nbsp;The Gate</strong></p>
 <p>By the time that Huo Yuhao had just started to guide his soulforce around his body, Bei Bei’s expression had turned serious. Huo Yuhao’s comprehension skills were very high, and he was also very smart. However, his body’s talents were indeed somewhat lacking. After Bei Bei’s soulforce had entered Huo Yuhao’s body, he discovered that his meridians were extremely narrow, and that there were some very delicate meridians in his body that wouldn’t be able to handle any strong force flowing through.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Bei Bei realised that the fact that Huo Yuhao had been able to cultivate to his current rank, and that he had been able possess his first soul ring, had been somewhat difficult for him. After obtaining his first soul ring, his body would’ve improved to a certain extent, but his passageways were still this frail. It could be seen just how poor his talent was, so much so that he truly wasn’t much better off than some ordinary folks who hadn’t even awakened their soulforce. Just how much willpower did he have to have to have cultivated his soulforce to the tenth rank and have become a Soul Master!</p>
 <p>Bei Bei had a calm temperament; discovering this didn’t make him feel despair towards Huo Yuhao. Instead, his respect for him slightly increased. Being able to have such unwavering determination at Huo Yuhao’s age meant that, even if Huo Yuhao’s talent was somewhat poor, he’d still be able to achieve something in life.</p>
 <p>After investigating the condition of Huo Yuhao body, Bei Bei guessed that the reason that Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes were so strong was definitely linked to the mutation of his martial soul. Furthermore, although his mutated martial soul was very strong, the harm it had caused to Huo Yuhao when he was young was also very great. Because he hadn’t been properly cared for, it caused his talent to become like this. If he’d been immediately treated with medicine after he was born, perhaps his junior brother would’ve been a genius.</p>
 <p>In reality, Bei Bei’s guess was only half-accurate. The reason why Huo Yuhao’s body was so frail was indeed because of the deficiency caused by the mutation of his martial soul, and because of the lack of care towards him after awakening his martial spirit. However, the main reason why his Spirit Eyes’ skills were so strong, was because of the million-year intelligent soul ring, the Skydream Iceworm.</p>
 <p>As the dark sky gradually turned dark blue, a patch of white slowly began to appear from the east. Bei Bei slowly withdrew his palms, and let out a long breath. It was hard to conceal the exhaustion on his slightly pale face.</p>
 <p>He’d used an entire night to help unblock Huo Yuhao’s passageways, helping him complete the first circulation of the Mysterious Heaven Technique. This process had been quite arduous, but it had had enormous benefits for Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>“Peh—” Huo Yuhao spat out a mouthful of clotted blood before he opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Huo Yuhao felt that all 36,000 pores on his body had been opened up, causing an unprecedented feeling of relaxation to spread throughout his body. The mouthful of clotted blood he’d spat out were impurities within his blood that had caused the stagnation of his passageways. After Bei Bei had helped him unblock his passageways, it finally unclogged his passageways. Even if his passageways were still thin and weak, he could at least let soulforce flow through them. This would allow Huo Yuhao’s soulforce to flow smoothly when he cultivated in the future. To a certain extent, this had changed his physique.</p>
 <p>Even though Bei Bei was an excellent cultivator amongst his peers, and was a Soul Elder level expert, he was exhausted after unblocking Huo Yuhao’s passageways.</p>
 <p>“Junior brother, stand up and look towards the east. Follow my movements, and focus your eyes.” Bei Bei resisted his exhaustion, and let out a low shout towards Huo Yuhao while grasping his shoulders with his hands.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tang Ya, who had originally been sleeping soundly, actually woke up. She jumped up and arrived beside Bei Bei.</p>
 <p>The three of them opened their eyes and looked towards the eastern sky. A faint purple cloud seemed to flash through the marble-white sky that was gradually turning bright. If you didn’t have astonishing visual acuity, as well as sufficient concentration, it would be impossible for one to discover its existence.</p>
 <p>The appearance of the purple cloud caused the three people’s attention to be focused on it. They even stopped exhaling. Instead, they lightly and slowly inhaled, simultaneously fixing their gazes on the hint of purple that had suddenly, faintly appeared.</p>
 <p>The purple cloud wasn’t present for very long. By the time the morning sun had slowly risen from the east, it had already disappeared.</p>
 <p>Only then did the three people slowly close their eyes, and simultaneously exhale the impurities from their bodies.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei and Tang Ya each spat out a misty white stream of air. After inhaling and exhaling several times, it finally dispersed.</p>
 <p>Although Huo Yuhao’s cultivation wasn’t even close to that of his Teacher Xiao Ya, or his eldest senior brother, he felt an intense shock.</p>
 <p>When he had looked at the purple cloud in the distant east, a strong warm feeling had seemed to flow into his brain via his Spirit Eyes, causing his eyes to obtain an unprecedented nourishment; so much so that he was able to look at anything with an extremely clear level of vision without using any soulforce. Even his peripheral vision instantly expanded.</p>
 <p>And when he had shut his eyes to contain that purple cloud, it had slowly immersed itself into his eyes. His Spirit Eyes had even started to naturally activate the soulforce within his body, causing it to merge with the purple cloud. The originally warm feeling gradually became a faint refreshing feeling that gave him an unspeakable sense of relaxation.</p>
 <p>The Purple Demon Eyes, this was the skill that Teacher Xiao Ya had spoken about. This was the skill that was said to be the most suitable for him to cultivate! This was only the first time that he’d cultivated it, yet it unexpectedly had had such an effect. Huo Yuhao felt that even the soulforce that he’d previously cultivated and upgraded for the past several months hadn’t had as good an effect as this eastern purple cloud.</p>
 <p>After a full 15 minutes, that feeling of relaxation gradually disappeared. When Huo Yuhao finally opened his eyes, a faintly discernible purple light had already appeared in the depths of his clear, deep blue eyes.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you truly had good results!” Tang Ya looked at Huo Yuhao with a pleased expression on her face.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hurriedly stood up and respectfully said, “Thank you, teacher. Thank you, eldest senior brother.”</p>
 <p>The purple glint in Bei Bei’s eyes gradually dimmed, but a look of extreme exhaustion still remained on his face. He patted Huo Yuhao’s shoulder as he said, “We’re a family. In the future, you don’t need to thank us. However, I’m going to rest for a while, so I’m afraid that we can only leave later. Teacher Xiao Ya, please prepare some food. Junior brother, go cultivate the Mysterious Heaven Technique again to consolidate your memories from last night.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” The respect that Huo Yuhao had towards this eldest senior brother of his had deepened even more. After hearing his words, he immediately sat down and began to follow the Mysterious Heaven Technique to circulate his soulforce.</p>
 <p>With the profound memories of last night, along with Bei Bei unclogging his meridians, activating his soulforce was now much easier. The soulforce that he’d originally obtained via meditation gradually turned a faint white colour after being refined by the Mysterious Heaven Technique.</p>
 <p>After two hours, Bei Bei took the initiative to awaken from his cultivation. His cultivation level was already extremely strong, so he could easily sweep away his exhaustion.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya gave Bei Bei some rations and quietly asked, “How is he?”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei smiled slightly and said, “You were actually right this time. My junior brother is a promising talent. His body’s condition isn’t great, but he has strong comprehensive abilities. Furthermore, he can bear hardship, and his heart is steady. He’s a good sprout. In addition to that, the Mysterious Heaven Technique in and of itself has benefits towards his growth. If he cultivates it for a long time, it’ll help repair the passageways in his body. This is a technique that’s also quite suitable for him. As for his future growth, it’ll depend on his own hard work, as well as what opportunities he obtains. All we can do is open a door for him, but how far he can travel will be up to him.”</p>
