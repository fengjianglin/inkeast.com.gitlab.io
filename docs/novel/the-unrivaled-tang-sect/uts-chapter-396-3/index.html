 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

I heard Elder Nan Shuishui mention that Huo Yuhao had some important matters to attend to. He will return after he settles them. He should be able to guess that the soul beasts from the Great Star Dou Forest are going to retaliate. Considering his intelligence, I’m sure he’ll rush back as soon as possible, even though he’s affected by Qiu’er’s death. I believe that he has some kind of way to help us deal with this beast wave. Dean Yan, the Tang Sect can’t shirk responsibility for this matter. We are willing to use whatever strength we have to help the Academy resist this beast wave. I just hope that you can put in a few good words for us to Elder Xuan. This wasn’t what Huo Yuhao wished for. He has also been greatly affected, and he was also the passive one, too. This…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe suddenly raised his hand to interrupt Bei Bei, stopping him from continuing further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the point of saying all that now? Let’s force this beast wave back first. Furthermore, did I say that I’m blaming Yuhao? This can only be considered an opportunity for him! Why would we blame him for something like this? He’s already very blessed, and he’s now obtained the strength of the god beast of Destiny! He’s bound to grow even faster! We still can’t tell whether this is a good thing or a bad thing for the Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s wait until he’s back. In addition, do you really think Di Tian would remain quiet, even without this thing as a trigger? The abilities of the soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest have been increasing significantly over these past few centuries. The number of hundred-thousand-year soul beasts has been increasing, and their overall abilities have reached a new high. The Golden Eyes Black Dragon King is a rogue. In fact, the Academy had already guessed that he wouldn’t choose to remain quiet for long!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The death of the Emperor Beast has only accelerated this process. The death of the Emperor Beast has also greatly restricted any future enhancements to the Great Star Dou Forest. This is not a bad thing for humans! Right now, let’s see how we deal with this crisis.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei was much more relieved after listening to Yan Shaozhe’s words. Dean Yan’s attitude basically represented that of the Academy. As long as they didn’t blame Huo Yuhao for bringing about this calamity, Bei Bei was satisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei straightened his gaze and asked, “Dean Yan, what do you need us to do now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe replied, “I don’t need all of you to fight yet. Didn’t you say that you wanted to gather the Tang Sect’s strength to help the Academy? In that case, I’ll need you and your sect to bring out all the soul tools you have. The Tang Sect will be in charge of the deployment of its soul tools. Coordinate with Shi Xing regarding this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Bei Bei quickly agreed, and immediately turned around before gesturing to his comrades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi and the others had also heard what had happened to Huo Yuhao. They were also very worried about the Academy’s opinion. Right now, they felt more relieved after seeing Bei Bei’s expression. From Bei Bei’s face, it seemed like the Academy didn’t have any opinion on Huo Yuhao just yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go and gather all the soul tools in the sect. Take out all our Sealed Milk Bottles and the various soul tools that we’ve just invented,” Bei Bei instructed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was important to Shrek Academy, but he was also equally important to the Tang Sect. He was everyone’s little junior, and had contributed greatly to the development of the sect. At this critical moment, Bei Bei only wanted to do one thing as the eldest senior of the Tang Sect: contribute as much as he and the Tang Sect could to stop this beast wave, and make amends for Huo Yuhao’s mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle had well and truly begun. The soul beast army didn’t stop their attack even though they had suffered heavy casualties. On the contrary, their attacks became even more ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Xing was holding the fort at the center of the southern city wall, issuing orders continuously. After firing the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons again, he had no choice but to let the cannons cool down for some time. Huge numbers of soul beasts started to scale the city walls again, and the long-range attacks that came from the soul beasts had also become stronger. Shi Xing immediately changed their fighting strategy in response to all this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Activate our protective soul barriers and release the shock bombs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul masters who were the furthest back were each carrying a metal pole in front of them. They quickly pressed their palms against their poles and poured in their soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a green barrier quickly rose over Shrek City, forming a strong isolation barrier. The soul beasts that were about to reach the top of the city walls suddenly realized that they weren’t able to grab hold of anything with their sharp claws, and immediately slid back down the walls. The long-range attacks that hit the barrier were immediately dispelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A hole suddenly opened at an inconspicuous spot on the south city wall. Balls of silver light instantly spread out from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense shockwaves started to surge outwards, and all the soul beasts that were climbing the city walls were engulfed in a net formed by these balls of silver light. Their bodies started to shine with silver light as they fell off the city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Falling off the city wall wasn’t fatal for these soul beasts, considering how tough their bodies were. The shockwaves only temporarily stopped them, too. However, they crashed into the soul beasts underneath them as they fell off the city walls. The pulse that came from the shock bombs could be passed on. Suddenly, a huge number of soul beasts beneath the city started to gather together, and they were all affected by the shock bombs, causing them to temporarily lose their offensive abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Throw!” Shi Xing’s shouted with an emotionless look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Balls of fire were then rapidly thrown into the air by ordinary soldiers. These fireballs weren’t ordinary, though. They were mixed with some medicine using special formulas to increase their combustion effect and viscosity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Incendiary bombs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were specially invented by Shrek Academy, and were only used for defending the city. Most importantly, they just needed to be ignited before use, and would explode the moment they contacted something else. After exploding, they would turn certain regions into seas of fire, and these fires would continue to burn for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most soul beasts were afraid of fire. Even though these flames weren’t enough to kill them, their instinctive fear would still cause them to panic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These incendiary bombs could also be used by ordinary soldiers. In an instant, countless Incendiary Bombs were thrown down from the city wall, creating a huge sea of fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul beasts that were gathered beneath the city wall started to roar wildly. They struggled in this sea of fire, and didn’t even care when they hurt other soul beasts. The rest of the soul beasts charging from behind couldn’t help but be deterred by the extremely high temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Shrek City wasn’t as large as Radiant City, and didn’t have a Soul Engineering Legion, they had the most outstanding soul masters in the entire continent, and possessed an army with the greatest fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Incendiary Bombs landed, Elder Song’s attacking intensity increased. While she was encircled by several hundred-thousand-year soul beasts, she still managed to pester Bi Ji enough that she was unable to use her area of effect healing-type soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These soul beasts’ long-range attacks weren’t weak, but it was a pity that there were too many types of soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest, and they hardly lived together as a species. Under such circumstances, they weren’t able to coordinate with one another. Even the long-range attacks by the hundred-thousand-year soul beasts weren’t able to cause too much damage to the protective soul barrier on the city wall, as they didn’t coordinate and strike at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy was still waiting, while adopting a strict formation. Their current advantage didn’t mean anything. The beast wave that was coming still seemed to be endless. Furthermore, the truly strong soul beasts from the Great Star Dou Forest had yet to enter the fight!</span></p>

No one from Shrek went to reinforce Elder Song, including the Martial God Douluo Xian Lin’er, who was Elder Song’s biological daughter. It was because no one could match her speed.</span></p>
