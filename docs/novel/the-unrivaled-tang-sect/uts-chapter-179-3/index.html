 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Otherwise, it’ll affect my fighting spirit. With these odds, we’ll only lose our profits if I eventually lose and they increase their wager, and… I might not lose. I’ll give it my all tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Xiaosheng’s lips twisted a little, and he laughed bitterly, “Talking to you two dampens my spirit. I won't talk to either of you anymore. Teacher Fan Yu, I’m leaving first! You’re just too ferocious today, but it’s not your… gosh!” Ye Xiaosheng was depressed, and he walked out with his hands on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and He Caitou couldn’t help but think of how he’d asked them to call him Brother Sheng as they left the academy. They grinned as that thought crossed their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu stood up and said, “Yuhao, take a quick break. I don’t have many instructions for you. Give it your best tomorrow, but safety comes first. You know how important you are to Shrek.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, teacher. I won’t be careless like before.” Huo Yuhao sat up straight on the bed and wanted to send them off. However, he was stopped by Fan Yu and He Caitou. After that, the two of them left on their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao forcefully dragged himself into a cross-legged sitting position. He couldn’t just sleep. Otherwise, his efforts for the day would be wasted. It was only through restoring his energy in a cultivation state could he really assimilate the insights he’d made during the sparring today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The doorbell suddenly rang. Because he was too tired, Huo Yuhao didn’t unleash his spiritual detection. He assumed that it was either Fan Yu or He Caitou, so he took in a deep breath, and walked to the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was neither of them. Rather, it was a familiar young lady with a well-proportioned figure. It was Na Na, the Soul King from the Active Control Soul Tool Department he had defeated today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you here?” Huo Yuhao furrowed his brows, but he wasn’t too wary of her. Part of Na Na’s spirit was under his control. If he wanted to, he could restrict her movements and easily harm her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na furrowed her brows and she said, “Can I come in?” Although she wasn’t that ravishing, her bravery gave her a sense of charm. This charm properly accentuated her well-proportioned figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao opened the door wide and gestured for her to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na entered the room, but Huo Yuhao didn’t close the door. It was late at night, and it wasn’t too appropriate for the two of them to be alone together in the same room, thus it was better for the door to be left ajar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s up?” Huo Yuhao was too tired, and went to take a seat on a chair off to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na retorted, “I should be the one asking you that! What did you do to my body? How did you control it?” She was filled with hatred as she demanded an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she lost to Huo Yuhao, this matter had been bothering her, but she only came to talk to him after the day’s competition was over. She didn’t approach him before as there were others with him, and came to his room after Fan Yu and He Caitou left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered indifferently, “I have no idea what you’re talking about. If there’s nothing else, please excuse yourself. I still need to spar tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na was enraged. “You don’t have the guts to admit it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s brows lifted and he said coldly, “What did I do? You’re the one who unleashed your Avenging Spirit and tried to kill me. It’s a joke that you’re going to interrogate me now. Please see yourself out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Na Na wanted to erupt, but she held it in. She bit her lips until they were red, “I can feel that my Avenging Spirit has been restrained by you. What will it take for you to return my spirit to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned by her sensitive judgement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na continued to say, “Don’t tell me it’s not your doing! If my spirit was dissipated or destroyed by you, I would’ve been critically injured. But I’m fine, except that my body is not under my control. You must’ve done something to my spirit. Return it to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed and answered, “Alright, even if I did, why should I return it to you? You almost killed me. What right do you have to comment on my actions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… I’ll report you to the academy!” Na Na was furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 28pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pointed towards the door, “Do what you want. But someone will have to believe you first, and even if someone believes your words, what evidence do you have? To soul masters, our spirit is a mystical thing. Even a Titled Douluo can’t claim to be completely familiarized with their spirit. Moreover, no one can prove that your spirit is with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na’s expression changed. When she saw Huo Yuhao’s calm look, she slowly walked to the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sniggered to himself. Since he was scared by her this morning, he had to make her pay for it. However, his heart still softened a little. He would return her spirit once the competition was over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na walked very slowly. But when she reached the door, she stopped in her tracks. She didn’t leave, and shut the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? What are you doing?” Huo Yuhao stood up from his seated position. Even though he was very tired, his soul power was still at peak condition. Furthermore, Na Na’s soul was still under his control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na turned around, with two streams of tears flowing down her cheeks. Her body shuddered slightly, then her entire figure seemed to become illusory. Her clothing slipped off her body, revealing her naked figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was flabbergasted. He absolutely didn’t expect her to do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Huo Yuhao was shocked as he looked at her. Her figure was flawless. All women craved a body like hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undoubtedly, Na Na was blessed in this area. There was no excess fat on her body, and her skin was extremely smooth and tender. Although her skin wasn’t snow-white, it had a healthy sense to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her slender waist was springy, and her flawless curves extended all the way down. She wasn’t facing Huo Yuhao directly, so he couldn’t see everything. But he could still see her perky buttocks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t stand looking any longer. At his age, one was supposed to be extremely curious but unclear about these matters of the heart. He had once sensed feminine beauty from Ma Xiaotao, but he was too young then. That was why he wasn’t as tempted. However, he had also developed in this aspect over the past two years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He panicked a lot and turned around, flustered. After that, he said, “Put your clothes on! What’re you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na was teary-eyed as she said, “I know that you’re an elite student from Shrek. I don’t have anything valuable to exchange for my spirit. I only have my body. I’ve never been touched by a man. If you promise to return my spirit, I’ll give my body to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I…” Huo Yuhao hadn’t expected something like this. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a little anxious as he said, “Put your clothes on and get out immediately. When the matches is over, I’ll return your spirit.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na was stunned for a moment, and only reacted after a while. Huo Yuhao seemed to be scared of her current self, and looked rather pathetic. He wasn’t nearly as arrogant as he was earlier under everyone’s gazes.</span></p>

In their eyes, Huo Yuhao was a powerful soul master. But now Na Na could remember that he was still just a fifteen-year-old youth. It seemed like she was reading too much into things.</span></p>

He felt his nose getting hot as if it were about to start bleeding. Furthermore, he didn’t dare to use his spiritual detection to tell whether she was done. After all, he would definitely still sense her body!</span></p>

He turned back to confirm that Na Na was indeed fully clothed, before turning his whole body around again. His face heated up, and his nose was just as hot as before. He tried to resist his nosebleed. But even though Huo Yuhao tried his best to cover his nosebleed, Na Na still managed to see it.</span></p>

He was still trying to expel the erotic scene from his mind.</span></p>

Why not now? Why must it be after the end of the competition?”</span></p>

Leave already.” Even he felt that his reply was a little incoherent.</span></p>

Anyway, I have nothing I can use to exchange for it aside from my body. If you back out and want my body again, just tell me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt his nose heating up even more, and there seemed to be blood flowing out of it this time.</span></p>

She smiled, “You don’t seem that annoying now. Much better than that arrogant brat this morning.”</span></p>
