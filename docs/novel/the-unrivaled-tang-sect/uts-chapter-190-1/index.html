The heads that blew apart resembled blood-red flowers. While they dazzled, they withered instantly. As they withered, it also meant that the lives of the soul engineers were about to end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What skill did they use? There were several soul engineers! Each of them was at least a Soul Ancestor. However, they were all instantly killed by this strange yet terrifying soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both parties were in shock as they watched the blood that flowed and the heads that were blown apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth that had rebutted Huo Yuhao earlier turned pale from fright. His mind was completely blank now. The only thought that he had was how was it possible for Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong to possess such frightening abilities even though they were so young.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What skill were they using?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it a martial fusion soul skill?” Ke Ke muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi bit her lips and watched as the two of them rushed over. She was thankful at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had succeeded. There were more than eighty soul engineers! However, these soul engineers were all quickly killed! None of them survived. Not only was the greatest strength of the enemy eliminated, but the enemy was also intimidated. The troops that had surrounded the mountain were now advancing at a slower pace. This was especially so for the troops on the side of the soul engineers that were killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is that his real strength? The strength that he unleashed with his partner? Shrek Academy is deservedly the best academy on the continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, you’ve saved me once again. Why is fate making a fool of me? Why am I seeing you again?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tears streamed uncontrollably down Ju Zi’s cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong quickly made their way up to the mountaintop. They didn’t utter a sound, but instead immediately sat cross-legged on the ground. Huo Yuhao’s right hand and Wang Dong’s left hand met. The Haodong Power circulated, and Golden Light Left Arm Bone was activated as they quickly restored their soul power. They also held onto Milk Bottles with their other hand to replenish their soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, they fully demonstrated the difference between their martial souls and the martial souls of the soul engineers around them. They were consuming the same Class 4 Milk Bottles, but they managed to finish absorbing the soul power within them in half a minute. The two of them quickly took out more Milk Bottles and continued to absorb more soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t sufficient to just absorb the soul power in the Milk Bottles. One’s body had to be strong enough to withstand the high rate of absorption. Otherwise, side effects might arise from absorbing it too quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi’s gaze turned cold as she shouted at the soul engineers around her, “What are all of you looking at? Take your positions and be ready for battle. Do you think the enemy will stop attacking us just because their soul engineers are dead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The soul engineers who were low on morale earlier started to become excited. They used the terrain to find suitable offensive spots. They were defensively prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s abilities didn’t just defeat the enemy’s soul engineers. They also boosted the morale of the soul engineers that Ju Zi commanded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they realized that it would be very difficult for them to escape, and they were surrounded by the enemy’s troops, their morale was very low. They knew that their own troops would trap the enemy and get rid of them. However, just as Huo Yuhao had mentioned, how long could they survive? They couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s dominant performance ignited their hopes again. No one would want to die if they could survive. Moreover, the two of them who had just performed a miracle were on their side. If they were able to kill more than eighty soul engineers, the rest of the ordinary soldiers were nothing to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their morale was high with such a belief, and the Milk Bottles to support them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi and Ke Ke looked at each other, and they both heaved a sigh of relief. They knew that their chances of survival had been greatly boosted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi didn’t look at Huo Yuhao again. She was afraid of affecting her emotions. She started to command her troops calmly and adjusted their positions. She also peered into the distance. Their reinforcements should be arriving soon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shut his eyes. He was also astonished by such a scene. After all, it was his first time killing so many people at one go. Even though this was the battlefield, it still impacted him. He could maintain his composure during the battle. However, some emotional fluctuations were inevitable after the battle. He still remembered that Elder Mu had told him that he needed to step onto a battlefield if he wanted to realize the Ultimate Soldier Plan. Today, he had stepped onto a battlefield. Against the thousands of enemy troops, he had to protect his partner and save someone who was once his friend. The pressure didn’t make him anxious, but fearful. It was a fear amidst excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong weren’t superior to the over eighty soul engineers just because they had completed their move. This was the result of Huo Yuhao’s perfect grasp and control of the enemy’s mindset and condition. The psychological lessons of the Ultimate Soldier Plan were coming into use now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Spiritual Detection had allowed him to tell that the enemy soul engineers were relaxed after they had completed their encirclement. Furthermore, they were also depleted after their long pursuit. They didn’t expect anyone from Ju Zi’s camp to rush out to attack them so suddenly under such a circumstance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had exploited the enemy’s complacency. He and Wang Dong rushed towards them at an alarming speed. When the soul engineers reacted, they were already able to unleash their strongest fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These calculations had formed in Huo Yuhao’s mind instantly. His instant-kill strike with Wang Dong was also built on his precise calculations. The enemy’s troops were tired and hurt. Along with Ju Zi’s intelligence, he had accurately estimated their enemy’s abilities. This had allowed them to succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, their martial fusion soul skill was very powerful! As their abilities continued to improve, their martial fusion soul skills grew along with their cultivations. This was the scariest part of their martial fusion soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For an ordinary soul master, the might of his soul skills was restricted by his cultivation and control. In addition, the age of his soul rings was also an important factor. However, a martial fusion soul skill would grow more powerful as one’s cultivation increased regardless of who he was. Of course, that was not including Huo Yuhao’s extraordinary situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a Soul Ancestor, while Wang Dong was a Soul Emperor. Their combined martial fusion soul skill couldn’t even be resisted by a seven-ringed Soul Sage! Furthermore, the Mantra Amidst the Void, Spiritual Tempest they had unleashed earlier had been a spiritual power attack using a soul skill. The true meaning behind it was like the long-range attack version of the Sovereign’s Descent. It was even formed by the combination of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spiritual Tempest exhibited a terrifying lethality. Those Class 4 and Class 5 soul engineers had enhanced their soul power using medicine, thus their foundations weren’t stable. They also weren’t supported by stable spiritual power. All of them were struck once by Huo Yuhao’s complete Spiritual Shock mixed with the explosive force of the Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This strike was fast yet effective. The greatest threat was wiped out in one blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After remaining silent for a while, the enemies attacked again. However, their morale was greatly affected. This was especially so for those who had seen the soul engineers being wiped out. They moved extremely slowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, not everyone from the enemy’s troops had witnessed what had happened. Some of the soldiers that came from different directions burst up the mountain quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sounds of soul cannons and soul rays being fired echoed repeatedly. With the Milk Bottles and their high morale, Ju Zi and her group resisted the enemy’s advance to the greatest of their abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lights could be seen shining from the mountaintop from afar. They reached all the way to the enemy’s camp, and caused intense explosive booms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A soul engineer’s lethality on the battlefield couldn’t be matched by soul masters at the same level. This was especially so against ordinary soldiers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul cannon shells landed amongst the enemy’s troops and blew apart, releasing balls of intense light. The soldiers were completely blown apart. Blood spurted, and flesh was strewn all over the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The explosive strength of a Class 4 soul cannon could cause massive destruction within a hundred square meters radius. Every blast was sufficient to kill tens of soldiers. While soul rays were weaker, they were more accurate. As they complemented the soul cannons, the death toll of the enemy rose beyond five hundred in a matter of minutes. However, the repeated attacks also depleted the soul power of the soul engineers.</span></p>
