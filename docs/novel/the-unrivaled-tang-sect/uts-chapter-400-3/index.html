Shrek Academy also had several hundred stationary soul cannon shells of different classes. More than five hundred shells were fired in this first round, since there were many Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons available.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If their monetary value was measured, it would take a long time to count the number of zeroes in the number generated.</span></p>

Even if they won this war, they would need to save up for a long time before they could obtain so many stationary soul cannon shells again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul beasts were a little surprised by the range of the humans’ attack. However, the shells were fired into the distance. The soul beasts that were charging in front towards the city wall weren’t affected. Very soon, the soul beast army was already beneath the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons were fired once again. This time, their strength was unleashed. As a large number of cannon shells rained down, explosive bombs started to engulf and strike the charging soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the booms generated from the detonation of the first round of shells had just echoed in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around one-third of the five hundred shells were intercepted. The remaining two-thirds managed to detonate successfully. The tragic screams of soul beasts could be heard amid the terrifying booms caused by the explosions. While some of these shells were intercepted, their explosive strength was still superior to the regular explosive bombs of the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Class 7 stationary soul cannon shell landed among the soul beasts, the space in the entire region affected by the subsequent explosion completely collapsed. A black halo started to spread, and only stopped when it reached a diameter of three hundred meters. Then, this black region started to distort tremendously, and countless bolts of lightning surrounded this region. An airflow filled with a destructive aura started to spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The name of this Class 7 stationary soul cannon shell was Lightning of Hell. Its terrifying destructive power instantly took the lives of thousands of soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the rest of the Class 4, 5 and 6 stationary soul cannon shells were weaker, each of them still managed to hurt and kill many soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, Shi Xing discovered that the Tang Sect’s stationary soul cannon shells were much stronger than the shells produced by the Academy. There were practically no Class 4 shell and hardly any Class 5 shells. Most of them were either Class 6 or Class 7. The explosion of every shell managed to affect a large region. They were extremely lethal, and he was struck breathless as he watched the explosions unfold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the defenses of the other three sides of the city were weaker, they were reinforced with more stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the four Savage Beasts were all astonished as they watched the various cannon shells exploding. They hadn’t expected humans to possess such terrifying weapons. Ordinary soul beasts were unable to resist such weapons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the first wave of stationary shells exploded, more than fifteen thousand soul beasts were either hurt or killed. Most of them were dead; there were very few injured soul beasts. The number of soul beasts that became casualties after this attack was much greater than the losses the soul beasts had suffered after the earlier confrontations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Savage Beasts started to get depressed. All of them had different characters, which naturally meant that their reactions were different. Compared to the Bear Lord’s irritation, the Myriad Demon King’s gloominess and the Scarlet King’s fury, Bi Ji was feeling cold in her heart right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humans actually possess such terrifying weapons? Since when did this happen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek City is probably the most difficult city to attack among all the human cities, but it’s still only one of the many cities around! How many of these weapons are present in the three human empires? Are the soul beasts from the Great Star Dou Forest capable of resisting these weapons with their flesh and blood, and eventually attaining victory?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it might not be difficult to annihilate Shrek City. However, it’s going to be extremely difficult to annihilate the entire human race!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The losses they had suffered from attacking Shrek City thus far had exceeded their earlier estimations. However, it was impossible for them to stop halfway. There was no way they could retreat anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Emerald Swans, start healing with all your abilities,” Bi Ji spoke in a strange voice. Following her words, jade-green figures started to quickly rise into the sky not far away from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were swans that were covered by bright jade-green light. After they rose into the sky, they immediately flew in all four directions. Each of them released a gentle, jade-green light from their bodies, and they started to heal the soul beasts that were injured by the explosions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were from the same species as Bi Ji. All these years, she had been protecting and nurturing them to become the healing team of the Great Star Dou Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emerald Swans lacked defensive strength, and there were only a hundred of them. They weren’t supposed to appear on a battlefield, as the Forest couldn’t afford to lose any of them. However, Bi Ji had no choice but to summon them, given the great number of casualties right now. She couldn’t possibly heal all the soul beasts by herself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only good news for the soul beast army was that the frontline soul beasts had already charged their way to Shrek City’s wall now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless long-range attacks were targeted towards the top of the walls right now, as if they were meteor showers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the soul masters did their best to activate their protective soul barriers to defend against the long-range attacks. However, the four Savage Beasts were determined this time. The soul beasts that were charging in front were thousand-year soul beasts, and they were led by a large number of ten-thousand-year soul beasts. Hundred year soul beasts weren’t even allowed to join the frontline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This managed to greatly increase the soul beasts’ defensive and offensive strength, and the destructiveness of the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons fell greatly. ten-thousand-year soul beasts still found it fine to resist the attacks of explosive bombs. If a large number of ten-thousand-year soul beasts defended together, they would greatly reduce the lethality of the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons, while the thousand-year soul beasts behind the ten-thousand-year soul beasts unleashed relentless long-range attacks towards Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They weren’t just attacking the top of the city walls; they were also attacking the city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tremendous booms echoed as different colors of light waves and soul power undulations could be seen encircling Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fight had reached an intense stage right from the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dean Xian.” Shi Xing immediately turned to look at Xian Lin’er after unleashing his Spacetime Turbulence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xian Lin’er gritted her teeth, and her cheek muscles trembled a little. After this, she shouted, “Fire all the stationary soul cannon shells. Don’t hold any back!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul beasts’ attack was too ferocious. The ten thousand and thousand-year soul beasts on their frontline placed immense pressure on Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under such a circumstance, she couldn’t place any sentimental attachment on the cannon shells anymore, and had to use them all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stationary cannon shells were fired towards the distance once again, and they scattered in different directions to stall the reserves of the soul beast army from following the frontline soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sixty-one self-driving forts were also thrown into the fight, and they were resisting the attacks of the soul beasts on the other three sides of the city wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone from the Tang Sect was now at the southern city wall. Without a doubt, this was the side of the city that faced the greatest pressure. While the attacks being launched against the other three sides of the city were also very strong, the greatest number of ten-thousand-year soul beasts were charging towards the south side of Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, He Caitou, Xiao Xiao, Ji Juechen, Jing Ziyan, Na Na, Mo Xuan and the others were all waiting as they adopted a strict formation.</span></p>

He was given priority access to Sealed Milk Bottles, as he was needed to offer all-around auxiliary support on the battlefield. With him around, the overall fighting strength of the soul masters could be raised by twenty percent!</span></p>
