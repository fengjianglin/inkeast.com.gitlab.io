 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

It was extremely terrifying as it unleashed its full strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Xuanwu had been dyed black by the power of darkness. When the Judgment Sword turned into a beam of golden light that descended from the sky, the power of darkness started to rumble. The clash between darkness and light would never be peaceful. The terrifying strength that was unleashed was sufficient to make anyone afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Jiang Nannan started to tense up, and subconsciously took a few steps forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given their current levels, they couldn’t withhold too much of their power, even if they did withhold some. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to fully unleash their potential. Jiang Nannan wasn’t confident that Xu Sanshi could block the Judgment Sword. Without being able to use his Mysterious Underworld Displacement, Xu Sanshi could only use his defensive strength to resist the attack! Could he possibly resist it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gold and black were about to clash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was at this moment that something weird appeared. When the huge golden sword clashed with the black, the black seemed to turn illusory for a moment. Following this, the aura of light on the huge golden sword met the power of darkness and exploded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tremendous boom reverberated, the Judgment Sword unleashing great power at the core of the Xuanwu Domain. Even the sword was affected to some extent, and shook tremendously at the center of the explosion. However, with the protection of the power of light, it wasn’t harmed too much. Even so, Ji Juechen’s soul power was almost entirely drained after this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as everyone was worried about Xu Sanshi, they were shocked to see a trace of gold silently appearing at an edge of the Xuanwu Domain. When it first appeared, it wasn’t very evident. However, the golden light soon shone brightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wasn’t this the Golden Xuanwu?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Xuanwu Domain disappeared in the next instant, but the Golden Xuanwu surfaced at its edge immediately. After that, blinding golden light was suddenly released from the Golden Xuanwu. The red snake that had always been attached to the Golden Xuanwu’s body turned into a beam of red light and fused with the Golden Xuanwu. A fierce blood-red aura immediately spread out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Xu Sanshi’s Martial Soul True Body, the Turtle God’s Strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Xuanwu was like a huge glowing ball charging straight towards the huge sword that had been greatly drained of soul power by its previous attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All Ji Juechen could do was turn his sword around and point the tip accurately towards the Golden Xuanwu. At the same time, he tried his best to summon his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah!” Jing Ziyan exclaimed. Everyone could tell that Ji Juechen would be unable to block Xu Sanshi’s attack, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gold light flashed past, and the sword was completely fine. The Turtle God’s Strike suddenly fell when it was around three meters away from the sword, where it struck the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground shook, and even the small stream beside Huo Yuhao and the others started to ripple a little. Suddenly, jets of water shot out from the stream, and sparks started to fly from the bonfire boiling the water. The pot of fish soup flew up into the air, along with the fish inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Huo Yuhao’s reactions were very quick. He waved his right hand and grabbed the boiling metal pot. At the same time, his figure flashed, and he managed to prevent any soup or fish from dropping to the ground. No soup was spilled at all. The other metal pot that was filled with marinated fish also flew up, but there wasn’t any water inside. He only needed to catch the fish inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu seemed to be amused as she looked at Jing Ziyan beside her. She said, “Indeed, one feels pain over her own man!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan’s face turned red, and she laughed. “Sister Qiuqiu, you should find someone who will make you feel pain, too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu stuck out her tongue and ran to one side to help Huo Yuhao control the bonfire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword turned back into Ji Juechen when it landed on the ground. He looked a little pale, but stood firmly. He turned around to look at the Golden Xuanwu behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Ji Juechen had come to the Tang Sect, he had never stopped finding Xu Sanshi to spar with. Xu Sanshi was a defense-type soul master, which meant that he was able to last longer in a fight. However, there was still a gap between Xu Sanshi and Ji Juechen’s cultivations. Ji Juechen’s sword was extremely sharp, and Xu Sanshi would always be on the losing end. He had lost so many times such that he would hide whenever he saw Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Things had finally gone his way today. Xu Sanshi managed to defeat Ji Juechen through the Golden Tortoise that he had fused with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did you manage to get away?” Ji Juechen furrowed his brow slightly. He was still thinking about their last collision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were any other soul master, Ji Juechen would immediately be frowned upon if he dared to ask about the other soul master’s ultimate move. However, everyone from the Tang Sect was like brothers. While Xu Sanshi always hid from Ji Juechen, he still admired his focus greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe, the Golden Tortoise is a hundred-thousand-year soul beast, and it gave me a trunk bone. Earlier, I used one of the two soul skills of its trunk bone, Golden Tortoise Molting. By using that soul skill, I’m able to overcome all problems and teleport myself to any specific spot in my Xuanwu Domain. It’s much more effective than Instant Teleportation. However, it costs one-third of my soul power every time I use it. I am drained a lot by using it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh.” Ji Juechen acknowledged his words and turned around before walking towards the side of the river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was a little depressed as he said, “Hey, can’t you just praise me for being strong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen turned his head to look at him and said, “We’ll decide whether you’re strong after we fight again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… am I digging my own grave?” Xu Sanshi looked at Ji Juechen and was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them returned to the side of the river, and Jiang Nannan was the first to run over. She pulled Xu Sanshi’s ears, “Why are you showing off? You still smashed the ground. Do you have too much energy and nowhere to use it? See how bad you shook this place! Don’t eat later. Starve! I’m afraid you can’t fully use all your energy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi coughed, “It wasn’t intentional...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled, “I agree with fourth senior’s opinion. Third senior, you should be starved.” The bonfire had already been messed up and had to be reassembled. The pot of fish soup that was supposed to be done soon had to be re-boiled as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi wore a toady smile on his face. “Don’t! I have waited so long for my little junior to cook. How can I not taste his cooking? Come, come, everyone move away. I’ll perform some chores.” As he spoke, he quickly leaped over and helped Huo Yuhao with the bonfire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong stood by the side of the river and watched as everyone joked around. She was a little dazed when she saw how happy everyone was. Although she felt that she didn’t blend in with them, she discovered that she rather liked such an atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Due to Xu Sanshi’s earlier mistake, he offered to watch the fish soup. On the other side, the grilled fish were almost completely marinated. Huo Yuhao assembled the branches that Ye Guyi had washed earlier and stacked them above the bonfire on the other side before starting to grill the fish. At the same time, he took some dry rations over and started to heat them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of them were very young, and thus it was natural that ladies were given the first priority. As the fragrance of the grilled fish diffused in the air, the first to start digging in became a huge topic of debate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone formed a circle as they sat beside the fires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan laughed, “The grilled fish smell really good. Who’s going to start first?”</span></p>

Huo Yuhao didn’t choose to grill more than one fish at once in order to ensure that they were of the utmost quality. If he grilled too many fish at once, there might be some flaws in his control of the fire, as well as the seasoning of the fish.</span></p>

She couldn’t control her appetite, and ended up swallowing her words.</span></p>
