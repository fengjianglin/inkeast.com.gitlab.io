 <p><strong>Book 4: The Golden Road</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 28.1:&nbsp;Synergic Cooperation, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong Achieve Victory&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had buried his hatred for Dai Huabin in the very depths of his heart. It had already turned into a driving force for him, and as such he was willing to go to any lengths to get revenge for his mother. However, this was Shrek Academy, and he wanted to stay here in order to become even stronger. The revenge he wanted wasn’t just a simple massacre either—he wanted to console his mother’s soul in heaven. He knew what his mother’s greatest wish was; it was something that she hadn’t even dared to hope to accomplish while she’d been alive. However, Huo Yuhao still aimed to complete it. Because of that, he couldn’t just throw everything away just for revenge. Regardless of whether or not he could defeat Dai Huabin, he couldn’t throw away his life’s greatest wish for a single person. If the truth were to be exposed, he might not be able to continue studying at Shrek Academy. Therefore, he could only endure; he could only bury his hatred and use his own method to obtain revenge.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s opponents during the semifinals were three Soul Grandmasters from Class 10. Moreover, they possessed somewhat strange martial souls.</p>
 <p>Even though their opponents didn’t have any three-ringed Soul Elders on their team, they definitely still weren’t weak. After all, they’d been able to stand out from the masses and reach their current positions.</p>
 <p>The three freshmen from Class 10 were all boys that had heroic and exuberant appearances.</p>
 <p>“Class 10, Zhou Sichen. I’m an assault system Soul Grandmaster.”</p>
 <p>“Class 10, Long Xiangyue. I’m an agility system Soul Grandmaster.”</p>
 <p>“Class 10, Cao Jinxuan. I’m a control system Soul Grandmaster.”</p>
 <p>Their resounding and forceful voices were a manifestation of their confidence. They didn’t have any traces of fear in their eyes as they faced Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>“Class 1, Huo Yuhao. I’m a control system Soul Master.”</p>
 <p>“Class 1, Wang Dong. I’m an assault system Soul Grandmaster.”</p>
 <p>Due to Wang Dong’s breathtaking performance during their previous match, the proctor—who could be considered the judge of the semifinal round—had been switched to a roughly sixty-year-old elder. He gave off an extremely strong aura simply by standing there, showing that he was an extremely strong existence. He was clearly an especially strong teacher that’d been sent out to prevent any accidents from occurring during the match.</p>
 <p>“Match, start!” As soon as the proctor announced it, the semifinals officially began. At the same time, an intense clash had also begun in Arena 1, where Dai Huabin was.</p>
 <p>Since it was only the two of them left, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong couldn’t move far away from each other; they clearly understood that they didn’t have any chance of victory in a 2v3 situation without using their Haodong Power.</p>
 <p>This time around, Huo Yuhao stood in front, while Wang Dong stood behind him. Afterwards, the two of them simultaneously released their martial souls. Wang Dong then folded his wings around Huo Yuhao, enveloping him within them like a mat awning.</p>
 <p>Their opponents had clearly done some research on their battle styles. Considering Wang Dong’s sudden explosiveness in yesterday’s match, they’d paid a large amount of attention to him. As such, their opponents instantly released all of their strength the moment the match started.</p>
 <p>However, the agility system Long Xiangyue didn’t charge forwards straightaway. Instead, he quickly hid behind Zhou Sichen’s back. Surprisingly, Cao Jinxuan did the same as well, causing the three of them to stand in a straight line.</p>
 <p>In that instant, their strange martial souls appeared.</p>
 <p>A white light shone as as a book appeared within Zhou Sichen’s hands. At the same time, both of his hundred year soul rings lit up, causing the book’s pages to flutter open and release two rays of light in succession. These rays of light then congealed in front of him.</p>
 <p>This was Zhou Sichen’s special Tool Soul, the Treasure Bible.</p>
 <p>Normally speaking, book-type martial souls were trash souls that very few people had been able to successfully cultivate. However, Zhou Sichen had a variant martial soul; his Treasure Bible had even given him Rank 7 innate soul power. Furthermore, he could directly absorb the energy of any soul beast he killed for its soul ring, whenever his soul power reached a bottleneck. Most importantly, he had no attribute restrictions for his soul rings, so he could absorb and utilise the abilities of any soul rings he absorbed. In other words, he could use an ice-type soul skill one moment, before using a fire-type soul skill the next. It was an extremely unusual Tool Soul.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he’d released two soul skills, which had in-turn formed two beasts. One of the beasts he’d summoned was a bear covered in yellow light, while the other was a fierce tiger covered in flames.</p>
 <p>Ever since he’d obtained his Treasure Bible, Zhou Sichen’s goal had been to become an assault system soul master. Because of that, even though he could choose any soul beast to become his soul ring, he’d only chosen ones that had assault system soul skills. This was all for the sake of his dream of becoming an assault system soul master.</p>
 <p>The bear and tiger duo hurriedly rushed in front of the three, then roared towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>However, the person standing behind him wasn’t the agility system Long Xiangyue, but the control system Cao Jinxuan. Cao Jinxuan had a look of concentration in his eyes, and was emitting a distorted halo of light. Even people standing next to him would think that he looked somewhat blurry. However, despite that, an exquisite clock had quietly appeared above his head.</p>
 <p>The clock itself was horseshoe-shaped, and its white body was roughly half a meter tall. Its watch face was round, and a rotor engraved with golden patterns lightly swayed beneath it. After the clock appeared, both of Cao Jinxuan’s hundred year soul rings seemed to have become a part of his body, causing them to rhythmically sway in-sync with the clock.</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen’s Treasure Bible was already something rare, but Cao Jinxuan’s clock was a rarity amongst rarities; his martial soul was known as the ‘Time Elapsing Clock’, and its rarity amongst Tool Souls wasn’t inferior to Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>The three were simultaneously moving together, so naturally, Long Xiangyue couldn’t be lacking compared to the other two. He’d maintained a relatively large distance from Cao Jinxuan, but they were still in a straight line. Despite being an agility system soul master, he unexpectedly possessed a Tool Soul as well. After releasing his martial soul, an enormous boomerang appeared in his hand. One ‘side’ of the boomerang was more than a foot long, so it looked somewhat imbalanced in the hands of Long Xiangyue, who hadn’t even turned twelve.</p>
 <p>After the boomerang appeared in his hand, Long Xiangyue paused slightly for a moment. Immediately afterwards, he bent his body backwards, then abruptly swung his body back towards the front as he sent the boomerang flying out. In the instant that he made his move, both of his soul rings lit up.</p>
 <p>However, his expression suddenly changed the instant he made his move, as his originally clear judgement had suddenly turned vague.</p>
 <p>Their three-man formation was undoubtedly specialised to fight against Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong; how could the two of them simply sit there and watch without doing anything?</p>
 <p>Of the five people in the arena, the first person to have released their soul skill had actually been Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>The instant he’d seen their opponents line themselves up, he’d known that they wouldn’t be able to pull off the same trick against them. Regardless of who he was fighting against, Huo Yuhao would always release his Spiritual Detection Sharing in the first possible instant that he could. It was practically undetectable, yet it was able to give them an extremely large advantage.</p>
