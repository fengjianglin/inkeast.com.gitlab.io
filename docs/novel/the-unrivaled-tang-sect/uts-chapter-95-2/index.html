 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 95.2: The Top 10 Savage Beasts</strong></p>
 <p>“You… you guys…” Wang Dong gasped as he stood at the doorway, stunned at the sight before his eyes, which started to grow red.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao stretched once more before she sauntered to the door and came up in front of Wang Dong. She tapped him lightly on the head. “Don’t think about all this nonsense at such a young age. I think he’s fine, and you look like you’ve recovered as well. Go grab a bite together,” she said as she pushed the door open and stepped out.</p>
 <p>This light tap on the head knocked Wang Dong to his senses and he instantly reoriented himself. He scratched his head and laughed at himself – yes! We’re only twelve years old.</p>
 <p>“How are you, Yuhao? You look like you were just violated,” Wang Dong snapped.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao dove right back under his blanket. “Xiaotao was right – your head is just full of nonsense with all that talk of violation. She said we won, so please tell me, how did we win?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong grunted and sat down on the same stool that Ma Xiaotao had just gotten up from. “Of course it was done with a single hammer stroke from my Soul Elder that silenced them all.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was a little confused, and asked curiously, “Was I not the one that dealt the winning blow?” Even though he didn’t know what had happened, he had absolute faith in the powers of the Ice Empress.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong recounted the final scenes of the battle in detail, including the part where he threw out the hammer.</p>
 <p>“A hammer? Truly a masterstroke! That must be your second Martial Soul. What’s it called?” Huo Yuhao asked curiously.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong watched his face of plain calmness and asked with amused impertinence, “Aren’t you surprised that I have two Martial Souls?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao grunted and answered, “What’s so surprising about that? I’ve known that all along.”</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Wang Dong glared and opened his eyes wide. “No way! I’ve never revealed my second Martial Soul before!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao laughed mischievously and said, “But our Martial Souls have fused before. Don’t you know the requirements for a Martial Soul Fusion Skill? Teacher Wang Yan said it before – even though a Martial Soul Fusion Skill doesn’t require both parties to have the same Martial Souls, they have to be compatible with each other. The strength of the Martial Soul Fusion is also intricately connected to our compatibility, and our compatibility rate was so high that even Teacher Wang said it was extremely rare. How can it be that I have two martial souls and you only have one? I will never believe that! So, even though I don’t know what it is, I’ve always known you had a second martial soul.”</p>
 <p>“Then why have you never asked?” Wang Dong murmured as he lowered his head.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao shrugged. “Why would I? Everybody has their own secrets. Even though we are the best of friends, probing into others’ secrets is not a good thing. Everybody needs personal space, no?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong raised his head once again as he glanced at Huo Yuhao with a look of astonishment. “That means that you have a secret that I don’t know about! Quick, spill it!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao chortled and said with resolute righteousness, “Over my dead body!”</p>
 <p>A cunning look came over Wang Dong’s face. “So you won’t say it unless I beat you till you’re dead?” He pounced on Huo Yuhao as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Help!” Huo Yuhao screamed as they fought into a bundle with the blanket separating them.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong tugged on the blanket and Huo Yuhao, who was hiding underneath it, was instantly completely exposed…</p>
 <p>“Ah…”A shrill cry came out from Wang Dong’s mouth as he saw the said “little peanut” that Ma Xiaotao was just talking about.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao snatched the blanket back and glared at Wang Dong with furious eyes. “You gangster – you even want to peep at people of the same gender?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong recovered at the same time and shot back, “So you’ve peeped at people of the opposite gender?”</p>
 <p>“I… Of course I haven’t!” Huo Yuhao denied, but the glorious images of his tryst with Ma Xiaotao inside Sea God’s Lake slowly drifted into his head. For young men, it is normal to have such fantasies as long as one doesn’t lose control.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong leapt down from the bed with puffy cheeks and said, “Alright, go wash up and get dressed now so we can eat. I came to see you as soon as I woke up, so I’m famished. I haven’t eaten anything since the competition yesterday.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he turned around and strolled over to the sofa on the side and closed his eyes as he turned away from Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao got out of bed as well and stretched his body, feeling sore all over. However, after a night’s rest and the natural healing abilities of the Mysterious Heaven Technique, his mobility was not affected.</p>
 <p>“You’re right, it’s time to grab a bite. We should continue training and healing once we’re done eating. My overdraft from the competition is serious, and my passageways are swelling with discomfort. We still have another round of the competition tomorrow, so we have to try our best to recover today. We’ve only cleared a single challenging hurdle – eh? Who’s that?”</p>
 <p>As they were speaking to each other, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt an ominous tinge of alarm flash by in his head as he glanced towards the window subconsciously.</p>
 <p>Following the continuous rise in his abilities and his training of the spiritual sea, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual awareness was a lot sharper than before. In addition to that fact, the arriving party had no intention to mask himself or herself, so Huo Yuhao detected the intruder at the first possible instance.</p>
 <p>In a flash, a single person appeared before Huo Yuhao. Fortunately, he was properly dressed at this point, and his “little peanut” wasn’t exposed.</p>
 <p>The person who came was an elder, who was scraggy and of average height. However, he seemed to be brimming with energy. On the surface, he appeared to be around 60 years old, and his short hair was dark-brown. His gaze was filled with passion and vigor as it landed on Huo Yuhao. An invisible pressure bore down on Huo Yuhao and stifled him instantly.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong, whose eyes were originally shut, immediately bounced up upon hearing Huo Yuhao’s voice and stood beside him. There was no doubt that the elderly man who had come in through the window didn’t harbor good intentions.</p>
 <p>The elderly man did not respond. As he raised his right hand, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong felt their eyes go dark as the surrounding light dimmed. A frightening soul power that left them fetid permeated the entire room in an instant.</p>
 <p>At this point, they felt like they were trapped in a cage, without even a chance to struggle and resist.</p>
 <p>As he watched the elderly man, Huo Yuhao was bewildered. He had never seen this man before and neither did he know what he was here for.</p>
 <p>“Elder, who are you? Are you here to find me?” Huo Yuhao posed the same question again. At the same time, he lifted his hand to protect Wang Dong, who was behind him.</p>
 <p>Both he and Wang Dong did not unleash their martial souls at this moment, as they could sense the immense gap between them and this elderly man in front of them. He was not someone that could be resisted easily even if they teamed up together against him. Since this was the case, unleashing their martial souls could have the undesirable effect of provoking the elderly man. At the very least, they had to clarify the situation first.</p>
 <p>The elderly man snorted as he cast his piercing and vigorous gaze on Huo Yuhao’s face. He said indifferently, “Tell me, which human form of the Ten Great Savage Beasts are you? While you have concealed yourself well, you can’t fool me, even though you might fool others.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was incredulous as he replied, “What do you mean, Ten Great Savage Beasts? Elder, I have no idea what you are talking about.”</p>
 <p>“You have no idea what I am talking about? Stop pretending; it’s useless. Don’t even think of trying to escape. With your current abilities, you don’t stand a chance against me. I have already sealed this place with my soul power. Neither your voice nor your body will have a single shred of a chance of escaping.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao furrowed his brows. “Elder, I have seriously no idea what you’re talking about or why you are here.”</p>
 <p>The elderly man guffawed and seemed to be very proud of himself, “Very well, since you’re not going to admit anything, I shall expose you then. I shall let you die convinced.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the elderly man stepped forward and his aura erupted, forcing Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong to retreat uncontrollably. They even fell back onto the sofa.</p>
 <p>“I am Cheng Gang, the Protector Douluo of the Star Luo Empire. On that day, how did you manage to emerge victorious over your opponent during the competition between Shrek Academy and Justsky Academy?”</p>
 <p>After hearing his words, Huo Yuhao’s heart could not help but skip a beat, as he understood what the elderly man was talking about. While Huo Yuhao was not exceptionally smart, he had become much more intelligent after he fused with the Skydream Iceworm. Not only was he much more mature than others of the same age, he was also more pensive. He now understood that the elderly man could have sensed the aura of the Ice Empress, which explained the man’s previous question. The elderly man had taken him for the human form of a hundred thousand year soul beast!</p>
 <p>As Cheng Gang looked at the stunned Huo Yuhao, he assumed that Huo Yuhao was feeling guilty over what he said and added, “During the competition, you were forced to use your origin power, am I right? At that moment, you inevitably revealed the aura that you originally possessed. To others, they might not have noticed, but you can’t escape my sharp eyes. My Martial Soul contains a spiritual sense that is extremely sensitive. At the very first moment, I had already felt your aura.”</p>
 <p>“Let me think, among the Ten Great Savage Beasts, only two of them belong in the ice-type category. One of them is the Snow Lady, who is ranked third, and the other is the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, who is ranked eighth. Which of them are you?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was truly stunned by the judgment of the elderly man now. Besides the fact that he was not the human form of a Soul Beast, this elderly man’s judgment was flawless.</p>
 <p>While the elderly man referred to her by a different name, Huo Yuhao could tell that the Snow Lady that the elderly man was talking about was actually the Snow Empress, as the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion called her. As for the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, wouldn’t it be referring to the Ice Empress herself?</p>
 <p>What was it with these Ten Great Savage Beasts? The Titan Snow Devil King, ranked last among the Three Heavenly Kings in the Extreme North, was not even included. As for the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, she was even only ranked eighth among the Ten Savage Beasts. The rankings were indeed frightening and astonishing!</p>
 <p>“Alright, you don’t have to act foolish anymore. You won’t stand a chance. I never expected my luck to be so good – that I would manage to catch one of the Ten Great Savage Beasts today. Whether you are the Snow Lady or the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion King, my reward will be an entire set of transcendent soul bones. Haha, hahahaha.”</p>
