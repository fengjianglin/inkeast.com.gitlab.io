 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was horrified. She turned around and kneeled once again. “No, Your Majesty. No, I can’t do that. How can I bear someone else’s child? I’m your Ju Zi, and will only be your Ju Zi. No, I don’t agree.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was a little stunned, and was also a little touched as he looked at Ju Zi. This was the first time she had dared to resist his orders ever since she had saved him. However, this resistance only stroked his ego.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If possible, no one would want his wife to have someone else’s kid. However, I have no choice. I can only do this to shut everyone up. I’ve even selected the candidate. He’s an authentic bearer of the royal blood lineage, and he’s a distant cousin of mine. Due to a mutation of his martial soul, he’s not even a soul master now, and he holds a very lowly position in the royal family. Apart from you, no one else must know about this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll ask someone to teach you how to carry it out. After that, you’ll retrieve the ‘seedling’ from his body and implant it into your own. After that, he’ll be killed. No one will know this secret then. Don’t worry, I am infertile. The child you bear will be ours. I’ll treat him like our biological son. When I turn a hundred years old, he’ll inherit the throne. Perhaps we might rule the entire Douluo Continent by then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi lifted her head and looked at Xu Tianran pitifully, “Your Majesty, is there no other way? I am really unwilling to do this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s expression turned cold and he said, “Alright, this is final. Do you really think I want to do this? I feel heartache doing it, too. Alright, with this sort of plan, you’ll be touched by another guy. Go and prepare first. I’ll get someone to teach you how to do it, and I’ll get the Imperial Physician to take a look at your body. These next few days are the best time for you to be impregnated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Ju Zi shuddered a little and eventually agreed to his words. She kowtowed to him respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s expression turned gentler. He lifted her up for the third time and patted her back. “Silly girl, don’t think too much. I already told you that I’ll treat the child you bear as our own. Only I have the right to be his father. You can go now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Your Majesty.” Ju Zi indignantly made her way out after bowing to Xu Tianran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After exiting, a heavy look gradually appeared on Ju Zi’s face. However, a cold intent that flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran, why didn’t I realize that I’ll only be your pawn? Even the closest pawn is still a pawn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao regained consciousness, he was stunned to discover that he was in a clean room. The room also looked very familiar to him. Everything around him was familiar, including the aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where am I?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a little puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything that had happened earlier replayed itself in his memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Didn’t I meet the Darkness Holy Dragon and Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao? Wasn’t I stabbed nine times because of his threat? But why don’t I feel any pain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He subconsciously touched his body, and was astonished to discover that there weren’t any wounds at all. He then circulated his soul power. His body drifted up above his bed, and there were suddenly strong soul power undulations in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was shocked as he sensed everything. He discovered that this soul power was like a strong wave. Just by circulating it slightly, it was actually surging.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s going on? Where exactly am I?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The door opened, and a figure rushed in. Wasn’t she Nan Qiuqiu?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw Huo Yuhao sitting up, Nan Qiuqiu was delighted. “Ah, Yuhao, you’re awake! You’re finally awake. What happened exactly!? You were unconscious for seven days!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at her and was shocked as he asked, “Am... am I really alive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu took a few steps forward and pinched his arm hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aiyo, what are you doing?!” Huo Yuhao screamed in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you know that it’s painful, it obviously means that you aren’t in a dream. Of course you aren’t dead!” Nan Qiuqiu snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “It was already not easy for me to come back alive, but you still pinched me so hard. Are you still human?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu furrowed her brow and placed her hands on her waist angrily. “How dare you mention it? You didn’t even bring me on your adventure to Heaven Dou City. How did Tang Wutong find you the moment she was there? Didn’t you say that she isn’t Dong’er?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing her mention Tang Wutong, Huo Yuhao was stunned, and asked, “Did she send me back? Is she fine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How would I know?” Nan Qiuqiu said coldly, “She dumped you here before leaving. She didn’t say anything at all, as if she were dumb.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow and sighed in his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong isn’t Dong’er after all! Although I don’t know why I’m alive, it seems like the Dragon Emperor Douluo still let her off in the end. It’s just that I was critically hurt then, and my life energy was about to fully disappear. Now that I think about it, it seemed like the last stab was blocked by something before it reached my body, preventing my heart from being struck. Don’t tell me the Dragon Emperor Douluo did it intentionally? He’s the only one who could do that at that point in time...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how did I survive? My injuries were so critical. Furthermore, I don’t even feel any pain now. On the other hand, my soul power even seems to have improved. I feel as if I have touched a bottleneck. What exactly is going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was filled with doubts as he climbed up from the bed. He moved his body. Indeed, he was filled with strength! Everything felt unbelievably good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was good to be alive. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao felt that a lot of the pressure on him had been relieved after he went through that near-death experience. The look in his eyes was much more vibrant compared to before. He couldn’t help but think of what Wang Dong’er had said to him: relieving stress from time to time was good for cultivation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, I’ve really been under a lot of pressure. I didn’t expect this to relieve so much pressure, although the way it was done wasn’t very nice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, what are you thinking of?” Nan Qiuqiu was displeased as she questioned Huo Yuhao, seeing that he had gone quiet all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “Nothing. Alright, Qiuqiu, how was I when I returned?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu answered, “Pretty good! You were just in a coma. There was nothing else really. Tang Wutong didn’t say anything else. She just seemed very confused. Eldest senior didn’t probe further upon seeing that you were fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I was fine when I returned? My wounds disappeared? It seems like I can only ask Tang Wutong to learn what’s going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Qiuqiu, I’ll go and see eldest senior first.” As he said that, he walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu chased after him and said, “Don’t forget what you promised me. Teacher Xuan seems to be very excited after seeing the metal that you brought back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh right, don’t worry. You won’t be excluded,” Huo Yuhao smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">----------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao saw Bei Bei, Bei Bei was dealing with a lot of things. Seeing him entering, Bei Bei was delighted before his expression sank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little junior, you are really incorrigible! I won’t let you leave the sect easily no matter what. Every time you leave, you have to get into some trouble. Tell me, what happened this time? Why were you in a coma, and Wutong had to bring you back? She didn’t want to say anything. Surely you can tell me what’s going on, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed as he said, “Eldest senior, don’t be angry! Nothing happened, really. I went to Heaven Dou City to capture an evil soul master, as well as to find out where Teacher Xiao Ya and Sister Xiaotao are at. I searched the city. They aren’t there. After that, I met a strong opponent when capturing an evil soul master, which drained me. I might have fallen into a coma because of that. Oh yes, I almost forgot...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he mentioned the evil soul master, Huo Yuhao immediately thought of two important questions. He wondered if the evil soul master he had sealed in his storage-type soul tool was alive after so many days. In addition, the Ice Bear King could still be in Heaven Dou City!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong?” Bei Bei jumped in shock when he heard Huo Yuhao trail off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t say anything, but hurriedly poured in his soul power into his storage-type soul tool. A light flashed before an ice statue appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice had improved compared to before. He had frozen the evil soul master for at least seven to eight days, but there weren’t any signs that it was going to melt. It wasn’t even damaged in the slightest. The evil soul master that was frozen inside was still astonished, and even terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was stunned as he asked, “This is… an evil soul master you caught?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Yes! It took me quite a lot of effort to capture this fellow.” When he faced the Darkness Holy Dragon, he wasn’t afraid at all. However, now that he thought of it, he was actually pretty terrified back then. Long Xiaoyao’s cultivation was not something that he could sense using his Spiritual Detection, because Long Xiaoyao was spiritually much stronger than him. It was very easy for him to put up a spiritual barrier that kept out Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power. Huo Yuhao had no way of dealing with Long Xiaoyao directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Long Xiaoyao’s spiritual power was stronger than his in terms of absolute volume rather than the level of it. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power had reached the concrete-material realm. Even the Dragon Emperor Douluo wasn’t at that realm yet. This was the advantage of a spiritual-type soul master. Just like Long Xiaoyao had said, if Huo Yuhao purely cultivated his Spirit Eyes to the standard of a Transcendent Douluo, he might actually be able to fight him. In fact, Huo Yuhao had the confidence of challenging Long Xiaoyao at that level when he considered his Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
