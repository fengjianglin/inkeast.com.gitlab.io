 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

After sensing the thought that Huo Yuhao transmitted to them, many of their bodies turned a bit rigid, but they soon regained their composure. They exchanged strange glances with one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you can hear my voice, please don’t move. I’m here to save all of you.” Huo Yuhao repeated his words once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, his communication was much clearer than before. Everyone could confirm that they weren’t hallucinating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, some of the younger hostages started to get excited. They had long since had enough after being held captive for a few months in complete darkness. They had even started to believe that they would never be free again, but this sudden voice soothed the pain in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, not everyone was excited. Those who were slightly older, and were either team leaders or teachers continued to remain alert. After all, how could they be sure that this wasn’t a ploy? Evil soul masters were capable of anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Calm down. I need everyone to calm down. If you want to escape, you need to keep calm. Otherwise, I won’t be able to help you. I’ll need everyone’s cooperation so that we can leave this place.” Huo Yuhao transmitted another thought to them. This time, his thought was completely clear in their minds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elders started to be moved. Who wouldn’t wish to escape this hell they were in?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest of the hostages started to calm down after their elders looked at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid that his interaction with them would be discovered by the evil soul masters. If that happened, they would be alerted, and that would make things much more difficult for them later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, you should have found out that the poison in your bodies is slowly being dispelled. That’s because I added an antidote to the water that all of you are immersed in. I believe the poison in your bodies will be completely removed by tomorrow. From now on, I hope all of you can do your best to recover your soul power and physical condition. We’ll take action the night after tomorrow. When that time comes, I’ll need all of you to cooperate with me so that we can charge out of this place in one go. Tomorrow, I’ll add more tonics to this water to help all of you recover. You must stay strong. We’ll only have one opportunity to leave this place and regain our freedom.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao explained his plan, and provided words of encouragement to the hostages. He had been watching the hostages through his Spiritual Detection earlier. If there were any spies among them, he would have detected some kind of emotional fluctuation, but the truth was that no one was willing to be stuck in this water prison, and thus there were naturally no spies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, continue to rest well. When you recover your soul power, you must not let the guards find out. Otherwise, everything will be futile. Elders, please take care of the younger ones and remember to help cover for them. I’m going to leave. We’ve already set up everything on the outside. I’ll give each of you a Heartcalming Pill. I’m from Shrek Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tang Sect’s reputation wasn’t as notable as Shrek Academy’s. This was why Huo Yuhao mentioned that he was from Shrek Academy to better reassure these hostages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gloomy atmosphere in the water prison started to change after Huo Yuhao told them his plan. The lifeless-looking eyes started to look brighter, and the elders who had already started to sense the recovery of their soul power started to circulate it. The water they were in that had brought them so much torment was now their best cover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao retracted his Spiritual Detection, but he didn’t leave. Instead, he unleashed his Spiritual Interference and engulfed the entire water prison with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his current spiritual power, the Zhong brothers and the two Titled Douluo elders would definitely discover his Spiritual Interference if they were here. However, these lower-ranked evil soul masters wouldn’t be able to discover anything unless they paid close attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was taking precautions. If there were spies that he had missed, or any soul master lost control of his emotions, he could still salvage the situation with his Spiritual Interference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his worries were unfounded. These soul masters and soul engineers from the various academies and sects were all strong enough. After a momentary shock, they soon regained their composure with the help of their elders. With the polluted water in the water prison as their cover, they could still control their emotions even though they were angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After observing them for an hour, Huo Yuhao calmed down and silently left the prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the start of a huge rescue operation. The Tang Sect’s operation was about to be unveiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao soon mixed more tonics into the polluted water. According to the information Ma Xiaotao had provided him, the toxicity of the Soul Eradicating Powder was very strong. It was only added in every half month. The next time it was going to be added into the water was in five days, and thus there was a vacuum now. Huo Yuhao’s rescue plan would be carried out during this vacuum period.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone from the Tang Sect was prepared to save the hostages. When the second night arrived, there was another guest in Sunrise City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This person was completely masked with a black veil and hat. Under this cover, it was impossible to tell his gender or age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He entered the city in a much more convenient method than ordinary people. He walked to the city gate and revealed a token. After this, he was allowed to enter the city without any checks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He walked in a weird manner. He seemed to be gently drifting, as if he were exerting no strength at all. He wasn’t walking very quickly. However, he was very adept at avoiding detection – if one tried to watch him, he would soon discover that this person would disappear from his view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, he came to a building with a pointed tip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Huo Yuhao were here right now, he would know that this building was the building that he had tailed Feng Ling to, and where he had discovered Wu Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he drifted into this building, he came to the place where Wu Yun had once hanged and hit Feng Ling. A sinister aura that was filled with grievance started to spread. He sat cross-legged on the ground and started to recite something before a red glow started to subtly surface behind his back. It seemed as if a weird human projection were drifting behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s done?” He Caitou asked Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and jumped down from the base of the egg-shaped soul tool. At this point, this wide room was filled with all types of soul tools. It was like an arsenal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou chortled and said, “Alright, leave this place to me. I’ll teach them a good lesson later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hurriedly instructed, “Second senior, don’t be tempted to fight. After you launch these soul tools, you must immediately meet everyone in the south.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, don’t worry. I know my limits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a look at the sky outside, which was getting darker and darker. “It’s about time. Third senior and the rest should be in position. I need to go over to prepare too. Second senior, be careful. If necessary, you must give up everything for your own safety.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou patted his shoulder and gave him a thumbs-up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao gave him a confident smile before saying, “Once this is over, all of you proceed south, and get on the boat when you reach it. Don’t wait for us. There are only a few of us, which will make it much more convenient for us to move around. We’ll meet back at the Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao…” He Caitou stopped Huo Yuhao and sounded a little hesitant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Second senior, I know what you want to say. However, there are things a man should and should not do. Since you’ve promised me, you should do your best. We’ll all be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Come back soon. We’ll celebrate in the Tang Sect.” He Caitou wasn’t a pushy guy either. After giving Huo Yuhao a thumbs-up again, he watched as Huo Yuhao left.</span></p>

He didn’t proceed to prepare immediately, but returned to their room in the hotel on the southern side.</span></p>

However, he was still a little lost, possibly because of the deep trauma he had suffered. It was as if he was unwilling to wake up from his dreams.</span></p>

After rescuing most of the hostages it would be the best opportunity for them to rescue Nan Shuishui. Nan Qiuqiu didn’t pose any objections to this. After Huo Yuhao decided to remain with her to rescue her mother, her attitude towards him changed greatly. She acted less proud in front of him.</span></p>
