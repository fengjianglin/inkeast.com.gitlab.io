 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Snow Lady was still a being of the Douluo Continent. Although she was a new existence, she couldn’t completely transcend this world’s laws. That was why she had to fuse with a soul master and his abilities even though she was alive on her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were someone else, they would only have one soul ring spot to contain the Snow Lady. In that case, the Snow Lady would lose a portion of her strength. Simply speaking, it was just like how a soul master absorbed a soul ring from a soul beast. The soul master couldn’t possibly obtain all the soul skills it had, and would only absorb one that was suitable for himself. But the Snow Lady was a living body, and thus naturally hoped to retain all her powers. However, she couldn’t do this alone, and needed Huo Yuhao to help her fulfil this wish. That was why she needed to take up many spots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The conditions she formed under were too unique, he couldn’t possibly replicate her. Even if Huo Yuhao could use the Contract Magic left behind by Electrolux, it still wouldn’t come close to making another Spirit like the Snow Empress. Besides, soul masters wouldn’t have the necessary spiritual power to accept as many Spirits as they want, or soul rings, for that matter. It was already unbelievable for a soul beast’s power to be compressed several times over without combusting. And even then, there was still a need for a strong entity to sacrifice their divine sense. How could Huo Yuhao possibly replicate this?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From one perspective, the Snow Empress’ strength would be restricted by Huo Yuhao’s abilities. From another viewpoint, she had managed to display her strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a third and fourth orange-gold soul ring appeared, the four soul rings moved along with the Ice Empress’ blood-red soul ring. At last, Huo Yuhao had officially become a Soul King. He had even added four soul rings in one go. However, he felt very helpless, as he couldn’t control these four new soul rings. They could only be controlled by the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surging undulations of his soul and spiritual power started to calm down. The fusion process between the Snow Empress’ Spirit and Huo Yuhao was much simpler than expected. He didn’t even feel any impact; he only felt greater strength being imbued into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just this short period of time, he clearly sensed his body being influenced by the four new soul rings. Not only did his soul power increase a notch, but his bones, passageways and spiritual power were all enhanced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enhancement to a soul master after adding four soul rings was great. Huo Yuhao’s current soul power was comparable to a Soul Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he felt that he couldn’t control his four new soul rings, the strength that they each gave him was equivalent to a thirty thousand year soul ring. This was still in the midst of the fusion, which restricted the limits of his tolerance. The Snow Lady evidently still had a lot of strength left. She was pleased after taking up the four spots. The growth potential of these soul rings was immense. It was just that Huo Yuhao was slightly displeased that the Snow Lady forcefully snatched four spots and didn’t even offer him a single soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little fellow is too domineering. What about my Ice Empress in the future!? I’ve lost four soul skills just like that—it’ll undoubtedly reduce my advantage of having twin martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he couldn’t bear to admonish her. He also believed the Ice Empress wouldn’t say anything if she were awake. No matter what form the Snow Empress took, it was still her strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One red and four orange soul rings surrounded Huo Yuhao’s body as they moved. The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s wild and barren aura disappeared. It was replaced with an elegant and peaceful aura that no one would find unusual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t feel that he had become much stronger, but the two sect masters could sense the difference in his body. With their cultivations, they felt a sense of danger from him, a sense of danger they hadn’t felt before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ke ke ke!” As a crisp and clear laugh sounded, a small and swift orange-gold figure crawled out of Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny. It was the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sect masters were surprised when they saw her appearing again. Tai Tan said, “Kid, didn’t she turn into your soul rings?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered this question on behalf of the Snow Lady. He laughed bitterly, “She didn’t turn into soul rings, but marked her territory in my body. The soul rings were just places for her to contain and consolidate her strength. She could use these four soul rings to restore her energy that was depleted. Technically, they aren’t really soul rings, and have nothing to do with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya.” The Snow Lady seemed to sense the annoyance in his voice and shook her head at him unhappily. The orange-gold light from her body became stronger and stronger. Huo Yuhao immediately sensed her intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, the first of his four new soul rings lit up. The Snow Lady lifted her hand and pointed and Tai Tan. Suddenly, a deep blue light shot out from her finger. This deep blue light started to disperse as it shot out, engulfing Tai Tan completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan turned into an ice sculpture again. He couldn’t resist it this time either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ke ke ke.” She chuckled and starting clapping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time Tai Tan was struggling even more, but his movements were much slower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s freezing me to death. Little fellow, are you using me as an experiment? This is too absurd. Be careful, or I’m going to smack your butt.” Tai Tan shivered as he tried to break out of the ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand now!” Huo Yuhao suddenly shouted, giving the two sect masters a scare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rascal, what are you shouting for? Just because I can’t bear to whack her doesn’t mean I can’t bear to whack you.” Tai Tan glared at Huo Yuhao furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t even seem to hear his threat, and said agitatedly, “I understand the secret behind Spirit. Although the Snow Lady has taken up four soul rings, they also represents four of her abilities. The secret lies in the storage of her strength within these soul rings, and that she can use them to restore her strength. All these have nothing to do with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you so happy if they have nothing to do with you?” Tai Tan asked doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “It means that the depletion of my soul and spiritual power will be very small when she unleashes her abilities. Furthermore, I don’t have to control them either! During this period of time, I can use other skills to complement her powers. We can even coordinate through our spiritual senses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sect masters were very powerful, and they immediately understood what he meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian said, “In that case, there’s now two of you with her around?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “It’s not that exaggerated. However, I believe that she can increase my fighting strength by thirty percent if she’s there to assist me or aid me in my offense. However, we need to become more familiar with each other before she’ll be able to help me effectively.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian was also surprised and said, “It’s not that simple. Since she’s connected to you and has her own thoughts, she can even leave your body to unleash her abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This Spirit is much superior to soul rings. Just like we thought, she might be able to change the relationship between soul beasts and soul masters, as well as change the cultivation of all soul masters on the continent! What you have to do next is familiarize yourself with her and discover her special characteristics. You’ll definitely also need to practice how to coordinate with her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao nodded emphatically, he was filled with excitement. When a new form of life or energy was discovered, there were too many things to explore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at the Snow Lady on his shoulder, he felt his heart soften. He sighed to himself. Who would have expected the leader of the Three Heavenly Kings in the Extreme North to end up like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five soul rings—one red and four orange—surrounded Huo Yuhao’s body. He was filled with confidence due to the unprecedented strength he had obtained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snow Lady, can you return?” He said to the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She nodded, and her face rippled with a tender glow. She turned into a streak of orange-gold light that disappeared into his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was different from the Ice Empress and Skydream Iceworm. When she entered his body, it was like coming home. She moved freely in his second mental sea and spiritual sea. She could go anywhere she wanted. He could sense where she was, but he couldn’t control her. However, he could contact her if he wanted to. They were telepathically connected in a relationship like a father and daughter.</span></p>
