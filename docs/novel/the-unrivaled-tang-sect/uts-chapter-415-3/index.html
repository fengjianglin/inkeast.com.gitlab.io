 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder brother, I…” Tai Tan rushed out of Clear Sky Castle again, looking depressed. Right now, there was still blood flowing from his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian looked a little gloomy. “Is it even possible for you to be more useless?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan’s face turned red at this moment. “Elder brother, I only used thirty percent of my abilities earlier. Who knew that this guy was so perverted? He was able to suppress my spirit and unleash a series of consecutive attacks. I initially thought that he wouldn’t be able to hurt me, even if I let him attack all he wanted. But he had some weird strength that was able to lower my spiritual and physical defenses. He’s perverted! It’s only been a few months! Why does it seem like he has changed completely?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian snorted and said, “This is the guy that our darling chose. It would be weird if he were lousy. If not for me, you would have been in deep trouble.” As he spoke, he gestured towards Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao drifted over into his arms before his aura was even revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Carrying Huo Yuhao, Niu Tian turned around and entered Clear Sky Castle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

His head was still fine, and his spiritual power wasn’t drained too much. However, his soul power had been completely over-drafted after he fully unleashed his powers at the last moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this was before he had fused with everything Wang Qiu’er gave him, the Ice Empress and Skydream Iceworm wouldn’t have dared to use such powers, his body would have collapsed completely if they did so. Even now, Huo Yuhao was still feeling extremely weak. His muscles and bones were aching, while his soul power had been completely drained. He had no energy at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where is this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in a daze as he looked at the stone ceiling. Suddenly, he felt a little lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had such a feeling every time he unleashed his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills. It was very difficult for him to recover after being so emotionally immersed. Furthermore, this symptom worsened every time he unleashed the Haodong Palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems like I really have to use the Haodong Palm more sparingly in the future,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sighed in his heart. He also slowly recalled everything that had happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This should be Clear Sky Castle? Am I inside?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He subconsciously wanted to get up, but the pain that he felt suddenly intensified. He groaned softly before laying back down. He also started to breathe more heavily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t move,” a low-pitched voice ordered. Following this, the door opened, and Niu Tian walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked at him, and subconsciously greeted him, “Uncle Niu Tian.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian didn’t acknowledge his words, but didn’t retort either. He walked to Yuhao’s bedside and watched him with his sparkling eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s hair stood on end. “Uncle Niu Tian, where’s Uncle Tai Tan? Did I defeat him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian snorted, “You really don’t know your limits! Given your abilities, how could you have defeated Tai Tan? If not for the fact that he intentionally went easier on you, he would have been able to crush you with one attack.” After he finished speaking, Niu Tian felt his face turning a little hot for some unknown reason. He was right in his description about the gap between Huo Yuhao and Tai Tan’s abilities. However, in that fight…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao instantly seemed to be in low spirits. “Uncle Niu Tian, I know that my abilities are still not good enough. I’m still far from the power that is needed to protect Dong’er. However, can I please see her? I really miss her.” His emotions had become fragile, as his body was weak. When he thought about how he and Dong’er couldn’t see each other even though they were so close, Huo Yuhao felt as if his heart had been stabbed by a knife. His sense of remembrance started to engulf him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did he always become stronger every time he unleashed his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills? Apart from the development of his abilities, it also had to do with his yearning for Wang Dong’er. He would become intoxicated and crazy, which made him stronger. Niu Tian sighed as he saw the state Huo Yuhao was in and said, “Rest first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was roused, and rushed to say, “My body is fine. Uncle Niu Tian, I can see Dong’er now.” He seemed to gather strength from some unknown place, and crawled up as he tolerated the pain that filled ihm. A dim layer of gold also surfaced on his body and supported him as he sat up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian was a little stunned. He had inspected Huo Yuhao’s body before this, and naturally knew what was going on. Huo Yuhao was able to sit up even though his body had been seriously over-drafted because he relied completely on his spiritual power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lie down and rest first. You can leave once your body is better.” Niu Tian waved his hand, and a gentle strength was transmitted into Huo Yuhao’s body. He was softly forced back down again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was anxious as he said, “Uncle Niu Tian, please let me see Dong’er.” He struggled to get up once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian said, “It’s not that I don’t want to let you see her. It’s that she’s already not here anymore. How can you see her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? She’s not here anymore? Dong’er, is Dong’er awake?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian replied, “She indeed awoke some time ago. Her father returned to treat her disease. However, it involves her brain. This is why she has forgotten everything after she woke up. She has also forgotten you. This is why you don’t have to find her anymore. Even if you do, she won’t be able to recognize you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great.” Huo Yuhao was excited, and almost jumped off his bed. However, he collapsed back onto the bed because of the prickling pain. Although he gritted his teeth in pain, his face was filled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian was perplexed as he looked at him and asked, “You are happy that Dong’er has forgotten you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “Of course not. I’m happy because she has awoken, and her disease has been treated too! I don’t believe that she has forgotten me. She couldn’t have. Even if she did, I can make her remember. Uncle Niu Tian, where is she? Please tell me. I can help her regain her memory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian’s expression turned cold, and he said, “I’ve already said that she’s no longer Wang Dong’er. I don’t know where her father has taken her, either. She’s using her old name once again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said in a daze, “Nothing else is important. It’s good to know that she’s safe and healthy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian shook his head as he looked at Huo Yuhao and answered, “A man has to have aspirations, he can’t only be burdened by relationships. Leave once you recover. If you want to know where she’s gone, ask me when you’re a Titled Douluo. Otherwise, it’ll depend on your fate with one another.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, he didn’t give Huo Yuhao a chance to ask again. He simply turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s emotions slowly stabilized after Niu Tian left. He laid down on the stone bed and kept telling himself to calm down. He could only think properly if he calmed himself down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a few important pieces of information in Niu Tian’s words earlier. Wang Dong’er had awoken and been treated. That was undoubtedly the most important thing. He had been afraid that Wang Dong’er was in a worse state than just a deep sleep, just like what Wang Qiu’er experienced. He had been afraid that she had left him forever.</span></p>

Even though he hadn’t managed to see her, he was still extremely happy and relieved right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recalled what Niu Tian had said to him earlier. From Niu Tian’s tone of voice, he could tell that Niu Tian was lying to him regarding Wang Dong’er’s condition and departure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Wang Dong’er’s condition had improved, it was undoubtedly bad news that she had lost her memories and forgotten everything that had happened between them. Furthermore, Niu Tian even mentioned that she had changed her name. She was no longer the old Wang Dong’er. If she wasn’t Wang Dong’er, who was she? What was she called now? Where did she go? Where would her father take her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these doubts appeared in Huo Yuhao’s mind.</span></p>

Niu Tian had sounded very determined. He wasn’t going to divulge where Wang Dong’er went, no matter how much Huo Yuhao pestered him. If that was the case, how was he going to find Wang Dong’er?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian only gave him two answers earlier. First, Huo Yuhao had to become a nine-ringed Titled Douluo first. That would undoubtedly mean that he possessed enough power to protect Wang Dong’er, and Niu Tian would reveal her whereabouts to him then. Next, it depended on Huo Yuhao’s fate with Wang Dong’er. However, the Douluo Continent was so huge. Would he really be able to bump into her?</span></p>

Why can’t I have this luck? I must quickly become strong and hope that luck will help me find Dong’er.</span></p>

Since Wang Dong’er was fine, he was no longer as sad and hurt as he was before. He was instantly determined to recover and follow his original plan. As he increased his abilities, he would wait for lady luck to shine on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he finished thinking, Huo Yuhao used his spiritual power to prop himself up again. He grit his teeth and sat cross-legged while bearing the pain. He activated his spiritual power and started to circulate it within his body according to his soul power circulation. He was trying to recover his drained soul power.</span></p>

His soul power slowly recovered, and started circulating through his body. The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass appeared once again. After his soul power reached a certain level, it started to guide the origin energy of heaven and earth to fuse with his body and speed up his recovery process.</span></p>

In less than six hours, his soul power recovered to its peak state, and the pain he was suffering had also disappeared.</span></p>
