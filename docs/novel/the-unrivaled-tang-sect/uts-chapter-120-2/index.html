There was nothing embarrassing about being humiliated by Elder Xuan. Although Elder Xuan had shifted the blame to him, he didn’t argue back and bore the humiliation.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both teams, please send your next competing members up to the stage. From Shrek Academy, we have Bei Bei. From the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, we have Michael. Both members, please ascend the stage.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy held the advantage now that the individual round had reached this stage. They’d even laid a solid foundation for the upcoming 2-2-3 fight.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy had only sent out a soul ancestor, Xu Sanshi, yet he’d been able to overcome 2 Class 5 soul engineers. His contributions were immense. Furthermore, one of his opponent had died, while the other had been gravely injured. They couldn’t compete in the 2-2-3 fight. This meant that Shrek Academy had already won 1 round out of the 3 rounds in the 2-2-3 fight. And they just had to win 2 rounds out of 3 in the 2-2-3 fight!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Shrek Academy had lost Xu Sanshi, their 2 soul emperors had yet to compete. Their advantage in the individual round was obvious.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Team Sun Moon’s teacher squinted his eyes, and his expression turned ghastly. However, he also knew that he couldn’t panic at this point. If they made a false move, they could lose the entire tournament. It wasn’t as if Shrek’s advantage would last forever, even though they had the upper hand right now. After all, the individual round had only just begun.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He summoned Meng Hongchen over.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Meng, everything will depend on you later. You’ll be up next. For the academy’s glory, give it your all.” The teacher said in a deep voice.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A weird radiance flashed across Meng Hongchen’s eyes as she nodded her head slightly. “Don’t worry, Teacher. I might not be able to determine the outcome, but I can definitely change the situation. I won’t let Shrek Academy have it easy.”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, we’re counting on you.” The teacher bowed slightly towards Meng Hongchen.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen pursed his lips from the other side. He was dejected, as he believed that he should be the one to turn the tables around. While his sister’s capabilities were special, and could lead to unprecedented effects, she was likely to be greatly restricted under certain conditions. Her abilities weren’t as balanced as his! However, he really was seriously injured. Even though he might be able to participate in the 2-2-3 fight, he would be useless in the individual round. Besides feeling dejected, there was nothing he could do.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei and Michael retreated to the edges of the competition stage. The Heavenfiend Douluo didn’t reveal any expression on his face as gestured and shouted, “Match, start!”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michael was an official team member, thus his powers were superior to the other 2 members before him. His abilities weren’t as simple as they’d seemed when he’d faced Jiang Peng from the Imperial Profound Academy.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately displayed his true capabilities the moment the competition began. A series of metallic clanking sounds rang out as several soul tools attached themselves to his body.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was different from his other team members. There weren’t many barrels on his body, but they were all located around his legs and back.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pair of blue, metal boots had appeared around his feet and legs. At the same time, 2 metal barrels had appeared behind his back. These 2 metal barrels were only 3 inches long, but they were more than 6 inches in diameter. The backs of these barrels were shaped like balls, which allowed them to change directions easily.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao would find it difficult to control such an advanced soul tool, as his soul power was insufficient, but Michael could easily control this soul tool, as he was a Class 5 soul engineer.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than these 2 soul tools, 4 metal wings extended from Michael’s ribs. But they were not flying-type soul tools. Rather, they were there to help him adjust his aim and maintain his balance.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, Michal there was a thick barrel on each of his arms, as well as another huge, circular, ball-like object that seemed similar to a concentrated soul tool on his chest.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei fought in a similar style to most soul masters: As soon as the start of the competition was announced, he burst forward towards his opponent as fast as possible.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Closing the gap between them was the best way that one could resist a long-distance soul engineer.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Michael also made his move, the long boots on his leg flashing with light, causing him to immediately move a few meters laterally at a frightening speed. While he wasn’t comparable to Chen An, he was not that much slower either. The soul thruster behind his back also shot out a little light as he moved laterally, although their radiance wasn’t intense. However, it still managed to increase his speed significantly, while the wings on his back automatically adjusted to maintain his balance as he moved. Huo Yuhao and He Caitou were both awed when they saw these soul tools in action. Michael truly lived up to his name as a disciple that came from the best soul engineering academy on the continent! Michael’s immaculate control of these soul tools had left them extremely amazed.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t just dodge throughout the entire fight though. He lifted his hand while he was moving, and the barrel on his right hand fired towards Bei Bei. An scarlet, oval-shaped ball of light quickly shot out into the air and flew without any rhythm. Despite its erraticness, Bei Bei remained its target. What was strange was that it didn’t let out any sound as it appeared.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei expression became serious and he stopped in his tracks. He waved his right hand and unleashed his Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon, his first soul ring shining brightly. He then used his Thunderous Dragon Claw to grab the ball of light.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was imperative for Bei Bei to understand what the offensive capabilities of his opponent were, based off of the 2 soul cannons on his opponent’s arms.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He managed to precisely grab the orange-red light ball, but a strange scene appeared.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lightning from the Thunderous Dragon Claw was extinguished as soon as it made contact with the orange-red light ball. The ball of light stopped in mid-air, then began to shine even more brightly than before.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou had already stood up below the stage. He said in horror, “That’s an automatic soul cannon! To think they actually had something like this…”</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had once heard Fan Yu’s description of such a soul tool. It was a powerful soul tool that Shrek Academy didn’t possess.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once an automatic soul cannon was fired, the cannon shell would absorb all surrounding energy, then become explosive once it struck its opponent or was blocked. The scariest thing was that it could be also be detonated at any time.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This meant that Michael could make it so that the cannon shell only detonated a few seconds after it was touched. Generally speaking, it would explode between one and five seconds after contact. After all, a cannon shell was a high-energy entity compressed from soul power; it couldn’t be controlled for too long.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But many things could still be decided within this period of time!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the case now. When he saw the sudden increase in the intensity of the light, Bei Bei had no choice but to stop and leap to the side.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scarlet ball of light exploded after a second, its frighteningly explosive force creating a burning, scarlet circle of light with a diameter of more than one and a half meters, and an even greater explosive strength, to appear. The light caused the air within a 3 meter radius to distort wherever it passed.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei turned pale and wanted to curse. This soul tool was too powerful. He was likely to be critically injured if he was struck head-on even once!</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, the automatic soul cannon fired at a rather slow speed due to its great power, as a huge amount of soul power had to be gathered before the cannon could be fired.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the first cannon shell exploded, Michael’s second cannon shell had only just been fired from the barrel on his other hand.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of soul tool was very useful, but the heat that it generated could easily cause the barrel to crack, and couldn’t be fired repeatedly. As such, Michael chose to fire with the other barrel. Ma Rulong had mentioned before that close-combat wasn’t his forte. These automatic soul cannons that had appeared in this tournament for the first time were his true trump cards. Of course, there was also the scarlet ball that started to light up in front of his chest; it was bound to be something powerful too!</span></p>
