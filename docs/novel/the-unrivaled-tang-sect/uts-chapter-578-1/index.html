 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling was completely decked in armor. Although Huo Yuhao didn’t know how old she was, he was still in awe.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had gained the upper hand in their first clash. The strength of his Darkgolden Terrorclaw suppressed Feng Ling’s Phoenix Claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them seemed to have great chemistry with each other. They leapt into the sky at almost the same time and transformed into two different projections. Instantly, they shot more than a thousand meters into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky was a battlefield for truly strong individuals. Otherwise, everything on the ground would be torn apart from the shockwaves generated during an intense clash between powerful individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were a hundred meters away from each other. They continued to rise into the sky. No emotional undulations appeared in Feng Ling’s eyes. She only glared at Huo Yuhao. Just as she was rising, her own stature was also growing rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t any inferior. Dark-blue projections flashed around his body. The higher it was, the colder the air temperature. The number of ice elements also increased. With the help of the Icy War God’s Armor, these ice elements were quickly absorbed into his body before they were turned into a part of his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying soul power undulations rippled through the air. The fight between them immediately reached a peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sharp phoenix cry sounded. In mid-air, Feng Ling opened her wings once again. Behind her, the sky instantly turned purplish-black. At the same time, a giant dark phoenix surfaced amidst the purplish-black. Its appearance was very subtle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s Phoenix was agile, elegant and holy. Feng Ling’s Phoenix was sinister and evil! It seemed like it wanted to crush the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang!” A strange pop could be heard from around Feng Ling’s body. Her first soul ring also popped. The evil energy around her, which was already very strong, started to grow many times stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Her soul skill is different from before.” Yan Shaozhe muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had once had a relationship with Feng Ling. Back then, Feng Ling already had six rings, even though she wasn’t as strong as she was right now. The soul skills that she demonstrated then were quite different from her soul skills right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “It must be a mutation after her Evil Phoenix awakened. As her martial soul mutated, her soul skills also mutated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something that had happened to Xu Sanshi and Bei Bei. Generally speaking, a mutation of a martial soul would lead to mutations in soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe said, “I’m afraid Yuhao has underestimated his opponent this time. Feng Ling is already so strong. Zhong Liwu must be even stronger than her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile surfaced on Elder Xuan’s face, “While Feng Ling is strong, Yuhao is no longer the same as before either. Today, he’ll prove to everyone that he’s one of the strongest in the world now. Shaozhe, he’s already exceeded you in terms of cultivation and fighting strength. While Feng Ling is strong, she’s still worse than you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was astonished. He hadn’t expected Elder Xuan to have such a high opinion of Huo Yuhao. It was also at this moment that Huo Yuhao experienced a transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his body as the center, a ball of blurry blue light shone in the air. At the start, it was deep-blue. However, as it spread, it turned dimmer and dimmer. When it had spread more than a hundred meters, it had turned completely white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This white was in great contrast with the purplish-black that Feng Ling had unleashed. The white started to scatter and turn into countless snowflakes, that twisted and turned in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snowflakes were pure-white, and carried a holy aura. When Feng Ling’s evil energy spread towards Huo Yuhao, the snowflakes were stirred, but they easily dispelled the evil energy. The evil energy couldn’t get close to Huo Yuhao at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very start, it felt as if Feng Ling had gained the upper hand. Her evil energy engulfed most of the region, and even engulfed the position that Huo Yuhao was standing in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this changed very soon. The snowflakes around Huo Yuhao’s body were continuously and steadily expanding. No matter how much Feng Ling tried to summon her evil energy, she couldn’t breach the region covered by Huo Yuhao’s snowflakes. Her strength was suppressed and forced back by the falling snowflakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, she had wanted to use her evil energy to influence Huo Yuhao. However, she was the one who was being influenced right now. Although she wasn’t engulfed within his domain, the air temperature was still falling dramatically. Given her cultivation, she was still horrified when subjected to such a low temperature. The circulation of her soul power seemed to be affected too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimate Ice is actually so terrifying?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eternal Domain of Perpetual Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had shut his eyes. Every snowflake he felt was like a part of his feelings and emotions. They kept on extending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil energy that Feng Ling unleashed was very strong and pure. Normally, she wouldn’t be at a disadvantage even when up against his Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice was no longer like it was before. After he completed the fusion of his second soul core, his Ultimate Ice reached an entirely new tier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strongest point of the Yin Yang Complement was that ‘Yin’ was in ‘Yang’ and ‘Yang’ was in ‘Yin’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was many times greater than before after it combined Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Douluo spiritual power and the compressed, extremely low temperature of his Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t allow this to continue!” Feng Ling immediately judged. If Huo Yuhao continued to suppress her using his domain, she would be in a far worse position as time passed. Since she was losing in the aspect of elements, she could only rely on pure fighting strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her pitch-black seventh soul ring suddenly shone. Thick purplish-black light instantly devoured her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, purplish-black clouds separated in the sky, and a giant purplish-black phoenix rushed out. It carried a dazzling purplish-black tail flame and brought strange ripples as it charged towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she was suppressed by the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, Feng Ling finally resorted to using her Martial Soul True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From afar, her phoenix seemed to be very elegant and dazzling. However, it had a pair of blood-red eyes, which completely destroyed any elegance it might have possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wherever this phoenix passed, the air would distort tremendously. There seemed to be countless, pathetic screams echoing around the purplish glow that came from the phoenix, and fierce-looking faces could be subtly seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was the evil part of this Evil Phoenix? It was through devouring other soul masters! The Evil Phoenix devoured the martial souls of other soul masters to improve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Comparatively speaking, Feng Ling had killed very little compared to other evil soul masters. This was because she had to devour a martial soul that was similar to her own. Furthermore, it was only effective if the other party had a roughly similar cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why she had wanted to devour Yan Shaozhe’s martial soul when she first experienced her awakening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the aura of her martial soul was fully unleashed, she became even keener to devour martial souls. Even though Huo Yuhao had an Ultimate martial soul, he was still affected. A fear that originated from his martial soul caused him to waver a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao drifted within his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. Against Feng Ling’s attack, he didn’t immediately unleash his True Body to resist it. Instead, he maintained his domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling was about to crash into his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. A Transcendent Douluo’s True Body was extremely terrifying, especially when she fully demonstrated her ability to devour. Feng Ling had absolute confidence that she could break Huo Yuhao’s domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression was very serious. Suddenly, he made a hugging motion. Immediately, the snowflakes in his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice gathered towards his body. They were moving directly towards his palms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling’s True Body stopped in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s given up on his domain? Don’t tell me he’s going to unleash his True Body too?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first thought that arose in her mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this, Feng Ling was in front of Huo Yuhao. A strong force of evil swept towards him. The Evil Phoenix True Body already had its mouth wide open, and was about to devour Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao still didn’t unleash his True Body. He drifted in mid-air, as still as a statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Icy War God’s Armor unleashed intense dark-blue light. Huo Yuhao gradually pushed his right hand out to resist Feng Ling’s Evil Phoenix True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a clash between large and small. Right now, the difference between Huo Yuhao and Feng Ling appeared to be very great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What is he doing? He’s actually not avoiding the True Body of a Transcendent Douluo or unleashing his own True Body to resist? Is he really so confident?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as everyone was puzzled, Feng Ling suddenly stopped in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her gigantic True Body stopped in the air just like that. Following this, it was clear that a trace of icy-blue was spreading to the rest of the Evil Phoenix’s body from its head.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He, he’s actually frozen Little Feng’s True Body? What strength is this? Even an Ultimate Douluo couldn’t possibly be so strong, right? Little Feng’s Evil Phoenix is considered one of the strongest among evil soul masters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, Huo Yuhao had only used his Snowless Glacier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength of his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was tapped by his soul core. He instantly compressed and gathered it before unleashing it using his Snowless Glacier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling felt it the most. She felt that she wasn’t just facing a palm, but a giant whirlpool of ice and snow. It was just that this whirlpool was formless. Her immense soul power was actually frozen by this formless Ultimate Ice. She was unable to move, and could only sense a terrifying chill engulfing her entire body.</span></p>
