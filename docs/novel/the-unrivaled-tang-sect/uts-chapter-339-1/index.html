At least the reward that we’ve offered is not wasted. I’ll guide him well in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Wan laughed and said, “Third Elder, don’t try to pull that trick on me. I noticed this kid first. Spiritual calling is my thing. You already have so many disciples, but I don’t even have one who’ll inherit everything that I have. I’ve already discussed this with the vice-founder. The tournament is an additional test for him. I want to him accept him as my inheriting disciple. Otherwise, why would I have asked the vice-founder to find this Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell? I’ve already spent a lot of money. There’s no way you can snatch him from me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder snorted and said, “Don’t forget, he’s an outstanding soul engineer. He shouldn’t be older than twenty-four or twenty-five years old, but he’s already as good as a Class 6 soul engineer. If we continue to nurture him, he’ll definitely become a Class 9 soul engineer. The founder also mentioned before that the future will belong to soul engineers. While his soul master cultivation is pretty decent, he can’t give up on soul tools. Why don’t we both accept him as a disciple?” He knew he couldn’t win against his second brother, and thus he offered an alternative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Wan pondered for a moment before saying, “It’s a plausible idea. However, he can only be my Inheriting Disciple. It’s fine if you want to teach him some stuff, but we’ll have to see whether his spiritual power is sufficient. Soul engineers will be the trend in the future, but soul masters are stronger for now. I’ve discovered that many academies have realized how important it is to combine both soul masters and soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder snapped, “Second brother, you are really calculating. You’re asking me to teach him, but he’s going to be your inheriting disciple? Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Wan laughed and said, “Alright, alright. You must understand how I feel, too. When I accept him as my disciple, I’ll get him to return the Darkness Green Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Nangong Wan’s words, Mocke looked very delighted and hurriedly said, “Thank you, senior uncle!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Wan furrowed his brow when he looked at him and said, “Even if the Darkness Green Dragon returns, you don’t have the authority to possess it right now. You are too impatient; you’ll need to train for a few years first. When we return, you should learn how to develop soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Ke was stunned for a moment, then turned dismal. He looked at the Third Elder and softly said, “Teacher…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder snorted, “Your second senior uncle is giving you a chance this time. If you left it up to me, I’d confiscate the Darkness Green Dragon from you forever. Hmph!”</span></p>

The Duskwater Alliance was the strongest of the three underground organizations, and thus they weren’t too bothered with causing trouble as they rushed to their destination, charging along all the way there. The ordinary citizens avoided them when they saw the symbol on their carriages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were shut all the while. He didn’t move at all. He Caitou also didn’t make a sound as he sat beside Huo Yuhao. Huang Zheng didn’t try to start a conversation with them when he saw how they were composing themselves. Compared to the other carriage, they were much quieter. The carriage they were in also greatly reduced incoming external sound, and thus it was completely silent in their carriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, was Huo Yuhao really calm despite the silence? It was the exact opposite. Right now, he was trying to gather his spiritual power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea, he had entered a miraculous state. Waves were surging furiously in his vast spiritual sea. The “seawater” had turned golden-silver after he completed the Second Awakening of his body soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time the seawater rose, the waves that it conjured stopped slightly. A two-colored whirlpool would also appear occasionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the seawater rose, a white ball of light emitting a dim glow condensed in mid-air. This ball wasn’t completely circular, but oval, like an egg. It was filled with the aura of life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a few figures drifting atop the water’s surface in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress still held the image of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. However, her body was a hundred feet long in this spiritual sea. Her dazzling diamond ice crystals and azure-green tail were very splendid and eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eight-to-nine-year-old Snow Empress was standing beside the Ice Empress. She was already very pretty at this age. Her long, white dress was completely spotless, and she wore a captivating smile on her face. Occasionally, she would get closer to the Ice Empress and whisper a few words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress wasn’t the largest figure. That was the Skydream Iceworm, who was lazily lying down in the spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power came mainly from the Skydream Iceworm. It was his presence that gave him everything that his Spirit Eyes possessed. Although his spiritual power had increased to an extremely high level, his compatibility with the Skydream Iceworm was still very high. The Skydream Iceworm was very comfortable as he lay in Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Skydream Iceworm was in a rather bad mood right now. As he stole glances at the Snow and Ice Empresses, he felt a little indignant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the ordeal that happened in the past, the Snow Empress had turned into a Spirit, and he entered deep sleep with the Ice Empress. It was also at that point in time that his relationship with the Ice Empress got a little closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Ice Empress still seemed a little harsh, like she had been in the past, after she awoke. Even though the Snow Empress had lost most of her memories, she remained close to the Ice Empress instead of bothering with him. How could he not be depressed seeing that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Skydream, is it fine for Huo Yuhao to be like this? Will he be in any danger?” The Ice Empress’ voice was very captivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm lazily replied, “He’ll be fine. His spiritual realm has reached the stage I was in at my strongest state. He has also fused with my spiritual power. Right now, the problem he has is that his body can’t handle his spiritual power. He won’t lack for power. He’s just using his spiritual power to do things right now, and not directly attacking anyone. He’ll be fine. He’s only isolating a part of it right now. Even if it doesn’t come back, it won’t harm him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress snorted and said, “You don’t seem to be anxious at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm replied, “Eh, I don’t even want to live anymore. What’s there to be anxious about? Even if something happens to him, I’ll just die with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress was stunned for a moment. “Don’t want to live anymore? There’s no one in this world who knows this logic better than you; better a bad life than a good death! You’ve already lived for a million years, but you are still entertaining such a thought?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm almost spat out blood. “Ice, can’t you treat me better? After all, we are of opposite genders!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing will happen between you and the Snow Empress. Why are you still pestering her? I’ve treated you so well. Let me tell you, I don’t have anyone else that I like. I’ve already turned into Yuhao’s Spirit. I’ve felt this Spirit before. Even if something happens to me, it won’t affect Yuhao. Since you are so cold towards me, I might actually seek death one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress snapped, “Don’t pull this trick on me! Don’t think that I’ll like you just because you were being very righteous and brave then! Look at your foolishness! Iceworms were born to be the food of Ice Jade Scorpions! You and I can never be together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm didn’t reply after hearing the Ice Empress’ words. He lazily turned his head and didn’t utter a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a slight tremble of emotion in the Ice Empress’ eyes. She lifted her tail to slap the spiritual sea. She seemed to be venting and exerting her dominance over the Skydream Iceworm. However, she didn’t do anything to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow! Why should I like him? I’m an elegant Ice Jade Empress Scorpion.
