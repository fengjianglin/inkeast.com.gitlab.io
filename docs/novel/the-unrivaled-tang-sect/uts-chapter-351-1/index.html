They weren’t afraid of Tang Wu on the competition stage, they were afraid of the five formidable evil soul masters beneath the arena, who were just standing there spookily. They were no longer masking their auras!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An evil soul master who was still so young was already so horrifying; he had defeated and murdered that girl, who had an Angel martial soul and possessed the holy element, and swallowed her up entirely. If that was the case, then what kind of abilities did these stronger evil soul masters possess?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded at Ye Yulin and said, “Since I’ve won, then please give me the prize, chief judge.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shadows appeared one after another beside Huo Yuhao; the Holy Ghost Church’s vice-founder had taken her four elders onto the competition stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder stared at Ye Yulin with a sinister look in her eyes. She didn’t say anything, but the aura that was rising from her body caused Ye Yulin to recoil in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Transcendent Douluo!

He raised his voice and said, “The Radiant City Elite Soul Engineering Tournament’s championship belongs to the Duskwater Alliance. From this moment onwards, our wager is complete. An Litong, Shangguan Wei’er, what else do you have to say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elders from the other two underground organizations were already on their feet at this point. An Litong wore a black face, and he wanted to retort, but he ultimately held himself back as he surveyed the five mighty evil soul masters on the competition stage. He shook his head painfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shangguan Wei’er’s dainty face seemed a little slack as her eyes were filled with agony. Ye Guyi’s death had dealt a heavy blow to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nangong Wan said proudly, “Alright, since there’s nothing else you wish to say, then we will proceed according to the tournament’s rules. Come to the Duskwater Alliance’s headquarters tomorrow, and we will have a thorough follow-up discussion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An Litong snorted coldly before he turned and led his company away. Shangguan Wei’er’s face suddenly became vengeful as she shot a hateful glare at Huo Yuhao, before she also turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tournament was over, concluded in such a shocking and breathtaking fashion, and the aristocrats, the audience, and even the gamblers who had won some money hurriedly got to their feet and swiftly disappeared, one after another. They really didn’t want to see that horrifying devil hidden underneath his human-shaped soul tool. Yes, Huo Yuhao was no different from the devil in their eyes at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s prizes were laid out one by one in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rare metals were placed in front of him, ton after ton, and then there was the insurmountable Class 9 soul tool, the Sunmoon Divine Needle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sunmoon Divine Needle was actually two ring-shaped soul tools, one larger than the other. The first ring was about one and a half meters in diameter, while the smaller one was roughly one meter in diameter. The larger one was golden, and the smaller one was silver. Sophisticated patterns were engraved all over their surface, and even Huo Yuhao felt a little dizzy just looking at it, even though he could be considered a Class 7 soul engineer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin heaved a sigh and passed the Sunmoon Divine Needle to Huo Yuhao. He lowered his voice and said, “You need to have at least eight soul rings before you can use it. Otherwise, you won’t be able to control it at all, and you won’t even have enough soul power to support it. Don’t attempt to break and copy my soul tool, because it will rip your body into a million pieces. That’s all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin paused after this. The Starsky Douluo couldn’t control himself in the end, and asked, “I’m quite interested in your human-shaped soul tool’s structure. If you’re willing, you can sell its blueprint to me. The price can be negotiated This is how you can contact me.” He passed Huo Yuhao a card as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Huo Yuhao said nothing more and took the card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou had arrived beside Huo Yuhao, and his shoulder touched Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. Huo Yuhao turned around and glanced at him, and a faint smile appeared on He Caitou’s face. Five mighty evil soul masters had sealed away every possible escape path beside them at this moment, and every single evil soul master had satisfied smiles on their faces besides the vice-founder, whose facial expression was masked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled as well, except his smile was hidden inside his human-shaped soul tool.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s almost time.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless metal fragments flew in all directions. However, the reinforced underground palace didn’t quake too much. Some of the rare metals that were closer to the warehouse’s first gate scattered across the ground, triggering several soul rays that fired off randomly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Guozhong dispelled the smoke in front of him with a somber look on his face. The soul rays were blocked by an invisible barrier a meter from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The underground warehouse’s defense system was established too perfectly, so much so that it had taken them an exceedingly long time to destroy the various booby traps before they could attempt to break down the first floor’s main gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t hard to imagine how many losses they had already incurred, and the repairs would also cost a tremendous amount of money and time. But Xu Guzhong had no choice, as he had to enter the underground warehouse as quickly as possible so that he could take stock and calculate his losses. Furthermore, nobody else could know about this episode; they would have to try their best to keep this a secret! Otherwise, it wouldn’t be too difficult for the crown prince, Xu Tianran, to impeach him! He would be in real trouble if that happened...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Powerful soul rays erupted from behind Xu Guozhong’s back in a tight volley, and his soul engineers destroyed all the soul tools on the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of the Class 8 soul engineers said, “It seems like the booby traps and the defense mechanisms are alright. They can still be triggered, which means they’re still operational. Let me scout ahead, my Lord.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Guozhong’s complexion became a little better at this show of his subordinate’s loyalty. He nodded gently and said, “Be careful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The Class 8 soul engineer stepped into the warehouse routinely and easily as he swiftly checked out the situation on the first floor. His voice quickly came back from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Lord, nothing has been stolen from the first floor, but the gate leading to the second floor has been destroyed. All the traps and defense mechanisms are intact, and they don’t seem like they’ve been triggered. It seems like somebody familiar with our place has done this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Guozhong led his company forward, avoiding the miscellaneous traps as they quickly advanced to the gate leading to the second floor. He saw the metal dust and fragments strewn all over the ground, and bent down and pinched some in his fingers to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Guozhong was a Class 9 soul engineer, so it wasn’t hard to imagine how familiar he was with metal. His expression quickly changed as he muttered, “These particles have lost all metallic elements, as if they’re just dust. How is that possible? This gate was made from more than ten different alloys, and the gate itself possessed a protective soul barrier. Breaking it down should have triggered the alarm. How did the intruders accomplish this? Li Chong is the mole!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a clear judgment in his head. Li Chong was nowhere to be seen, while the traps and defense mechanisms outside hadn’t been triggered, and only certain setups and mechanisms had been destroyed all the way inside. This would be impossible unless the intruders were familiar with this place, so Li Chong was the prime suspect; he fit the bill, and he had been standing guard before this, too!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A vindictive look flickered across Xu Guozhong’s eyes as he lowered his voice and said, “On to the second floor.” The second floor was where the most precious metals were kept!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Xu Guozhong wasn’t that worried anymore. In the end, most rare metals were very dense and heavy, so thieves couldn’t take that much away even if they had storage-type soul tools for transport. These losses wouldn’t be much to the colossal warehouse, compared to the inventory they had accumulated over so many years. Xu Guozhong was confident in his ability to keep this incident quiet if they didn’t lose too much...</span></p>

The piles of rare metals that were originally neatly arranged had disappeared in enormous patches, and his estimate of his losses reached a horrendous level even before he was only ten meters in.</span></p>

He must have planned this. He’s stolen the most valuable metals!” Xu Guozhong’s face was so somber it felt like his emotions were dripping down his face.</span></p>

His losses were far greater than his original estimations, and they couldn’t be measured with money at this point. This was especially true because several rare metals had completely disappeared. Among them was the Diamond Essencegold; they hadn’t even had one ton of it in this warehouse, and now not a single speck of it remained!</span></p>

My Lord, the third floor’s gate has been opened.” One of his subordinate’s voices could be heard from far away. Xu Guozhong suddenly felt a little lightheaded, and he nearly fainted.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The third floor’s gate has been opened?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An extremely ominous feeling swiftly rose from his heart.</span></p>

What helped him relax a little was that soul tools missing from the third floor’s immense and vast storage space weren’t so obvious.</span></p>

Steal them, bastard! You’re so good, eh! Why didn’t you take them all away?!” Xu Guozhong bellowed hysterically.
