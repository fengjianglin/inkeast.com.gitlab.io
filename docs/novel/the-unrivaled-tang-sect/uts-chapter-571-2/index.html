 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen shouted almost without hesitation. He commanded everyone to stop attacking. However, every soul tool was currently being unleashed at full power as the hundreds of soul engineers did their best to muster the greatest of their offensive ability. How far could his voice travel? No one heard him. Everyone was frantically and furiously attacking. There was only one thought in their heads – decimate all the spectral creatures in front of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The situation was a little out of control right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen tried to knock a few soul engineers down. However, these soul engineers immediately jumped up after they were knocked down. After they jumped up, they continued attacking. Unless they were knocked out, they wouldn’t stop at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a frantic attack only slowly ceased after five minutes, when there were not many spectral creatures left to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen and Xu Tianyuan both looked very glum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While soul engineers were well-respected in the army, they were still soldiers in the end. The duty of soldiers was to listen to orders. Once soldiers stopped listening to orders, it meant that the entire army was out of control. That was the most terrifying thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the soul engineers that stopped, their fear slowly vanished as they were excited. They had completely killed all the spectral creatures. There was even no sight of any broken limbs on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all of them were very fatigued as their fear disappeared. Many of them dropped to the ground panting. This was the after-effect of over-excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, they might not be physically exhausted, but they were certainly mentally exhausted!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen suddenly thought of something, and his figure flashed. He rushed towards the few soul engineers among the legion who were in charge of surveillance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was a pity that he was still a step too slow. A soul engineer who was in charge of surveillance subconsciously exclaimed, “Why, why are there still so many spectral creatures outside?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen shut him up. However, he had already said something that he shouldn’t have before Xia Xuanchen could cover his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul engineers who were both excited and fatigued right now were immediately stunned when they heard his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There’s more? There’s more of them?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What about the hard work that they had put in earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A deeper fear than before immediately swept over them at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few soul engineers who were weaker and greatly drained from earlier suffered mental breakdowns. They charged towards the outside of the protective soul barrier as they screamed frantically. They were trying to flee. All of their faces were contorted at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang, bang, bang, bang…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul rays shot out accurately. Headshot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first six soul engineers who had charged out immediately collapsed into a pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the soul engineers subconsciously turned their attention to where the soul rays came from. They only saw the grim-looking Xu Tianyuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Silence! Whoever dares to rebel shall be killed.” Xu Tianyuan’s cold voice could be heard by every soul engineer. This also roused their fear of military discipline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianyuan raised his right hand, and a completely jade-blue soul cannon shell appeared in his hand. “What’s there to be frantic about? All of you are useless. Have you forgotten who you are? Who are we? We are part of the Hand that Protects the Nation of the Sun Moon Empire. We are a beast lord-ranked soul engineer legion, a strength to behold. No matter what enemy we face, they can only submit to us. What’s there to fear? Do you see this? Do you see what’s in my hand? It’s a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So what if there’s another attack like earlier, but only ten or hundred times stronger? We can easily destroy them. Are all of you scared just because they’re ugly spectral creatures?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Observe, watch closely. See how many spectral creatures will survive this time.” As he spoke, Xu Tianyuan’s hand flashed with light again, and a giant cannon appeared on his shoulder. A vice-legion commander personally inserted the jade-blue shell into the cannon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianyuan didn’t even deliberately aim. As a jade-blue light shone, the shell immediately shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the forest in the distance, a terrifying jade-blue light brightened the entire sky. A massive wave of energy swept over them, and it seemed like the entire world had turned jade-blue at this instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The detector in the observer’s hand revealed that more than a third of the red spots had disappeared. No traces were left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the strength of a top-grade shell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul engineers’ morale and sense of fear slowly returned to normal as the jade-blue light flashed. The soul engineers lowered their heads. They stood up and repented for their behavior earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen silently heaved a sigh of relief, and gave a thumbs-up to Xu Tianyuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xu Tianyuan knew things weren’t all that smooth. Earlier, he shouldn’t have used that Class 9 shell no matter what. Those spectral creatures were only summoned by evil soul masters. They weren’t capable of finding the evil soul masters. The Class 9 shell would only serve to make their enemies more prudent, and therefore more difficult to deal with in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, did he have a choice? The morale of his troops had been very low, and they were about to carry out a mutiny. He couldn’t think of a better way to react to the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he didn’t know was that Huo Yuhao was a little unsettled right now. He hadn’t expected the other party to use a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, his Spiritual Detection covered the entire place. He felt that things weren’t right when Xu Tianyuan took out the Class 9 shell. He immediately ordered his spectral army to divide into two files and retreat to the sides of the trajectory that the shell was moving in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, his spectral army still sustained heavy losses. Of course, both he and Tang Wutong managed to hide far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao had gained the upper hand in this confrontation, his advantage was greatly reduced after the other party unleashed a Class 9 shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao had a Class 9 shell with him too. However, he couldn’t bear to use it. He would not touch it unless the situation was truly desperate. It was simply too valuable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s gone all-out by using a Class 9 shell.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a moment of temporary shock, Huo Yuhao quickly calmed himself down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The enemy chose to use a Class 9 shell even when he wasn’t supposed to use it no matter the circumstance. What did that signify? It meant that the enemy had lost a little control after being subjected to pressure by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six soul engineer legions who had attempted to flee earlier were the best proof. Since this was the case, Huo Yuhao was bent on applying more pressure. Furthermore, he was going to try another method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Huo Yuhao’s orders, the spectral army quickly retreated. The destructiveness of a Class 9 shell was simply too terrifying. Any living creature would be decimated under such an attack. Even an Ultimate Douluo wouldn’t dare to directly resist the strength of a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To prevent sustaining more losses, Huo Yuhao commanded his spectral army to cease attacking. After all, did he only have one strategy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was crucial to remember that he wasn’t just a powerful Titled Douluo. He was also a Class 9 soul engineer. As a soul engineer, he was very familiar with the abilities of a soul engineer. For example, a linked defensive barrier might be able to isolate energy and spiritual attacks, but it couldn’t isolate the effects of temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While temperature was also a form of energy, the difference was that it could be conducted in many ways apart from air. It was almost impossible to completely isolate temperature changes. At least, it wasn’t plausible based on current soul tool technology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re gone. The spectral creatures have vanished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rapturous cheers sounded within the protective soul barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianyuan really heaved a sigh of relief this time. At the same time, he felt very proud of himself. The enemy had finally retreated after he used a Class 9 shell. Did this also mean that their attacks would cease? Yes! How many people could remain composed in the face of a Class 9 shell? If the shell killed a portion of their enemies earlier, it would be even more perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen also appeared much more relaxed. He came to Xu Tianyuan’s side and whispered, “Brother Xu, let everyone rest first. We can’t leave in such a state.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Xu Tianyuan nodded. The earlier outburst had caused many of the soul engineers earlier to be greatly drained, whether it was in terms of their spiritual or soul power. They couldn’t possibly leave without resting. At the same time, they needed to observe the situation further to determine whether their enemies had really retreated.</span></p>
