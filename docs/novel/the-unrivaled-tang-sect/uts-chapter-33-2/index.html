 <p><strong>Book 6: Graduating</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 33.2: Two Soul Bones</strong></p>
 <p>Zhou Yi was instantly astonished. “This is...? Is this the prize the school gave you?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s trio simultaneously nodded.</p>
 <p>A trace of excitement appeared in Zhou Yi’s eyes. “It’s no wonder that Director Du was being so secretive. He’d actually planned to give you something as valuable as this. What soul bone is this?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao gave her a brief explanation of its abilities, and told her that they planned to give it to Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi nodded. “You’re all good kids! You have to know, even Soul Emperor—or even Soul Douluo-ranked experts—would find it hard to remain calm when they were facing a soul bone! I’m only giving you another soul bone because you deserve it. Do you still remember that match you guys had with Ning Tian, Wu Feng, and Nanmen Yun’er? During that match, I made a bet with their teacher; that’s how I won this soul bone. It’s a relatively poor quality soul bone, but it has the ability to fuse with other soul bones. If you can find two more soul bones that have similar attributes to this one, you can fuse them together with this one. It’s a priceless treasure to someone who needs it, but the chances of you being able able to obtain two other soul bones with similar attributes to this one are simply too small. Thus, I’d suggest you fuse with it right away. It’s a left arm bone, and it’s known as the Secret Law Soul’s Left Arm Bone. Actually... this can’t really be considered a true soul bone, as it wasn’t produced by a single soul beast.”</p>
 <p>“This Secret Law Soul Bone was obtained through a special, yet brutal method. To obtain a single Secret Law Soul Bone, one has to kill a hundred soul beasts of the same type within an hour, then use a secret technique to activate all of their soul rings at the same time. Even then, there’s only a 10% chance that it will produce this soul bone. It’s a relatively simple method of obtaining a soul bone, but due to its low success rate and brutality, very few soul masters do it. If you directly fuse with it, it’ll increase your soul power by 5%. It doesn’t sound like much, but this increase will always be there, regardless of your cultivation rank. Once your cultivation rank has increased, its effects will become much more obvious.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao received the leather bag that Zhou Yi gave him, then turned to Wang Dong. However, Wang Dong immediately faced away from him. “Don’t look at me, I don’t want it. Don’t you think that it’s a little bit too ordinary for me?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt touched when he saw Wang Dong’s seemingly arrogant expression. Naturally, he knew that Wang Dong was deliberately doing this to give the soul bone to him. It was just as he’d previously said to Xiao Xiao; it’d be no big deal to split it among themselves if they obtained one in the future. However, obtaining a soul bone was easier said than done! At the same time, who knew when they’d get another soul bone?</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s cheek became rosy under the rays of the sun, which added a faint layer of light to his face. Although he’d turned away, Huo Yuhao could still see the determination in his eyes. He could sense that Wang Dong was trying to make up for the injustices he’d suffered, thus he didn’t refuse the soul bone again. He carefully put the Secret Law Soul’s soul bone away while burying the feelings of brotherly love deep in his heart. Sometimes, the love between brothers wasn’t said out loud, but shown through actions.</p>
 <p>“En, this soul bone will be quite useful. Let’s hang onto it for now, I’ll help you use it soon.” The Skydream Iceworm’s voice rang out in Huo Yuhao’s mind without any prior warning, jolting him.</p>
 <p>“Brother Skydream.” Hearing its voice, Huo Yuhao immediately felt as if he’d seen a close relative of his. The grievances he’d suppressed for so long immediately exploded out, causing his eyes to turn somewhat red. However, Zhou Yi, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao naturally assumed that he’d been moved by Wang Dong’s actions.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm spoke unhappily, “Little Yuhao, don’t feel so down. You naturally have this brother supporting you. Those humans are so short-sighted, thinking that this brother’s soul ring is a ten year one. Humph, you don’t have to worry. In a few years, I’ll make them tremble when they see this ten year soul ring. I’m going to repeat this again—quickly raise your soul power to Rank 20. When that time comes, I’ll make sure that no one dares to look down on you.”</p>
 <p>“En, I’ll definitely get to Rank 20 as quickly as possible. I’ll definitely get there before I graduate from Year 1.” The tension in his heart had disappeared, but he still felt a sense of urgency from not being able to become a core disciple. With his current cultivation, it was definitely hard to say whether or not he could continue his studies within Shrek Academy.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi said, “Wang Dong, go back with Xiao Xiao first. I have some things I need to say to Huo Yuhao.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong looked towards Huo Yuhao, his large, beautiful eyes full of encouragement. He waved his fist towards Huo Yuhao, then walked away with Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi walked over to Huo Yuhao and grabbed his arm with her right hand. Immediately afterwards, Huo Yuhao once again experienced the feeling of flying through the clouds.</p>
 <p>Not long afterwards, Zhou Yi stopped. To his astonishment, Huo Yuhao discovered that they’d arrived back at the Soul Tool Testing Area. This place had left a deep impression on him the last time he’d come here; it’d also solidified his wish to study the creation and utilisation of soul tools. At this moment, he naturally knew what returning here signified.</p>
 <p>“Teacher Zhou, is Teacher Fan Yu willing to accept me as his disciple?” Huo Yuhao asked, a trace of surprise present in his voice.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi nodded slightly. “You’re a smart child. However, I must warn you. Because you’re a first year, your current cultivation puts you in a very dangerous position. The minimum requirement to become a second year student is to have two soul rings, thus you’ll have to get your second one by the end of your first year. I don’t have any objections towards you cultivating the art of soul tools along with you continuing your studies in the Martial Soul Department, but you still need to have a good foundation in the field of martial souls, even if you decide to specialise in soul tools in the future. As such, you’ll have to manage your time rationally.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi brought Huo Yuhao into the Soul Tool Testing Area as she spoke.</p>
 <p>The sturdy-bodied Fan Yu quickly walked over to them when they walked in. Compared to the cold and stern face he’d had last time, the current Fan Yu had a much gentler expression on his face. He took the initiative to pat Huo Yuhao on the shoulder and said, “I watched the finals of your freshmen assessment. It was extremely brilliant, you did very well.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi looked at Fan Yu with a somewhat stupefied look on her face. Although she seemed like a strict person on the outside, she was actually a warm-hearted person on the inside. On the other hand, she understood Fan Yu’s personality very well; he was a person who rarely complimented other people, and was also incomparably arrogant on the inside. Huo Yuhao was only a first year student, therefore it was no small thing for him to be praised so highly by Fan Yu.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Teacher Fan Yu.” Huo Yuhao greeted Fan Yu respectfully.</p>
 <p>Fan Yu nodded. “I’ve heard from Zhou Yi that your Spiritual Detection has improved a lot. Come, let’s try it out.” A person like Fan Yu, who’d devoted his entire life to research, was always straightforward when dealing with things.</p>
 <p>“Alright.” As his pure white million year soul ring rose from his feet, Huo Yuhao’s pupils turned pale gold. An extremely minute amount of pale gold flashed through his white soul ring, but nobody managed to notice it.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao instantly released his Spiritual Detection, encapsulating everything within a fifty meter diameter.</p>
 <p>When he sensed the omni-directional three-dimensional image appear in his mind, Fan Yu nodded in satisfaction. “En, it’s actually improved by quite a bit. It’s no wonder you guys were able to become the champions of the freshmen assessment. With your Spiritual Detection, you guys would’ve definitely been able to predict all of your opponent’s movements. Eh…?”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Fan Yu suddenly realised that the image of the Spiritual Detection in his mind was changing. The originally omni-directional image had begun to shrink towards a single direction, but its range was gradually increasing. This strange feeling of having one’s senses extended was simply too magical.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi was also under the effects of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing, thus she felt it too. Her eyes immediately widened, and she cried out involuntarily, “How are you doing this?!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao saw the astonished gazes of the two teachers, but didn’t reply; when he was focusing his Spiritual Detection towards a single direction, he had to concentrate intensely.</p>
 <p>Finally, when the range of his Spiritual Detection had reached its limit, he stopped, then cancelled the activation of his soul skill.</p>
 <p>Fan Yu looked at him, a fierce gaze in his eyes. “A hundred and twenty one meters. Very good, you’ve done what I asked you to do. Yuhao, let me ask you this: Will the range of your Spiritual Detection continue to increase along with your cultivation?”</p>
 <p>After hesitating for a moment, Huo Yuhao nodded.</p>
 <p>“Good!” Fan Yu shouted loudly, jolting both Huo Yuhao and Zhou Yi.</p>
 <p>Fan Yu patted Huo Yuhao’s shoulder again. “Follow me.” With that, he turned around and walked back towards the Testing Area with large strides.</p>
 <p>“Caitou, come here.” Fan Yu waved his hand, causing He Caitou—who Huo Yuhao had previously seen—to quickly run over. The moment he saw Huo Yuhao, he immediately shouted in a surprised tone, “It’s you! Huo Yuhao, long time no see!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao smiled when he saw He Caitou’s simple face. “How are you, brother He? You look even sturdier today.”</p>
 <p>It was true; the dark-skinned He Caitou basically had the physique of an adult at this point. His muscles were rugged, while his robust body wasn’t far off from Fan Yu’s.</p>
 <p>Fan Yu continued, “Caitou, show Yuhao the power of soul masters from the Soul Tool Department. You don’t need to hold back.”</p>
 <p>“Sure!” He Caitou clearly became somewhat excited. He quickly shed his upper garments, revealing his sturdy body. After doing so, he did something that flabbergasted Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>He Caitou’s hands flew about his body as he slapped the belt on his waist unceasingly. This caused countless strange metal objects to fly out from his storage belt, which he then equipped.</p>
 <p>It took less than ten seconds for him to finish equipping himself with the strange metal objects. The current him was completely covered in pieces of black metal, however Huo Yuhao naturally had no idea what the black metal was or what it was used for.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, He Caitou’s body glowed, and his three soul rings lit up. He had two yellow and one purple soul rings—the optimum combination of soul rings. Immediately afterwards, his first soul ring lit up, causing a two or so centimeter long thick yellow object that was as long as an adult’s palm to appear in his mouth.</p>
 <p>He casually raised his left hand, and a spark appeared on the black metal covering his hand. The thick, long object in his mouth lit up, in turn causing white smoke to rise into the air.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s facial muscles twitched violently, but he forcefully stopped himself from laughing. The thing in He Caitou’s mouth was simply too similar to a freshly baked, piping hot… turd….</p>
 <p>Naturally, the object seemed to have a much harder texture….</p>
