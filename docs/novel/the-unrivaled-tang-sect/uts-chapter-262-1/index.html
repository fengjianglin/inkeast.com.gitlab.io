But what else can you do if you don’t do that? The Blazing Delicate Apricot has marked off such a tiny area, and the fight has to be carried out within this designated area. How are you going to pass this test, Huo Yuhao? Can you even pass it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er hoped Huo Yuhao would not continue risking his life for that book. However, there was a hope from deep down in her heart that he would emerge victorious in this battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao got back to his feet in the blink of an eye, as restoring soul power with a Milk Bottle didn’t require much time. He raised his left hand, and a heavy cannon appeared on his shoulder. This was the same stationary soul cannon that he had used before this, and he swiftly placed a high-power Class 5 stationary shell inside the barrel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clearly the first time that these plant-type soul beasts had seen soul tools. The Blazing Delicate Apricot didn’t know what Huo Yuhao was doing, so she continued to observe curiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pointed the cannon towards the fire lady. He lowered his voice and said, “I’m ready, senior. If I don’t leave the area you have designated, it means I haven’t lost. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot answered primly, “That’s right! Everything’s fine is you don’t step out. Come, come!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fire lady dashed forward as she spoke, lunging toward Huo Yuhao with her twin flaming knives as heat poured out from her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">BOOM!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s stationary soul cannon erupted, and a blazing red sphere of light burst out from the cannon barrel. He chose the explosive shell not because of its high temperature, but for its violent explosiveness. The Blazing Delicate Apricot was a hundred-thousand year soul beast, but its territory was only so large. The force created by a Class 5 explosive high-powered shell under normal circumstances could flatten anything within a hundred meters, while the shockwaves could reach from three hundred to five hundred meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot’s attitude changed drastically the moment that high-power shell was fired. The fire lady was thrown backwards by the explosion, and the terrifying explosive energy expanded out instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot lived up to her name as a hundred-thousand year soul beast. Ripples began to twist and contort in the air the moment she realized something was wrong, and the frightening explosive force, was refracted in all directions by the contortions in the air, and the shockwaves blasted through the sky. At the same time, the Blazing Delicate Apricot released a scarlet-red light from herself that formed a dome over her territory. This light absorbed every single ounce of the high-powered shell’s explosive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had definitely guessed how the Blazing Delicate Apricot was going to react since he dared to do this, and his aim was to buy himself enough time. The fire lady was blown away, and she needed some time to come back, while the Blazing Delicate Apricot was preoccupied with containing the shell’s explosive force. She was caught off-guard, so she couldn’t control the fire lady in time… this was his opportunity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four soul thrusters erupted behind Huo Yuhao’s back. Huo Yuhao didn’t choose to rush towards the fire lady hurtling through the air to destroy her while the Blazing Delicate Apricot was distracted, because he knew that that was an impossible endeavor. The fire lady was hurtling towards the Blazing Sunspring, and she was practically invincible and undying over there, since she was made from the Blazing Sunspring’s water in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, the four soul thrusters behind Huo Yuhao began to fire downward. A frightening force instantly propelled his body into the air, and he rocketed high up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already relied on this explosive acceleration to reach a height of fifty meters before the Blazing Delicate Apricot recovered. His flying-type soul tool expanded behind him and brought him even higher into the sky as he flew upward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How… how is that possible? He only has five soul rings… how can he know how to fly?” The Blazing Delicate Apricot was a little dazed. She was confused as to how a five-ringed human could fly through the air at such a high speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You’ve fallen behind!,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought to himself. There was no longer an aggrieved look on his face, and a self-confident smile appeared in its place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had been probing with his attacks throughout the battle before this, and it was the same even with his domain. He knew very well that it wouldn’t be easy to pass this test. He had absolute confidence to win if the battle had been a fair fight, but he was within the Blazing Delicate Apricot’s area of control, and the Blazing Sunspring also threatened him. How could he not know that he didn’t stand a single chance at all?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, he had been quietly observing this entire time, and made use of his spiritual power having just evolved into the metaphysical realm to observe... and finally, he had found a solution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot looked on as Huo Yuhao’s body flew more than a hundred meters into the air. She could control her attacks to reach that height, but this fight was supposed to be between Huo Yuhao and the fire lady. The Blazing Delicate Apricot could interfere from the side, but directly lashing out against Huo Yuhao was clearly not within the test’s rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, she could only continue watching as Huo Yuhao flew even higher into the sky. She had no idea what he wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, you’re cheating. You’ve lost – you’ve gone outside my territory!” The Blazing Delicate Apricot shouted at Huo Yuhao in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered, “No, I haven’t! How have I left your designated area? I’m flying vertically in the air, but I’m still within your territory. I haven’t stepped out of it. If I don’t fly out of this vertical area, then I haven’t lost. Am I right, senior? This test is still ongoing, you can’t lie to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao placed another Class 5 explosive shell inside his heavy cannon as he spoke, and he trained the cannon barrel downwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot immediately burst out with red light, as she was still a little fearful of that fearsome explosive force. It wasn’t much to her, and it definitely wasn’t enough to wound her, but it could destroy the land around her. Land and soil were absolutely important to plants like them, and they were also right next to the Blazing Sunspring. If the soil and ground around the Blazing Sunspring was damaged and the hot spring water flowed out, the surrounding plants would be faced with a calamitous disaster. This wasn’t something that she wanted to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pulled the trigger right at this moment. A searing red sphere erupted once more, and barreled down towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Blazing Delicate Apricot was stunned when she realized that Huo Yuhao’s wasn’t firing at her. The shell arched through the air and landed in the distance...it was going straight for the Extreme Chill Icespring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intense red light exploded once more as it came into contact with the white lake water,everything was within the precise calculations of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. Just like before, Huo Yuhao wasn’t trying to make use of the shell’s intense heat –,he wanted to use the bomb’s explosive impact and force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Extreme Chill Icespring almost instantly absorbed the explosive bomb’s heat energy. However, the terrifying explosive force and impact immediately blew a tidal wave out from the Extreme Chill Icespring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The freezing water was blown at least thirty meters into the air. Huo Yuhao had deliberately directed his shell at an angle to create this effect, and the Extreme Chill Icespring’s water bore down on the Blazing Sunspring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, Huo Yuhao was almost freefalling through the air as an orange-gold light emerged from his body. This sphere was like another cannon shell as it slammed accurately against the spring water that had been blown into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange scene occurred. The Extreme Chill Icespring’s spring water that carried intense cold was bearing down on the Blazing Sunspring, but most of the water was suddenly frozen in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took this opportunity to descend to about thirty meters above the ground. Bluish-green light erupted from his body, and a tiny figure shining with orange-gold light floated above the Extreme Chill Icespring not far from where he was, opened her little hands, and giggled in his direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A miraculous scene began to unfurl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tiny Snow Lady’s frame was growing bigger with a speed that the naked eye could see, while the airborne Extreme Chill Icespring’s water was vanishing at an alarming rate. More accurately put, the Snow Lady was absorbing the water at an alarming rate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady had released the Snow Empress’ projection when she unleashed the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice along with Huo Yuhao. However, it was different this time. The Snow Empress’ spirit seemed to be aging. She gradually became a little child, and then a teenage girl, before finally reverting to the Icesky Snow Lady’s original appearance.</span></p>

Her large dark-blue eyes were clear and deep, as if she could watch over the entire world. Long hair draped behind her back and became icy-blue in color, and her hair seemed like eternal glaciers. Intense cool immediately permeated the skies, and at this moment, the Blazing Sunpsring’s aura was completely suppressed by this frightening chill.</span></p>

He had determined his battle strategy after his meticulous observations before this. His goal was simple,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blazing Delicate Apricot and the fire lady are drawing strength from the Blazing Sunspring, and since this place is called the Icefire Yin Yang Well, there is no question that other side is an Icespring, since the Sunspring is on this side. The Sunspring weakens me, while the Icespring will greatly amplify my abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Therefore, his high-power shell was aimed that way so that he could draw upon the Icespring’s energy, and then he would use his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice again. He would give everything he had to strike down from the air and finish off the fire lady with a single strike. He had a chance to determine the outcome of this battle when the fire lady no longer had the Sunspring’s protection, and if he didn’t let the Blazing Delicate Apricot interfere.</span></p>

The Snow Lady had grown up, and she had become the actual Icesky Snow Lady. The Snow Empress’ aura was so terrifying that even Huo Yuhao felt his heart quiver in fear, the four orange-gold soul rings on his body sparkling with unprecedented intensity. Huo Yuhao felt the soul power in his body surging torrentially. At this moment, he felt as if he could actually rely on his soul power to fly!</span></p>
