To demonstrate the sincerity of the Soul Tool Department, they even brought some money over and gave some ordinary metals to be used as materials for the students to use for practical lessons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undoubtedly, Xuan Ziwen had brought about a complete overhaul of the Tang Sect’s Soul Tool Hall. Here, he was the undisputed leader!</span></p>

Last night, only the three of them had stayed in the Tang Sect to rest. While Bei Bei tried to fulfill all of Xuan Ziwen’s requests, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er had cultivated for the entire day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Brother, why did you wake us up so early?” Just as Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er finished their cultivation on a good note, Bei Bei arrived. Right now, the sky was barely bright. It was very early.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said, “It is not I who called you. Teacher Xuan wants us to go with him early, and I suspect it has something to do with the new tournament. It’s likely that we’ll represent the Tang Sect for this tournament. Let’s go and eat first. After breakfast, we’ll head back. Everyone else is waiting for us back in the inner courtyard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them had breakfast, then left the Tang Sect for Shrek Academy.</span></p>

After a while, they were back in the inner courtyard. The other four members of Shrek’s Seven Monsters were already waiting for them on the path back to Shrek Academy. After they linked up, they headed as a group toward the Sea God Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they reached the Sea God Pavilion, many people were already waiting there. They knew all of them.</span></p>

Next to them, there was a line of students. Not only were there disciples of the inner courtyard, but there were also a few from the outer courtyard. However, Huo Yuhao was familiar with all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among these students, Wang Qiu’er stood at the front. Next to Wang Qiu’er stood Dai Huabing, Ning Tian, Zhu Lu, Wu Feng, Xie Xuanyue, Cao Jinxuan, Zhou Sichen, Lan Susu, and Lan Luoluo. In total, there were ten of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among them, Wang Qiu’er, Dai Huabing, Ning Tian, Wu Feng, and Xie Xuanyue were inner courtyard disciples. The other five of them were outer courtyard disciples. Other than Zhu Lu, the other four of them were from Huo Yuhao’s class. How could they not know each other?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at them, they naturally looked back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cao Jinxuan, Zhou Sichen, Lan Susu, and Lan Luoluo looked at Huo Yuhao rather normally. However, when their gazes fell on Wang Dong’er, they couldn’t help but turn to look at Wang Qiu’er. Their gazes flitted between the two of them, and expressions of shock crossed their faces. Some of them, including Cao Jinxuan and Zhou Sichen, even looked excited. No one knew what they were thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei brought everyone before the three elders and lined everyone up smartly before bowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan nodded and said, “Good, everyone is here. Let us begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said that, his gaze fell onto Shrek’s Seven Monsters, and he said, “Yesterday, we received a formal notice from the organizing committee of the tournament that the rules of the tournament have been finalized and confirmed by all four countries on the continent. Hence, I can now tell you that the sects will take part in the new tournament. If you want to change your minds, this is your last chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei turned to look at his comrades. Everyone had a look of resolve in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei turned back and said respectfully to Elder Xuan, “Elder Xuan, Dean Yan, Dean Cai, we’ve decided that we are willing to represent the Tang Sect in this tournament.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan nodded and said, “Good. Since you’ve decided, I wish you all the best. However, I must remind you that as you are representing the Tang Sect, you won’t receive any assistance in the tournament from the Academy. Your substitutes can only be chosen from the Tang Sect. You will be completely self-reliant, and your victory, or your loss, will have nothing to do with the Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes,” the seven of them replied in unison. Naturally, they understood that Elder Xuan was not trying to absolve himself of responsibilities. Instead, he wanted to them to enter the competition properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Next, I’ll tell you about the specifics of the competition. Remember, this competition is unlike those that took place before it. As the tournament seeks to attract sects, there will be an explosive increase in the number of teams taking part. Hence, competition will be stiff. After research by the Sun Moon Empire, they decided to set the following rules...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The new tournament will be named the ‘Continental Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament’. As there are many teams taking part in it, there will be elimination rounds until only 32 teams are left. The top 32 teams will be divided into four groups. The top two teams from each group will enter the top eight. Then, the progression will be preliminary rounds, group matches and finally, the final match. All rounds will have individual elimination and group components.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In each round, every participating team can send out seven participants, and only seven. Once the name list has been confirmed, it cannot be changed. First, there’ll be individual elimination rounds. The two opposing teams will each send a competitor. Once the competitor defeats their opponent, they will continue to fight until they lose, or the participant may choose to forgo the match voluntarily. A victory will net you one point, and the winning team from the individual elimination round will be awarded 2 points. After the individual elimination round, we’ll progress to the seven-on-seven group round. The participants will still be the seven who took part in the individual elimination, with no rest in between. Even if a team has injured participants and cannot send seven members, there will be no replacements. The winning team from the group round will earn 5 points. In the preliminary rounds, the team with the higher number of points will win.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they heard the rules of the competition, Shrek’s Seven Monsters fell into deep thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan continued, “I believe that you have realized that in the new rules, what is important is individual prowess. The individual elimination round is extremely important. If you can win all the points from the individual elimination round, then you’ll win the match without having to enter the group round. Hence, the order of deployment is extremely important. So you’ll need to go back and do some research, and find what suits you best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Here, Elder Xuan turned his gaze to the side, looking at Wang Qiu’er and the rest, and said, “Standing before you are those who took part in the last Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. I can tell you that because of their exceptional performance then, they brought glory to the academy, and were bestowed the title of ‘Shrek’s Seven Monsters’. In this match, they will still participate, but not on behalf of the school. As for the ten of you, you will represent the school as either members of the main team or as substitutes. I hope you won’t let the school down and obtain good results. Shaozhe!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” answered Yan Shaozhe. He took a step forward and said, “The new team will be headed by Wang Qiu’er. The main team members include Dai Huabing, Ning Tian, Zhu Lu, Wu Feng, Xie Xuanyue, and Cao Jinxuan. The replacement team members are Zhou Sichen, Lan Susu, and Lan Luoluo. Due to the special nature of this competition, the school will not send lower-leveled participants, so as to give ourselves a fighting chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then did Huo Yuhao and the rest know that the ten of them who were called might not even have known why were they summoned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, after they heard Elder Xuan’s explanation, as well as Yan Shaozhe’s announcement, their faces all changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cao Jinxuan, Zhou Sichen, and the Lan Sisters were all excited. For them to represent Shrek Academy was an unimaginable honor! Even though it was because Shrek’s Seven Monsters could not take part, it was still an excellent opportunity that they should endeavor to seize.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the others wore uglier expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a student of the inner courtyard, Dai Huabing and Ning Tian had some news about it. From their perspective, they should naturally represent the Academy. After all, they fell within the age range and could be said to be the best among their peers.</span></p>

Ning Tian’s expression was not as bad, as she looked only slightly unnatural. Of course, this was also because of her relationship with Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er. Dai Huabing’s face, however, was as black as a pot. He was never apt at concealing his emotions, and hence, he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p>
