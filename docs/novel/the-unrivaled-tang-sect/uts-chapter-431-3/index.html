Don’t worry, we will assemble our soul engineer legion as quickly as possible. However, you’re also familiar with the Tang Sect’s circumstances. We have teacher Xuan for our mid-tier and low-tier soul tools, so our technology isn’t that much worse than the Sun Moon Empire’s. But in terms of high-level soul tools…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao tilted his head slightly and said, “I understand. Therefore, I will pay special attention to that when I go back to the frontlines. Teacher Xuan is very excited about the high altitude surveillance soul tool I passed to him yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was, teacher Xuan wasn’t just excited – his eyes had been sparkling as he exclaimed to Huo Yuhao, “The more the better!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Bei Bei continued discussing the continent’s situation and circumstances as they flew along close to the ground towards the Spirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Pagoda was still undergoing construction, but the two bottommost layers had been completed. These two levels would be renovated into the Spirit Pagoda’s headquarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao had said, the Emerald Swan was the Great Star Dou Forest’s representative, and she had stationed herself here the entire time. Huo Yuhao told her what he was doing here, and received Bi Ji’s support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was no longer just a human in Bi Ji’s eyes. Instead, he was the connecting dot that linked the humans and the world of soul beasts. Without his research, the Spirit Pagoda wouldn’t have appeared, and since he also possessed the power of destiny that he had obtained from the God Beast of Destiny, he was someone that all soul beasts would have to protect. Therefore, Bi Ji very readily agreed to help him search for suitable Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were three people in his group that needed Spirits: Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, and Jiang Nannan. Of the three of them, Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi had been at Rank 70 for quite some time, while Jiang Nannan had only broken through recently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Pagoda had been working ever since it had been established, but they kept the fusion of Spirits limited to a certain number. This was the plan that Huo Yuhao and Shrek Academy’s higher levels had put in place after some discussion back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Star Dou Forest was vast, but many soul beasts had long lives, and there were very few soul beasts who were at the end of their lives and willing to become Spirits at the same time. For now, this number was still quite large, but failure rates were bound to climb if this fusion with Spirits was allowed to spread unchecked. Another important point was that if too many soul beasts that could become Spirits were used, and if supply couldn’t meet demand, then many soul masters would probably be unable to control themselves, and would start hunting and killing soul beasts again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they could control the number of Spirits transmitted and stabilize the process at the same time, soul masters who needed soul rings would always be hopeful. Under such circumstances, they would naturally suppress the desire in their hearts to kill soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the Great Star Dou Forest represented the soul beasts, and the forest pushed out Spirit fusion to the other soul beast habitats. With the Great Star Dou Forest’s status in the world of soul beasts, there were at least a few soul beast habitats that were willing to try. The Spirit Pagoda could promote themselves at the same time, and reduce the pressure on the Great Star Dou Forest’s shoulders. This was the direction that they would develop towards in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the Spirit Pagoda could never satisfy the demand for Spirits at the rate soul masters needed soul rings as of right now. They could only reduce these killings to a small extent. For these soul beasts, however, such circumstances already a lot better than before. The truth was, soul beasts weren’t that afraid of being hunted and killed. In the end, not all soul masters could enter and leave the great forest safely, and soul beasts could hunt and kill humans at the same time. As long as there weren’t too many soul beasts that were being hunted and killed, an ecological balance could still be maintained, and there wouldn’t be much of a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bi Ji left hurriedly after studying Bei Bei and the others’ martial souls. She personally went to search for soul beasts that were suitable for Bei Bei and the others due to how important Huo Yuhao was, and Huo Yuhao and the others temporarily remained in the Spirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first batch of Spirit Masters that Huo Yuhao had personally trained came forward to greet him and talk to him when they found out that he was here. Some addressed him as “teacher”, and some addressed him as “Pagoda Master”. Huo Yuhao now had a title, and he was known as the Spirit Pagoda’s honorary Pagoda Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong had been watching coldly from one side. She didn’t talk to the others, and she put on a cold appearance from the beginning to the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao greeted and interacted with the various spirit masters, and they all began talking with Huo Yuhao about information and knowledge regarding Spirits. Ever since the Spirit Pagoda was established, these spirit masters’ statuses had been rising rapidly. The Spirit Pagoda hadn’t been promoted yet, but they already enjoyed extremely high statuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the spirit masters in the first batch came from Shrek Academy, but some came from other countries, and they were even added into their respective royal family’s Imperial Shrines. This was especially true since they began transmitting spirits, and soul masters of any rank were very respectful and reverent when they met these spirit masters. Huo Yuhao was the one who had given them this rise in status, and thus it wasn’t hard to imagine how respectful they were towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took more than two hours before he finished interacting with those spirit masters. Bi Ji hadn’t returned yet, though she had probably gone rather far into the Great Star Dou Forest to search for soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei said, “Are you tired, junior brother? The Spirit Pagoda has been developing very quickly over the past few months, and if not for the Sun Moon Empire suddenly launching an invasion, the affairs with those several branches would have been completed. Unfortunately, the Star Luo Empire and the Heavenly Soul Empire probably don’t have any mental space or time for that now. The branch at the Dou Ling Empire has been established, though, and they’re building a Spirit Pagoda of their own.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Hopefully, the Spirit Pagoda’s existence will reduce the number of soul beasts that humans kill. Because of this, we cannot let the Sun Moon Empire reach this place. Otherwise, all our past efforts and successes will be wasted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was sitting not far from Huo Yuhao, and suddenly asked him, “What exactly are Spirits?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “In simple words, Spirits are a soul beast that is willing to fuse with a soul master and retain its consciousness. These soul beasts can retain a certain part of their abilities and their reasoning. For those soul beasts who are nearing the ends of the their lives, they can thus use another method to continue living in a soul master’s body and extend their lives. Furthermore, there’s a very small chance that they can accompany the soul master and attain immortality.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong frowned and asked, “Immortality? How is that possible?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and answered, “If that soul master can break through the Ultimate Douluo’s barrier, then that is very possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong’s mouth twitched, and she said, “You’d need a Godly Seat for that. How can it be that easy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stared at her with a surprised look on his face. “You know about the Godly Seats?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong sounded a little proud as she said, “Of course I know, I…” She started her sentence, but the golden trident on her forehead that wasn’t very conspicuous flickered, and she subconsciously stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, Bi Ji walked in from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Emerald Swan was always elegant and charming whenever and wherever she was. There was a warm and faint smile on her beautiful face as she said, “Yuhao, and the rest of you, please follow me. We will go to the Spirit Transmitting Hall.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Transmitting Hall was where Spirit Masters transmitted spirits, and the magical formation that Huo Yuhao had inherited from the Calamity Necromancer Electrolux was set up there. Transmitting spirits inside the Spirit Transmitting Hall wouldn’t just conserve a Spirit Master’s soul power, it also allowed soul masters to consume less spiritual power when fusing with Spirits. The rate of success was also greatly boosted, and with Bi Ji around, who was a formidable beast king adept with healing, she could guarantee that those soul beasts that were dying would live. With these systems in place, as long as both parties were willing to complete the contract, the success rate of transmitting Spirits was almost one hundred percent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They seemed to enter a golden world when they walked into the Spirit Transmitting Hall. The Spirit Transmitting Hall was very spacious, almost five hundred square meters in surface area, and ten meters high. It took up the central area of the second level of the Spirit Pagoda’s headquarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were simple golden demonic patterns etched onto the hexagon-shaped walls. The flooring was the most dazzling part of the hall. The demonic patterns on the floor were pieced together with different metals and jewels, which all had a common characteristic: they all possessed the Element of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had inherited necromancy from Electrolux, and one couldn’t forget that the Element of light was the Calamity Necromancer’s strength. Therefore, whether it was Huo Yuhao’s necromancy or the contractual magic that was suitable for the Spirit Pagoda, it had its foundations in the Element of light.</span></p>

Bei Bei and Tang Wutong had the greatest reactions in the group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei’s body shone with gentle golden light as a subtle projection of a dragon flickered behind his back. His martial soul hadn’t completely evolved into a Radiant Holy Dragon yet, but it was now easier for him to channel his Radiant Holy Dragon’s powers. According to Bei Bei’s calculations, after obtaining a Spirit and becoming a Soul Sage, his martial soul would likely complete its final metamorphosis. Therefore, when he was choosing his Spirit, he had expressly asked Bi Ji to search for a soul beast that possessed dragon blood and the Element of light at the same time.</span></p>

A faint layer of golden light flickered subtly behind her back like golden wings. There was no question that both her and Bei Bei’s expressions were very relaxed and comfortable, and their expressions showed that they were enjoying themselves.</span></p>

It is so dense with the Element of light! If I could cultivate in such an environment, I would progress a lot faster with less effort.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong glanced at Huo Yuhao in surprise. She didn’t quite believe that Huo Yuhao was the one who had created this magical formation.</span></p>

This magical formation’s effects are impressive, but it consumes too many resources. The formation interacts with the power of the sun through these materials, and absorbs the light Element from the sunlight and stores it. This Elements of light is only used when transmitting Spirits. The Tang Sect doesn’t have such wealth right now, and this Element of light will be consumed once it is used. The formation can’t be used for cultivation, or it will be useless and meaningless for transmitting Spirits.”</span></p>

When the Tang Sect has enough wealth, we can build another one in the Tang Sect’s inner regions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They watched what was happening inside the Spirit Pagoda as they talked. There were three large soul beasts prostrate on one side not far from where they were standing. They seemed like they were also enjoying themselves as they bathed in this place filled with light energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as much as they enjoyed themselves, their aura of old age and weakness was still very evident. Their life energies were extremely weak, to the point where Bei Bei and the others hadn’t noticed their presence when they walked into the Spirit Transmitting Hall.</span></p>
