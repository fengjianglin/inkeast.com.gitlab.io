Didn’t I tell you earlier that he’s very mysterious? He can only find me, I can’t find him. He has never even let me see his true appearance. Dad, surely he’s not a bad guy, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao nodded and laughed bitterly. “Of course he’s not a bad guy. I know this person you’re talking about. From your description of him, he should be the person who’s saved me twice now. So it turns out that he’s your teacher… no wonder. Perhaps he saved me because of you. Not only is this person mysterious, but he’s also very powerful. If your teacher finds you again, you must help me express my gratitude to him. If he’s willing, I even want to thank him face-to-face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He saved your life twice?” Dai Luoli was shocked. Although he couldn’t believe that the mysterious guy his father mentioned was his own elder brother, he still believed that Huo Yuhao was capable of saving his father twice!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder brother, why do you have to be like that? Why aren’t you willing to reunite with him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">--------</span></p>

He would not do so before he believed he was strong enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time he reached Shrek City, it was already noon. Shrek City’s reconstruction was in full swing. From afar, a lot of construction work could be seen, especially the Spirit Pagoda, which was near the Great Star Dou Forest and undergoing a grand construction. Huo Yuhao didn’t even return to the Tang Sect first, but immediately went to Shrek Academy. He wanted to pass the information on to Elder Xuan for him to make a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was one of the members of the Sea God’s Pavilion, Huo Yuhao didn’t fly directly into the Academy. He stopped outside the gate before briskly walking into the Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was lesson time now, the Academy was empty. After passing the statues of the members of the first-generation Shrek’s Seven Monsters and Golden Triangle, Huo Yuhao came to the lakeside of the Sea God’s Lake. It was only then that he rose into the air before riding the waves towards the Sea God’s Island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expansion of Shrek City was a good thing for Shrek Academy. Furthermore, the relationship between Shrek and the Great Star Dou Forest was unprecedentedly harmonious because of the Spirit Pagoda, even though the beast tide had caused huge losses to both parties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been months since students from Shrek Academy had entered the forest to hunt for soul beasts. The Great Star Dou Forest was very pleased regarding this. To them, this was a demonstration of Shrek Academy’s sincerity.</span></p>

Without a doubt, they were the greatest beneficiaries of the Spirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he stepped onto Sea God’s Island, a sense of familiarity swept over Huo Yuhao. The refreshing air lessened his anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s great to be back home! It’d be nice if Dong’er were still around. If Dong’er were around, and there was no more hatred, I could just live with her on this island. Our days would be so happy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong’er…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao’s eyes widened. He couldn’t believe it as he looked forward, and his body started to shake uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This, this is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A young lady was walking towards him. Her eyes were powdery-blue, and her eyelashes were long and curly. She was very slender, and her long, powdery-blue hair flowed behind her hand. She was dressed in a white dress that accentuated her ravishing looks. She looked like a goddess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er!” Huo Yuhao exclaimed. As he was overly agitated, his voice sounded very high. In the next instant, Huo Yuhao used his Instant Teleportation and appeared in front of this young lady. He opened his arms and tightly embraced her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hadn’t expected to see Wang Dong’er again under such a circumstance and at such a time. All his worries and anxiety disappeared at this moment. All his emotions and yearning erupted. His tears flowed uncontrollably, and his vision had already turned blurry from all the tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young lady stood where she was. She seemed to have been stunned by the sudden embrace that she had received.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er, Dong’er, Dong’er…” Huo Yuhao’s tears dripped onto and slipped off her wavy, powdery-blue hair. They seemed to add a glow to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you courting death?” an embarrassed voice sounded. Immediately after this, Huo Yuhao felt as if the person he was hugging had turned into an active volcano.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She unleashed a massive force and broke free from his embrace. Following this, Huo Yuhao saw the fury in her eyes. Her thin and slender hand reached out for his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao subconsciously used his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track to avoid the terrifying force that was coming towards him. At the same time, he used his hands to block in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Vigorous soul power was unleashed.</span></p>

It was like huge waves were crashing in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he fused with Wang Qiu’er as a Sacrifice, he had inherited part of her Golden Dragon’s strength. However, he was still forced back more than ten steps, as he wasn’t prepared for Wang Dong’er’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gap opened between them, and Huo Yuhao was a little stunned. He couldn’t believe that Wang Dong’er had made a move against him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wore a fierce look on her face, and her soul rings rose from her feet. Six of them were black and one was red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had seven soul rings of unbelievable colors!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t astonished by the lights from her soul rings. He seemed intoxicated as he stared at her. He didn’t blink at all, and tears still streamed from his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young lady was also stunned when she saw the tears on his face, but as she unleashed her martial soul, a pair of huge dragon wings opened up behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The color of her dragon wings was extremely dazzling. There was a bright blue glow close to her back that extended towards the sides. As it extended, it slowly changed from blue to gold. The edges of her dragon wings were extremely weird; they were wavy like butterfly wings, and also exuded a dim golden glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a bright golden trident rune on her forehead, which started flashing. She grew slightly taller, and her dominant aura turned the space behind her into a bluish-gold ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had already lifted her right hand towards Huo Yuhao. Her face was very cold, and there was an embarrassed look in her eyes. It was evident that she was cross that Huo Yuhao had hugged her earlier. She even felt that she was being squeezed right now, which made her feel weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense bluish-gold light formed on her palm, and her second soul ring lit up. The dazzling bluish-gold lights adopted the form of a whirlpool, and a terrifying sense of suppression instantly locked onto Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao became more clear-headed when he was subjected to this heavy pressure. As he looked at the young lady’s eyes, he shuddered. “You aren’t Dong’er!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was sure that Wang Dong’er wouldn’t look at him like this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he was speaking, the young lady had already slapped her right hand towards him. A ball of blinding bluish-gold light carrying the sound of a low-pitched dragon roar surged towards his chest.</span></p>

A strong sense of restraint engulfed Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

He also lifted his right hand. His three red and four orange soul rings shone brightly. His first soul ring flashed, and his right hand was covered in diamond ice crystals. Every crystal was shining extremely brightly, helping him block the ball of bluish-gold light.</span></p>

Only a portion of them managed to take effect against him.</span></p>

We might have a misunderstanding,” Huo Yuhao hurriedly said. Whether this young lady was Dong’er or not, how would he be willing to lay his hands on her?</span></p>

However, she indeed sounded different from Wang Dong’er. She was more arrogant than Wang Dong’er, and she was also colder. However, they were equally sweet.</span></p>

I don’t believe that anyone looks like me. Ever since I came to this irksome Academy, many people have told me that I look like someone. But I’m me. The rest are fine. They only comment that I look like that person. But you’ve offended me and even hugged me! If I don’t whack you today, I won’t be appeased!”</span></p>
