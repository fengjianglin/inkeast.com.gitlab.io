 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For example, there are many among the Heavenly Soul Empire who were from Shrek Academy that have already submitted to the Sun Moon Empire. They can submit after the Heavenly Soul Empire perished. However, do you believe that they’ll immediately revolt if Shrek Academy is destroyed? Both of you have been to Shrek Academy before. Tell me, how does it feel over there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen gritted his teeth and didn’t say anything. Meng Hongchen said, “It’s really a learning institution that every soul master wants to go to. Even though we were ostracized by the students there, the teachers didn’t do the same. As long as we asked, we got the correct answers. Over there, they have the best learning and cultivation atmosphere. Any student that hails from Shrek Academy is outstanding. Furthermore, everyone has a deep love for the academy. If possible, I would really love to go back there to learn. That’s why I can understand why many of their inner courtyard students choose to remain with the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nonsense!” Xiao Hongchen roared furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen shook his head and said, “Kid, you’re too stubborn. Did you know? I’ve been to Shrek Academy before, and really wanted to learn there once. That’s also the reason why both of you were able to go there in the exchange. It’s because I was relying on you to fulfil my dream! I know how outstanding their students are. Those who come to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy will be accomplished too, but I still couldn’t help but send both of you there. It’s not just me. Every soul master wants to go there. Everyone wants to go there, even His Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His Majesty?” Meng Hongchen exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen nodded and answered, “Believe it or not. If His Majesty rules the continent in the future, the Crown Prince will learn in Shrek Academy, as long as his safety can be guaranteed. This is the charm of Shrek Academy! That’s why Shrek will be fine. Everything that Xiao mentioned earlier is just ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for why I told Huo Yuhao everything earlier, the reason is actually very simple. It’s because I hope that he’ll know, or rather, I don’t wish to see the empire dominate the continent so quickly. If the empire successfully rules the continent, soul engineers like us will lose our footing. As long as the war continues, both of you have the opportunity to shine in the Worship Hall in the future. This is why I did that. That’s right, I betrayed my empire. However, I had to do it for my family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen shut his eyes in pain. “Both of you must remember that you should never treat Huo Yuhao as your target anymore. Neither of you stand a chance. I’ve never even heard of such an extraordinary genius emerging from Shrek Academy before. He’s already fully developed. Even the two Ultimate Douluo in the Holy Ghost Church might not even be able to kill him. Once they die, the continent will belong to Huo Yuhao. If there’s anyone in the history of the Douluo Continent who can compare to him, it has to be the founder of the Tang Sect, Tang San. Back then, Tang San led Shrek’s Seven Monsters as they established the Tang Sect. They dominated the entire continent, and he finally became a god. He defeated the Hallmaster of the Martial Soul Hall, who had already become a god. From there, he tore the Martial Soul Hall apart and helped his empire truly control the continent. After that, he rose into the godly realm and vanished. Although this is a legend, I believe that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong both possess the potential to become gods if such a realm exists. They are opponents that neither of you can challenge at all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gods?” When he heard this word, even Xiao Hongchen was stunned. He had never thought of it before. What did it mean to be a god? Were there really gods in this world? No one knew. However, this legend existed in Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even until now, the statues of the first generation of Shrek’s Seven Monsters who became gods were still outside the gates of Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen nodded seriously. “It’s really possible. Time will prove everything. Perhaps we can really see the appearance of gods in our lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng Hongchen was completely confused by now, whereas Xiao Hongchen was in a daze. He didn’t expect that the person he had always regarded as his greatest foe had the potential to become a god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t stay any longer after they left the palace. They flew into the sky. All the surveillance soul tools were just a joke to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, do you believe Jing Hongchen?” Tang Wutong asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Highly credible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Tang Wutong couldn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “He’s past his prime! Can’t you tell? Jing Hongchen is already very displeased with the Sun Moon Empire. He was once the head of the Illustrious Virtue Hall and one of the best Class 9 soul engineers. What about now? Although he’s the mayor of the Heaven Dou City and appears to be very glorified, he has actually already been excluded from the core of power in the Sun Moon Empire, by the work of Xu Tianran. How can he not hate him? From the words of his two grandchildren earlier, it does seem that he’s indignant. Since that’s the case, he needs his grandchildren to rise to the occasion. Peace is never what powerful individuals need. They only stand a chance if this war continues. Jing Hongchen is just afraid that there will no longer be any chaos. Of course, he doesn’t want us to really harm the Sun Moon Empire, but he doesn’t want the Sun Moon Empire to rule the entire continent so quickly. It won’t be beneficial for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s actually so selfish?” Tang Wutong was a little scornful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt a little heavy and said, “That’s not really it. With his family around, he can’t just think about himself!” He thought of the White Tiger Duke.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Did he ignore mom and me because…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Am I really searching for excuses on his behalf?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was shocked, but he found it amusing too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could still deeply remember that he had secretly sworn to avenge his mother when he became the strongest person in the Douluo Continent when he left the Duke’s Mansion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was already close to his goal of becoming the strongest person on the continent. If he could become an Ultimate Douluo in the future, he could become the strongest person in this world. However, he was no longer as vengeful as he used to be. As he became stronger, a lot of his hate slowly dissipated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very grateful to the academy and the Tang Sect. Without the guidance of the academy, he might have actually gone down the wrong path. Perhaps he might have become an evil soul master. It was precisely because the academy kept on changing his perspective and was concerned about his growth. The academy nurtured him to where he was today. It was also because of the encouragement he got from his teammates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a grateful person. He had always been like this. He would use his whole life to repay this debt of gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dim starlight flashed in the sky. The stars were extremely bright tonight. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong concealed themselves in the night sky using Huo Yuhao’s Imitation, and flew towards the south.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What should we do next? Kill those soul engineers? It’s a good opportunity before they rendezvous with the army.” Tang Wutong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “It’s indeed a good opportunity. Ju Zi once proposed this idea to me – if I can kill Xu Tianran, she won’t wage war for the next ten years. The Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires would be given the chance to get stronger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? She wants to kill her husband?” Tang Wutong was astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a bitter smile on Huo Yuhao’s face. “It seems so. I don’t know what she’s thinking either. However, I’ve got to admit that her proposition is tempting. That’s why my next target is possibly Xu Tianran. Xu Tianran is an anti-hero. The Sun Moon Empire is really able to dominate the entire continent under his control. However, there’ll certainly be chaos within the Sun Moon Empire if he dies. Ju Zi will need some time to stabilize her son’s position in the empire. That’s why the Sun Moon Empire would be unable to wage any war in the short-term, even if she goes back on her word. That’s why killing Xu Tianran is my goal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “So you’re going to the Sun Moon Empire to discuss this matter with Ju Zi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head. “That’s not the only reason. A lion will only negotiate with a tiger. If we don’t demonstrate our strength, how can I possibly force her to keep her promise? That’s why we must still act and weaken her forces. After that, we’ll negotiate with her. In this way, she’ll be more pressed. This is something we can’t avoid. If possible, I don’t wish to become enemies with her. Ju Zi is too clever, especially on the battlefield. Even I can’t outwit her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded and said, “The only flaw with Ju Zi is her individual ability. If she were stronger, she’d really be too dangerous. Yuhao, will you kill her if she threatens the academy one day?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she asked this, Tang Wutong looked very serious. When Huo Yuhao looked into her eyes, Tang Wutong revealed a guilty expression. She lowered her head and said, “I’m sorry, Yuhao. I still feel a little uncomfortable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pulled her into his embrace and controlled their flying speed just like this.</span></p>
