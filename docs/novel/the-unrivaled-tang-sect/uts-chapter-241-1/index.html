 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er also sensed his thoughts and glanced at him, seemingly asking him if he’d really expose their martial soul fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t decide. Even though Wang Dong’er was extremely magnanimous, he also understood her very well. Although she’d been convinced, was she really not bothered? As a normal girl, how could she not be? She simply didn’t want to put him in a bad position, thus she acted like she wasn’t. This was heart wrenching for her! Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t want anything else to affect his relationship with Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The noises of battle became louder and louder. Fortunately, the echoes that they heard relayed that the two unknown soul beasts weren’t moving around much as they fought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er shut her eyes and listened quietly. After a brief moment, she said, “They have roughly between thirty thousand and thirty-five thousand years of cultivation; they’re at least second-grade soul beasts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul beasts weren’t distinctly separated into grades. It was more-so just an appraisal of their innate abilities. Simply put, Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears were a clear example of first-grade soul beasts, whereas second-grade soul beasts were still pretty outstanding despite not being the strongest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wolf-apes that Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er had met earlier had possessed great fighting strength. However, they were only truly strong because of their three-way martial soul fusion skill. Solely based on their individual abilities, they were only barely second-grade, even with their Instant Teleportation factored in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Cai Mei’er had claimed that these two soul beasts were second-grade, and that they also possessed thirty to thirty-five thousand year cultivations, it meant that their cultivations were equivalent to experienced Soul Sages from the inner courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though soul beasts with cultivations from ten thousand to ninety thousand years were collectively categorized as ten thousand year soul beasts, there was still a huge gap in their cultivations. The ten thousandth, thirty thousandth, fifty thousandth, and seventy thousandth year all represented barriers that soul beasts had to cross. Their abilities also improved significantly when they did so. If these two soul beasts managed to reach fifty thousand years of cultivation, they’d be equivalent in strength to Soul Douluos. Furthermore, soul beasts were physically stronger than humans. As such, even a Soul Douluo would find it difficult to challenge them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er said, “Let’s not rush. If I’m not wrong, this is probably a fight for territory. Such a fight will usually last for quite some time. However, it’s not a life-and-death battle; they’ll probably hold back. We’ll head over when they’ve depleted more of their strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could handle the two soul beasts, but this was still the Core Region of the Great Star Dou Forest. Who knew if a hundred thousand year soul beast would suddenly fall from the sky? If something like that happened, they might all die! That was why it was imperative that they ensure everyone was in top condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since they were waiting, everyone quickly adjusted their condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er walked up to Wang Qiu’er and smiled at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er thought to herself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why’re you smiling at me?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She said coldly, “Is something the matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er shook her head and replied, “No, I just wanted to thank you for helping Yuhao find a suitable soul ring. I would also like to apologize for being rude towards you in the past.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er snorted and said, “Can’t he thank me himself? Are you saying that he needs you to thank me instead?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er wasn’t bothered by her words. She simply chortled and didn’t say anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er naturally stopped talking to her as well. She glanced at Huo Yuhao again, who was standing a short distance away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Huo Yuhao didn’t have the time to thank her. He’d unleashed his Spiritual Detection and was trying to detect any movement around him. As the team’s main control-type soul master, he’d been the busiest person since entering the Core Region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear cubs were a little clingy. Although Huo Yuhao had put them down, they were now sleeping very comfortably while hugging his thighs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was helpless to do anything about it. When he fought later on, he’d have no choice but to treat them as burdens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for a moment, Huo Yuhao said to Cai Mei’er, “Dean Cai, it shouldn’t be a problem if I take out a slightly larger soul tool here, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er was stunned for a moment. Even though she was the dean of the Martial Soul Department, she didn’t know much about soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you want to take out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao glanced down and said, “These two fellows are too clingy; it won’t be convenient if I bring both of them along for the fight later on. We can’t freeze them again either. Even if they can recover from it, it’ll still be harmful to them. I’d like to put them inside a soul tool and prevent them from running about when they wake up. At the same time, the soul tool will also protect them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er said, “It shouldn’t be a problem as long as you’re sure that the soul tool is safe enough. It’s also very dangerous for them to be here. Any soul beast that sees them will definitely attack and eat them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Don’t worry, I won’t let them get too far away from me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he’d finished speaking, he took a few steps to the side and lifted his left hand towards a slightly spacious area. His Starlight Sapphire ring shone brightly, and a dim blue light spread through the air. Following this, something huge appeared in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a huge ball-shaped entity with eight long legs. The ball-shaped entity was two meters in diameter, and had a very strange metallic luster on its golden body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present was stunned by its appearance; they’d never seen a soul tool of this scale before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled slightly and said, “This is called an all-terrain exploration soul tool. I learned how to use it in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. Our academy has the blueprint for it too. However, I also made one for myself, and added some stuff that I’ve personally researched to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He grabbed the two cubs and walked towards the all-terrain exploration soul tool after he’d finished explaining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he looked at it, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but think of Ju Zi and Ke Ke. All three of them had sat in a similar soul tool to explore the Jing Yang Mountain Range before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This all-terrain exploration soul tool had been completed by Huo Yuhao and included some of the elements of the Tang Sect’s hidden weapons. Not only did that mean it less formation arrays were required, but it also meant that it was more flexible when controlled. Huo Yuhao had also used the best materials he had to create it. It was now at the standard of a Class 6 soul tool, with its defense close to that of a Class 7 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao leapt into the soul tool and the opening closed behind him. When he poured his soul power into it, the soul tool stood up, its legs extending and retracting a few times. A barrier then shone around it as he continued to pour his soul power into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present was curious when they saw this interesting soul tool. They’d seen soul tools used to carry people before, but this was the first time they’d seen a soul tool that both completely covered a soul master and appeared mobile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s voice resonated from the soul tool, “When this fight is over, whoever’s interested in the all-terrain exploration soul tool can come try it out. It can hold three people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was evidently not suitable for them to try it out right now. After all, they were soul masters. It would be easier for them to show off their abilities outside of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soul tool’s legs started to move under Huo Yuhao’s control. It only took a few steps for it to reach the spot where Huo Yuhao had been initially. Meanwhile, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection hadn’t been affected at all; he was still using it from inside.</span></p>

However, that didn’t mean they were willing to be replaced by soul tools. This was also what many soul masters thought. Soul engineers were simply going to become more and more powerful as soul tools evolved. In the near future, the world might belong to soul engineers. As for pure soul masters like them? They were likely to be eliminated.</span></p>

Long-range soul tools were particularly problematic for soul masters. No matter how strong a soul master was, he couldn’t deal with long-range attacks if they were too overwhelming. This was the key difference between cold weapons and firearms.</span></p>

Yet, why had their progress in developing soul tools been so slow over the last few thousand years? Was it because their resources weren’t as vast as the Sun Moon Empire’s? The Sun Moon Empire was around the same size as the Star Luo Empire. Furthermore, resources could be bought even if they couldn’t be snatched!</span></p>

It was like a small empire that held an enormously respectable position on the continent. If Elder Mu hadn’t decided that Shrek Academy should start putting more focus on its Soul Tool Department before he passed away, the development of soul tools in the academy was likely to have stalled even longer.</span></p>
