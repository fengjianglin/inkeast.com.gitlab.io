This awakening is extremely important to you. Once it’s completed, your martial soul might completely evolve. If it evolves to the Xuanwu Shield, you’ll become the heir to the sect leader.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The martial soul that was passed down in the Mysterious Underworld Sect was the Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle. There was a secret that only those within the Sect knew: the evolution of the Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They only developed this ritual after many attempts by the ancestors of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Wen knew this secret not only because he was Xu Sanshi’s personal servant, but also because five generations of his family had served under the Mysterious Underworld Sect. They were true, core disciples. Even though they couldn’t undergo the awakening of their martial souls, they still held a very high status in the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ritual was very crucial in evolving the Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle to the Xuanwu Shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ritual was carried out when he was fifteen, and still a virgin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regarding this, the Mysterious Underworld Sect had always kept it a secret. After all, it wasn’t a very glorious thing. The Mysterious Underworld Sect was reclusive. To carry on the survival of the sect, they had no choice but to do this. When this time came, they would always choose a girl from a good family and offer her a huge sum of money if she was willing to have sexual intercourse with the chosen male disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the girl was willing to join the Mysterious Underworld Sect, she could at least become his concubine, and possibly his wife if their relationship developed well. If she wasn’t willing, she could leave with that sum of money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This had long become a rule of the Mysterious Underworld Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the most likely candidate to experience an awakening of his martial soul, Xu Sanshi was selected. A virgin was also picked out for him after a strict selection process by the Mysterious Underworld Sect. Not only did the girl have to be a virgin, but she had to be a soul master that wasn’t older than Xu Sanshi, too! In addition, she had to be intelligent, and beautiful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, everything had been prepared. The only thing left was for Xu Sanshi to enter the room and start the ritual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi’s gaze was a little lost. Of course he recalled that night, or rather, this night. He was only fifteen years old then, but he was already very curious about the opposite gender, due to how his family attached such importance to this ritual and his natural development. He was very excited as he entered the room, but it had turned into a huge mistake…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, he couldn’t remain calm as everything played out again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, young master, you can enter now. Do your best.” Chen Wen’s serious expression turned playful again. There was even a look of envy and perversion on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young master, I’ve taken a look for you. This lady is extremely beautiful. Master even mentioned that you can wed her if you like.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi took in a deep breath. As he looked at the door, he started to have mixed feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nannan, I’m coming,” he silently said to himself before walking over with big steps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley letting me try again because it wants to reawaken my martial soul again? No, it’s testing my sincerity. It’s testing what’s really important in my heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What had happened then kept on playing in Xu Sanshi’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he had walked into the room, he had been eager to head to the bed. All he saw was a ravishing young lady who had shut her eyes under the dim lights. It was his first time seeing her. However, he didn’t know that she was also…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to several reasons, he had had no choice but to do this. He pressed down on Jiang Nannan, but her rigid body was trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi tried a few times, but he didn’t succeed. Finally, he decided to try the position that his uncles once joked about. He flipped her over and pressed down from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he went into the wrong hole… only to find that he was unable to stop, as the evolution process had begun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was extremely gifted. The Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle eventually still evolved, but the evolution wasn’t complete. It was only a half-completed Xuanwu Shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This incident was the reason why Jiang Nannan ostracized him so much. Xu Sanshi also realized that he had made a big mistake, but he couldn’t help what had already happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She left after the incident. When Xu Sanshi saw her again, she was already in Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Xu Sanshi had mixed feelings as this scene replayed itself in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he saw Jiang Nannan, he only had a burning passion towards her. However, Jiang Nannan treated him as if he were a brutal beast. Since then, he had gone through a lot before he finally got together with Jiang Nannan. With the help of the Sea God’s Fated Blind Date, he managed to get Jiang Nannan to accept him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he knew that she still hadn’t forgotten what had happened, even though she accepted him now. It had also been affecting their relationship. It was only recently that she was willing to hold his hand, hug him, and kiss him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan had once told Xu Sanshi that she was still emotionally hurt from that incident, and needed more time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Xu Sanshi had to face this girl whose eyes were shut, and who was waiting for him quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi pursed his lips tightly and looked into the sky. Right now, his emotions were surging, and were about to flow out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Love Querying Valley. You let me live this out once again. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I’m willing to start afresh from here. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he bowed to the bright moon in the sky. After that, he pushed the door open and walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Wen was a little confused at how Xu Sanshi was acting, but still continued to guard the door for him. He stood outside the door and guarded the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he entered the room, the lights were as dim as before. Xu Sanshi could still clearly recall that he was excited and nervous when he rushed to the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he was taking slow steps. His body was even trembling. As he was agitated, he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He finally walked in front of the bed. He saw Jiang Nannan waiting silently for destiny, or rather misfortune, to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lifted his head and forcefully held back his tears. He gently unveiled her and sat beside her on the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan shuddered when she felt someone coming, and she became very tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes! She was still very young then, around fourteen years old. I’m really a beast.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi lifted his hand and slapped himself on the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pak!”</span></p>

She was very nervous, and looked at Xu Sanshi with a frightened look on her face.</span></p>

After that, he stood up from the bed and tried to comfort her.</span></p>

Believe me, I won’t let you come to harm. Not now. Not in the future.”</span></p>

She didn’t know what to say as she looked at him.</span></p>

He gently said, “My name is Xu Sanshi. I know that they gave you money to consummate this ritual with me, but I won’t do it. I don’t want to hurt you.”</span></p>

However, her fear and anxiety suddenly disappeared. It was just that Xu Sanshi was still overwhelmed with emotions right now, and didn’t discover it.</span></p>

You can put your clothes back on. I think you’ll feel safer that way. We can chat afterwards. To put them at ease, I can’t leave this room tonight.”</span></p>

I told you that I won’t hurt you. Not now. Not in the future. How can the awakening of my martial soul compare to you? So what if it’s the Xuanwu Shield? So what if I become the sect master? They are nothing compared to you. I’m willing to give up everything for you. Even if I can’t enter the inner courtyard of Shrek Academy in the future and become a member of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, I’m still willing.”</span></p>

He walked into a corner and faced the wall. He smiled. The trauma in his heart had finally been removed. After so many years, the trauma, pain and guilt in his heart had finally vanished.</span></p>

I can give up everything for you, Nannan. I love you. If we can start afresh, I’m willing to use everything I’ve got to make this right. I’ll love you with all my heart so that you’ll no longer be traumatized.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tears started to stream down his face as he smiled.</span></p>
