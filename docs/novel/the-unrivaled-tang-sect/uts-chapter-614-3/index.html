 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal, I’d urge you to think twice before doing that.” Elder Kong whispered to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi gazed into the distance in the direction of Star Luo City. If there were no one from Shrek Academy or the Tang Sect in Star Luo City, she might really have gone on to slaughter everyone in there. However, that was not the case. She could only try and scare the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi unsheathed the long sword by her side as she pointed it at the White Tiger Duke. “Dai Hao, I shall dig our your heart and bless my parents with your blood today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bring it on!” Dai Hao exclaimed angrily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi glared coldly at Dai Hao. Even though she did not dare to kill everyone within the city, she must exact her revenge on Dai Hao. This was the bare minimum she had to do to avenge her parents. She had decided to disappoint Huo Yuhao by breaking the promise they had made, and was willing to accept the consequences for that.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She pointed her sword at the White Tiger Duke’s chest. She started to move the tip of the sword closer to his chest as the blade of the sword released a powerful sword light. She wanted to see the White Tiger Duke crumble under the pressure of impending death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was destined to be disappointed. The White Tiger Duke’s eyes were full of arrogance and determination. There was not a single bit or cowardice or fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Screw it! I should just kill him and end this once and for all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, an intense murderous intent formed in Ju Zi’s eyes as she retracted her sword and prepared herself to make the final stab to end this hatred in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a deafening roar echoed across the sky. It was as loud as the thunder one would hear in an incredibly large thunderstorm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I dare you to do that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those simple six words were enough to cause the entire area to tremble. The powerful sound wave was infused with an overwhelming amount of spiritual power as it echoed across a fifty-kilometer radius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normal soldiers would only hear an unbelievably loud voice. However, soul masters and soul engineers felt the impact of the voice. It was almost as though their heads had been hit by a hammer. The more powerful their cultivation was, the greater the impact on them. Ju Zi felt dizzy after hearing the voice, and was unable to stab the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dark and gloomy sky suddenly lit up as a radiant golden sun started to illuminate the land beneath it. Its intense glow was cast across the entire sky as it caused ripples in the air whenever it flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Elder Kong was startled by the overwhelming spiritual suppression released by the sun. He gasped, “An Ultimate Douluo? Who is this powerful Ultimate Douluo?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time he had seen someone use their voice to spiritually suppress everyone within a fifty-kilometer radius. In fact, this was unprecedented in the history of soul masters. But now, it was happening right before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Elder Kong could hear the rage in the person’s voice, it was a bright voice. It was definitely not Elder Xuan’s voice.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan is not the only Ultimate Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that Kong Deming was only able to fend off Elder Xuan’s attacks with his Class 10 soul engineer powers. It was almost impossible for them to conclude who was more powerful. The Sun Moon Empire had only gained the upper hand because of their soul tools. Because of them, their individual fighting power was enhanced, while their enemies’ combat ability was reduced. If Star Luo City was to gain the help of another Ultimate Douluo, it would be a very difficult victory for the Sun Moon Empire. They would have to sustain a heavy cost to take down Star Luo City! How could Elder Kong not be worried about the appearance of this mysterious Ultimate Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, as a Class 10 soul engineer, he was able to tell that this newcomer was probably more powerful than Elder Xuan. He or she was not just an ordinary Ultimate Douluo. Even Elder Kong was not confident of defeating this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was one person who was even more shocked than Elder Kong. The person was none other than the War God Empress who was standing behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the loud exclamation from the sky, Ju Zi might have been momentarily overwhelmed by a dizzying sensation. However, after she composed herself, her body started to tremble uncontrollably. She was not trembling in excitement this time around. On the contrary, she was trembling with fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was right! She was trembling with fear! The reason was that she knew whose voice that was. That was precisely why she was so scared of his sudden appearance. He was the person whom she really did not want to see at this very instant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the golden sun was irradiating the land with its brilliant, intense glow, the air started to become incredibly cold. Snowflakes started to fall from the sky as they enveloped the entire battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that it was only the start of autumn at Star Luo City. However, the ambient temperature was plunging at an insane speed. In fact, it was so cold that the snowflakes were just drifting about in the sky. For some strange reason, they could not land on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A silver light flickered from the distant sky. During its first flicker, it appeared to be at the furthest end of the sky. However, when it flickered again, it was already right before Ju Zi and Kong Deming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two figures appeared in the air right before the Sun Moon Empire’s army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is that him? Is it really him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi almost stumbled as her mind turned completely blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming immediately raised his hand and dragged the White Tiger Duke towards him. He used his soul tool to control and suppress him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, it was apparent that the people who had exclaimed earlier were a man and a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man was wearing a long pale blue robe. His long hair was swaying in the wind behind his back. While he was undeniably handsome, he had an aura which seemed to give off the impression that he was no longer affected by worldly concerns. Snowflakes spiraled around his body in a continuous fashion. Whenever the snowflakes were about to disappear, they would give off a faint silver glow which was almost indiscernible to the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The female who was standing by his side was even more radiant. Her long violet hair draped from her head to her toes. Her breathtaking looks were definitely more than enough to bring shame to the moon. Her violet eyes were absolutely mesmerizing. A gentle and warm golden glow flickered around her body, and there was a faint dragon roar every time the golden light flickered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Audible gasps could already be heard around Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that Huo Yuhao? The Spirit Ice Douluo who challenged ten of our people. The person who is standing beside him must be the Dragon Butterfly Douluo, Tang Wutong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, the pair who had suddenly appeared on the battlefield was Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After cultivating for three long years, they had finally completed their closed-door cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those three years went by very quickly for them because both of them were in a deep meditative state. Huo Yuhao had finally completed his absorption of the Evileye Tyrant’s spiritual power. He was able to use his powerful spiritual power—which was already beyond that of an Ultimate Douluo, and at borderline demi-god level—to complete his third soul core and fuse all of the soul power in his body. At the same time, he was finally able to master his control of spatial power. His third soul core was a spatial soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was already done with his cultivation about half a year ago. However, Tang Wutong had needed some help because she did not possess an equally powerful spiritual power. She was stuck at a bottleneck, and needed Huo Yuhao to use his soul power and spiritual power to guard her. She was only able to make her breakthrough and complete her third soul core a day ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, they were able to build on their achievements as the first people to possess Yin Yang Complement soul cores and form their third soul core. They had created another miracle in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they were ultimately still Ultimate Douluo, they were definitely the most powerful Ultimate Douluo in the history of the Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After completing their closed-door cultivation, Huo Yuhao had a deeper appreciation and sensitivity towards destiny. He immediately sensed that something was amiss. Hence, they flew to a neighboring city to understand what had happened while they were away. They were utterly shocked by what they had heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They learned that Ju Zi did not keep the promise they had made previously, but had gone on to start another war, and had already destroyed the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this news, Huo Yuhao could not help but fly into a rage. At this instant, he could sense his heart contracting as he felt an inexplicable sense of fear. Led by his sense of destiny, he ripped apart the space before him and tried to rush to Star Luo City with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant when Ju Zi was about to stab the White Tiger Duke, Huo Yuhao was actually about two hundred and fifty kilometers away. However, he could sense the fear in his heart reaching an unprecedented peak. Hence, he used his voice to rip apart space to stop her. Following which, within the blink of an eye, he was able to use his mastery of spatial power to transport himself and Tang Wutong to where Ju Zi and Kong Deming were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was instantly overwhelmed by several emotions after seeing her and the White Tiger Duke, who was no longer wearing any armor or a shirt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Similarly, Ju Zi was also overwhelmed by a multitude of emotions. As they stared at one another, her eyes reddened.</span></p>
