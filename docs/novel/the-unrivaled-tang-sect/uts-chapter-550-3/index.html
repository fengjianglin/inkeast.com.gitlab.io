 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though they didn’t know how their commander detonated the aerial surveillance soul tools above Radiant City, they understood that they would forever remember today’s battle. They didn’t know if such a scene would happen again in the future, but they were brimming with belligerence and the will to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao suddenly opened his eyes, and everyone could see two beams of golden light that were each about a meter wide and almost material blast out from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying spiritual undulations burst forward unforgivingly, and the same voice appeared in every single soul engineer’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stationary soul cannon shells, prepare to fire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannon could hold forty-eight shells. They would only use Milk Bottles and the soul masters’ soul power under normal circumstances to compress and amplify before firing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But today was different. They had received an order before they moved out, that those forty-eight shells would be changed for stationary soul cannon shells. This meant that every Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannon now contained forty-eight stationary soul cannon shells. The shells that the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion were loading were almost half of the Tang Sect’s annual production.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Detection allowed the dark sky in those soul engineers’ eyes to become three-dimensional images, and every single person had a different target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fire!” Huo Yuhao shouted as the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion’s three hundred Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons fired at the same time, for the first time in history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…” Howling sounds appeared one after another. The rhythm was rich, like a grand and magnificent symphony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pillars of fire and light flashed from behind the Tang Sect’s members as they left brilliant trails behind them as they flew towards Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three hundred Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons fired at the same time, and every blast fired sixteen stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou’s facial muscles twitched continuously as he looked on. That was all precious money!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four thousand eight hundred stationary soul cannon shells were all fired at once. Even the Sun Moon Empire, who had mastered the most powerful soul tool technology, wouldn’t do something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao did that. He wasn’t stingy at all as he blasted away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four thousand eight hundred stationary soul cannon shells rose into the air, and in that moment, those bright and brilliant flashes dispersed and flew in all directions. They were like flowers thrown into the air, and that feeling was filled with wonder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei muttered under his breath, “Did little junior brother integrate the Tang Sect’s hidden weapon techniques into artillery fire?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons were being developed continuously. Every two cannon barrels could aim at one target. Under normal circumstances, it was almost impossible for the aimers to hit eight different targets with sixteen barrels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao didn’t have this problem. Huo Yuhao could divide his mind with his frightening spiritual power, and it was he who gave those cannon crews all two hundred and forty precise targets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those cannons were fired in order and not at the same time, and that was the reason why everything came together like a symphony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those explosions naturally occurred one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aerial surveillance soul tools had been almost entirely annihilated, but the low-altitude soul tools at five hundred meters were still around. Even though most of them just swept across the ground for surveillance, they gave immediate feedback when so many soul cannon shells appeared at the same time in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four soul tool fronts around Radiant City activated their linked defenses almost as soon as was possible. They didn’t know what their enemies were attacking, so that was undoubtedly the best response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Intense explosions first came from these four corners!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Radiant City’s soul tool fronts no longer had their aerial surveillance tools, so they were in a disadvantaged position. They could only use their internal ground-based aerial surveillance soul tools to lock onto those stationary soul cannon shells that were flying over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But everything happened too suddenly and too quickly, and they couldn’t possibly intercept every single shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Explosions rang out from Radiant City’s four corners. Some shells exploded in the sky, and some exploded on a soul tool front’s defensive barrier. Firecrackers seemed to fall towards the ground as they sparked in every corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as these explosions continued at the city’s four corners, sparks and flashes appeared once more in the sky. But these explosions were a lot closer to the ground, because the low-altitude surveillance soul tools were the ones that were being blown up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost half of the more than two hundred low-altitude surveillance soul tools were eradicated in the blink of an eye. The four soul tool fronts could barely struggle to defend themselves, not to mention the fact that they didn’t have the time to cooperate with their low-altitude surveillance soul tools so that their soul tool fronts could intercept those attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Second round, fire!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already given his second order to fire when the fireworks cracked open at the city’s four corners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…” A second symphony could be heard as another four thousand eight hundred stationary soul cannon shells were fired, and rocketed toward Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou closed his eyes painfully, but the Tang Sect’s soul engineers were more overcome with shock and passion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a modern battle! They were launching long-range attacks against their enemies by relying on firepower. Every one of them was confident because their enemies were far away, and there were eighteen spectral gates behind them that they could retreat through. It wasn’t hard to imagine how high their morale was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The explosions were almost seamlessly connected. This time, more shells were aimed into the air besides suppressing those four soul tool fronts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were almost no more low-altitude surveillance soul tools after that round, and some of Radiant City’s backup aerial surveillance soul tools hadn’t even reached their optimal locations before they were blasted back to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Prepare for the third round. Second senior brother! Give it to me.” Huo Yuhao reached out with his right hand to He Caitou, who had appeared next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou’s eyes were full of longing, and he couldn’t bear to comply, but he didn’t dare to hesitate for even a second at a time like this. Light flashed as an enormous cannon with a silver barrel appeared in his hands, and he passed it to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao reached out and grabbed this heavy cannon, which was two meters long and had a barrel opening with a diameter of two hundred and fifty millimeters, and placed it on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao went down on one knee and peered through the scope. His left hand held the cannon barrel, and he trained it in front of him while he wrapped his right hand around the central part of the barrel’s thickest part. He was like a statue, and he didn’t move at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xu Tianran, take a hit from my Tai Ah!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third wave, fire!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every stationary soul cannon shell stored in the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons was finally fired in the last wave, down to the very last one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Forty thousand eight hundred Class 4 stationary soul cannon shells surged into the air. This time, they didn’t disperse, as they only had one target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four soul tool fronts defending Radiant City at its four corners had all been bombarded by hundreds of stationary soul cannon shells. Even though they were only Class 4 shells, they were still stationary soul cannon shells!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They couldn’t use their high-powered compression array soul tools, and their linked defenses were falling apart under such circumstances. The soul engineers and soul masters within those soul tool fronts had consumed too much of their soul power, and two-thirds of their backup Milk Bottles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nine thousand six hundred stationary soul cannon shells had been fired in the previous two rounds! An attack of this scale was unprecedented for Radiant City’s soul tool fronts ever since their establishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how could they have the capacity to resist the third wave?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All four thousand eight hundred stationary soul cannon shells in the third wave were aimed at the royal palace. The shells zipped across the sky and appeared above the royal palace in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right at this moment, the royal palace’s outermost walls suddenly lit up as sixteen golden pillars surged into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These sixteen pillars of light burst straight up to more than five hundred meters in the sky. They swept across the heavens as they cooperated with each other excellently.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Explosions crackled continuously across the sky. The stationary soul cannon shells didn’t fall, and most of them were detonated in the sky as those sixteen pillars swept over them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These pillars’ trajectories were evidently premeditated, as they swept across the areas that had the densest concentration of stationary soul cannon shells.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The remaining Class 4 stationary soul cannon shells fell inside the royal palace, but most of them couldn’t do anything at all as they clashed against the palace’s formidable defensive barrier. They created pretty ripples one after another before they were destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sixteen golden pillars were like sixteen divine pillars that protected the royal palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just as they were sweeping across the sky, another beam of white light hovered five thousand meters in the sky above the royal palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a beam of white light that resembled a white spear, with its tip pointed downward. Its entire body radiated bright white colors, and as those sixteen golden pillars moved, it also moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It disappeared in a flash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This white beam of light was just too quick. It seemed to descend from the heavens as it pierced right through the explosions beneath it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anybody who could see clearly would realize that this white beam adjusted its angle continuously as it flew, and it avoided the most concentrated regions of those explosions. It didn’t allow any of the explosive forces to touch it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sixteen pillars didn’t manage to eradicate all the stationary soul cannon shells in the end, and there were still some who collided with the royal palace’s protective barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, the white beam of light that seemed like a shooting star also arrived, and immediately struck the barrier’s surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tch—” Ear-piercing sounds could be heard as the white beam began to spin vigorously. It was like a drill as it impaled the royal palace’s protective barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Alarms rang out within the soul protective barrier, and the light radiating from the protective barrier grew extremely intense as it worked at maximum capacity.</span></p>
