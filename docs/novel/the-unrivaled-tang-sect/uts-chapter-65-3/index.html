 <p><strong>Book 10: Shrek's Seven Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 65.3: Mix'n'Match Battle of the Seven Monsters!</strong></p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao knew that her cultivation was too low to play a decisive role in the battle. As such, she only used her Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute. When she did, a ‘wuwu’ sound echoed throughout the surrounding area, and Ma Xiaotao’s speed was immediately reduced by a small margin.</p>
 <p>Compared to Xiao Xiao, the nearby Ling Luochen was much more powerful. When she released her martial soul, all five of her soul rings began to move rhythmically, and a layer of ice crystals covered her entire body. Immediately afterwards, the layer of ice crystals began to shine as they merged with her second soul ring, which caused her body to be encased in light blue ice armor. When the light from her teammates’ soul rings shone on it, the light was refracted and gave birth to a beautiful and radiant display of colors.</p>
 <p>Her first soul ring was the next to light up. Ling Luochen raised her right hand when it did, and made a grabbing motion. When she did, a two meter-long magical staff made of ice crystals materialized from a blue light.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, both of the soul skills she’d used so far had nothing to do with ‘control’. One had caused a magical staff to materialize, the other a suit of ice armor. Despite this, neither of these abilities seemed weak!</p>
 <p>However, Ling Luochen quickly displayed her strength. She pointed the staff towards the sky, and a layer of ice-blue light instantly enveloped the surrounding area. Afterwards, the ice-blue air rushed towards the enemy team. She didn’t use any other soul skills.</p>
 <p>As one might notice, her martial soul was nothing but ‘ice’. She had an extremely rare elemental martial soul that let her control ice.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was in the front. Therefore, she would have been the first one to suffer the effects of the wave of cold. Dai Yueheng and the others thought that she would use her phoenix flames to resist the attack. However, she did nothing of the sort. She just stopped.</p>
 <p>Given her cultivation, Ling Luochen’s ability to control ice wasn’t really a threat to her. However, ice could restrain fire. With Ling Luochen here, her phoenix flames would be weakened, and her consumption of spiritual power would also increase.</p>
 <p>But surprisingly enough, the irritable Ma Xiaotao didn’t push forward. Since she had stopped, her teammates also quickly caught up.</p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao, release your ice element aura and suppress her.” Ma Xiaotao shouted in a low voice. At this time, they were less than fifty meters away from Dai Yueheng and Chen Zifeng. And right now, they had already entered the range of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. The condition of their soul power, their speed, their movements, all the moves they were planning to do; nothing could escape Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao was still a little nervous. After all, the opposing team had four students of the inner courtyard! When Ma Xiaotao shouted that command, he mistook her intentions.</p>
 <p>Suppress her? How exactly can I suppress her? If it were a Soul Grandmaster, maybe I would be able to suppress him. But a Soul King? This is impossible!</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was much more experienced than him. Therefore, she just wanted to make him release his Ultimate ice element martial soul. Even if Ling Luochen had a powerful elemental martial soul, it was still somewhat lacking compared to an Ultimate martial soul of the ice element. Just by releasing his Ultimate ice element, he would be able to protect his teammates from Ling Luochen’s ability to control ice. Otherwise, if they were to be affected by this cold, their speed and power would drop drastically.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao didn’t know that his duty was so easy. He only had to release the martial soul of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion and spread her aura in all directions. He had turned a simple task into something very complicated.</p>
 <p><em>Sister Xiaotao, you’re asking too much of me! How should I proceed now?</em></p>
 <p>Would he allow them to say that he was a coward? Of course he wouldn’t. At this time, Huo Yuhao recalled the words that Ma Xiaotao had left on the ground. This immediately ignited his fighting spirit. A golden light flickered through his eyes. Then, his second soul ring lit up.</p>
 <p>Since Ma Xiaotao had stopped, everyone else stopped too. They all heard the order she had given to Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao took a step forward. At this time, he was standing in front of his teammates. After that, he released a piercing shriek from his mouth, and at the same time, his body also disappeared completely.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Dai Yueheng, Chen Zifeng, and the others saw that Ma Xiaotao had stopped. Therefore, they also reduced their speed. <em>If you know both yourself and your enemy, you won’t suffer defeat.</em> There was surely a reason behind the other party’s strange behavior.</p>
 <p>Then, they saw the boy called Huo Yuhao taking a step forward. And after that piercing shriek, they saw his body disappear completely. All those rays of light connected to his body also lost their luster.</p>
 <p>At this time, the wave of cold arrived where Yuhao and the others were standing. Except for Huo Yuhao, everyone else felt their bodies become cold. The temperature in the surrounding area also drastically fell.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was dumbfounded. She was just about to curse that idiotic Huo Yuhao when the surrounding scenery changed.</p>
 <p>A strange form appeared where Huo Yuhao was standing. And when it appeared, it caused the surrounding air to instantly congeal. Then, a burst of ancient, powerful and overbearing aura spread from its body.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan, who was overseeing the match from the sky, lowered his head and spurted out the alcohol in his mouth. His eyes were wide open, and almost seemed to fall from his eye sockets. Afterwards, he started to cough fiercely. The alcohol had almost caused him to choke.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s body had disappeared. And a beautiful and fearful form had appeared in his stead.</p>
 <p>It was a scorpion. A very beautiful scorpion.</p>
 <p>It was around one-and-a-half meters long, and its body had two colorations. One part had the same color as ice, while the other was a deep green.</p>
 <p>At its front, there were four overlapping layers. Each layer was slightly longer than 15 centimeters, and the head was situated on the first one. Its silver-white mouth was emitting a cold light. Moreover, the first half of these four layers was covered with strange scales.</p>
 <p>Each of these scales was hexagonal, and each and every one of them was emitting a bright light, just like protruding diamonds. Its six powerful long legs were also densely covered by these protuberances. Under the snowy radiance, they were emitting a blinding light. At this moment, it seemed as if its entire body had become a source of light; myriad different light shades were refracted from it.</p>
 <p>The two pincers in the front were each a meter long. The pincers were also covered by those protruding diamond-like hexagonal scales. They were similar to its mouth, emitting a silver-white radiance like two mirrors.</p>
 <p>However, the most eye-catching part was its two eyes. These eyes were yellow, and shining like a pair of crystals. They also had a hexagonal shape. They were emitting a bright yellow radiance, giving off an unusual feeling.</p>
 <p>If you were to think that the first half was bright enough, you still had to see the latter half. A long and dazzling tail was sticking up from its back, and this was the core of the radiance it was emanating.</p>
 <p>Unlike the many segments of a normal scorpion’s, its tail only had five. Each joint had a charming dark green color. The glittering dark green color almost seemed lifelike. These five joints all had the same color, and the closer they were close to the body, the larger they were. Likewise, the farther they were, the narrower they got. At the end of the last joint was a diamond-like stinger that was standing high up in the sky. The tip of the stinger was also emitting a silver-white luster.</p>
 <p>This soul beast, whose entire body resembled a shining precious treasure, was emitting an aura capable of making one terrified.</p>
 <p>After all, it was soul beast that had moved unhindered in the Extreme North for nearly four hundred thousand years! It was ranked second among the three emperors of the Extreme North, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion!</p>
 <p>The six people from the outer courtyard weren’t really affected. After all, they hadn’t ever encountered a first-class soul beast, and they didn’t know what the aura of a first-class soul beast looked like. In their eyes, this scorpion was nothing but a beautiful and dangerous beast.</p>
 <p>However, the students of the inner courtyard were different! After entering the inner courtyard, their classes were different from those of the outer courtyard. They had a class that took place exactly in the Great Star Dou Forest. As soon as the Ice Jace Empress Scorpion appeared, they felt an immense fear. It was the pressure of a hundred thousand year soul beast.</p>
 <p>The aura of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion exploded out, and a sense of coldness spread everywhere. That wave of cold immediately stopped midair, then began to slowly solidify. It turned into a white light that enveloped the tip of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s stinger. Those two bright yellow eyes were devoid of every emotion as they looked at the far away Ling Luochen.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen felt her body stiffen, and she couldn’t move from where she was standing. If one were to look carefully, they would notice that the ice armor covering her body had started to show signs of abnormally hardening. In addition, her feet were glued to the earth by a layer of ice. She couldn’t move anymore, and her body had started to freeze.</p>
 <p>All of this happened in an instant. While everyone was still dumbfounded due to Huo Yuhao turning into the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, Ling Luochen had already been completely subdued.</p>
 <p>“Elder Xuan, this is a hundred thousand year soul beast.” Ma Xiaotao was astonished. She quickly released her martial soul to protect the people behind her.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xiaotao, what are you doing? Quick, attack them!” A form suddenly flashed. That terrifying Ice Jade Empress Scorpion had disappeared, and Huo Yuhao had reappeared in her stead. Moreover, he was impatiently pressing forward, unaware of the fact that everyone was about to attack him. Even Elder Xuan was preparing to fight him.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” Elder Xuan shouted from midair. He descended from the sky and arrived in front of Huo Yuhao. Afterwards, he raised his right hand and grabbed him.</p>
 <p>As for resisting it… it was completely useless. Huo Yuhao was nothing but an ant in front of someone like Elder Xuan.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan’s hand held his shoulder. Then, Huo Yuhao felt a powerful soul power entering and probing every corner of his body.</p>
 <p>The quantity of soul power was too large. But luckily, Huo Yuhao’s meridians had gone through a lot tempering, and were quite strong right now. And what surprised him the most was that after experiencing Elder Xuan’s soul power, his own soul power that had reached the peak of Rank 26 suddenly broke through, allowing him to successfully reach Rank 27.</p>
