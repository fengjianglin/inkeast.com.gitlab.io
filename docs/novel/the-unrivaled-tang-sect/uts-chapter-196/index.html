 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

However, it was still slowly growing, inch by inch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it had first appeared, it was only the size of an infant’s fist. Now however, it was as big as an apple, and was slowly growing to the size of a watermelon. Its regular spherical shape had also become more and more irregular. Something seemed to be squirming inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux wore a slight smile on his face, but his body was becoming more illusory by the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The snow pearl slowly showed a strange scene. Something seemed to be moving underneath the golden, transparent film. Upon closer inspection, it seemed like a human embryo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, blood!” Electrolux shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao opened his eyes wide and spat out fresh blood, which landed on the snow pearl. Suddenly, the force within the embryo seemed to stabilize and calm down. It slowly turned into a ball of golden light that flew towards Huo Yuhao. The two sect masters stopped restricting it, because Electrolux gestured at them not to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last golden rune also flew out of Electrolux’s hand and landed accurately on the snow pearl, which had absorbed Huo Yuhao’s blood and slowly turned milky-white. As golden light flashed, the snow pearl drifted in front of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The staff in Electrolux’s hand turned into a golden streak of light, which flew out and went into Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny. Small, golden whirlpools appeared within the Eye of Destiny. Then a golden light expanded, and easily engulfed the snow pearl embryo. As lights flashed, the snow pearl disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher.” Huo Yuhao’s body jerked. Blood seeped out of his pores. His face became even paler. He was subjected to the rebound from immense forces. When everything ended, he was about to succumb to his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux smiled, “Although the remnants of my divine senses can’t store all my past memories, I know that you’re not my only disciple. However, you are very outstanding, and I’m very pleased with you. You must remember never to be extreme. If one’s heart is upright, they will be upright. No matter what strength it is, it’ll only be used for appropriate purposes in the hands of the just.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher, come back inside quickly!” Huo Yuhao exclaimed anxiously. He wanted to move towards Electrolux, but he immediately collapsed after he got off the Frigid Jade Essence Bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux sighed, “You’re a fool. Have I taught you for nothing? Can’t you feel what strength I’m using to help the Snow Empress be reborn as an embryo? It’s just a pity that she doesn’t have a body. Otherwise, I could have given her a real rebirth. Like I mentioned earlier, I don’t know what she’ll become, lose or gain, after I do this. At least you are all safe. The Snow Empress will also be tightly bound to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher.” Tears streamed down from Huo Yuhao’s eyes. Even though his internal organs were on fire and blood was seeping out of his pores, he still struggled to crawl towards Electrolux.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course he knew what strength Electrolux was using. The two golden flares had played decisive roles; they were the flames of Electrolux’s divine sense! The remnants of his divine sense had been the fuel for the flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Calamity Necromancer had used the last of his divine sense to save them. However, he didn’t inform anyone before doing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux smiled and said, “If you reach&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">that</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;stage one day, this world might really possess conditions that permit the existence of gods. You might find the remnants of my divine sense somewhere, or use the delicate connection that we have to restore the flame of my divine sense. I’ll be waiting for that day. Don’t be sad. To me, it’s not my first time dying. What’s so scary about death? Didn’t we just create a new form of life? I’m very happy. Gentlemen, please help me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His last sentence was directed at the two sect masters. The sect master lifted Huo Yuhao up from the ground. Before Huo Yuhao could catch a glimpse of what he did next, he passed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The strength of a god? You used the strength of a god just now?” The second sect master couldn’t help but ask. At this point, everything in the room had returned to normal. Only, now the Frigid Jade Essence Bed had lost its original icy qualities and become a rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux nodded slightly. “I can also feel the auras of gods from your bodies. There’s also a sense of righteousness. I don’t have much time to speak anymore. Gentlemen, please trust my judgment. My disciple is kind and sincere. He’ll be a good partner. Don’t put him in a hard spot anymore, and help me comfort him. You can tell him how he can ‘resurrect’ me from your perspectives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux smiled as he spoke till here and slowly drifted to the window. He looked far away with his elderly gaze. The sea of clouds around Clear Sky Peak was slowly being restored after being scattered by the terrifying auras earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He revealed a slight smile as he saw this magnificent view. This was probably the last time he would gaze upon this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The room was very quiet. Everything was returning to normal, as if nothing had happened at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master and second sect master were looking silently at his golden figure, it was slowly dimming. A look of respect was revealed in their eyes. Although they had only interacted with him for a short period of time, they knew that he had just sacrificed his life to save Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux was gazing into the distance, but his gaze turned dimmer and dimmer. He eventually turned into a spot of golden light that drifted towards Huo Yuhao’s forehead. It entered his head and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange-looking, greyish soul ring slowly rose from Huo Yuhao’s body. When this soul ring appeared, Electrolux’s figure flashed for an instant before disappearing. When his visage flashed, his eyes were no longer shining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second sect master was shocked as he asked, “This soul ring is grey?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master sighed and looked at Huo Yuhao in his arms. He said, “Although I don’t know the kind of experiences that divine sense from another world has gone through, I could sense the pure light and the vicissitudes of life from him. It’s really this brat’s fortune to have such a teacher! This grey soul ring is possibly the last shred of strength that his teacher left behind for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second sect master revealed an upset look on his face and muttered, “Elder brother, I miss our past life. However, we still can’t return to those days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect master smiled and said, “There are both losses and gains. We’re already quite fortunate. In fact, I’m actually eager to see what kind of existence we’ve just created. The force that erupted in Huo Yuhao’s body should belong to a soul beast, which is possibly a strong being that sealed their own powers. The seal must have encountered some kind of problem, thus leading to the risks earlier. It’s really our responsibility.” As he spoke, he pointed to the dim Frigid Jade Essence Bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second sect master snapped, “This is also considered out responsibility? We didn’t let him cultivate here, and one of our treasures was destroyed. If not for Wang Dong, I’d make him compensate us for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha.” The sect master laughed loudly and said, “Alright, what’s there to be calculative about? Go and tell everyone to return since the problem has been resolved.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was in a deep sleep. He only felt that he’d lost something important. Pain, sorrow and other emotions engulfed him in his dreams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was struggling to wake from his dream, a streak of light appeared in front of him. An elegant and ravishing beauty in a long blue dress appeared and snuggled beside him. Her hair and eyes were pinkish-blue, and she wore a look of anguish in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What? Is that the Goddess of Light?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wanted to grab hold of her, but he realized that he couldn’t do anything. The sorrow that he felt also slowly faded as the Goddess of Light appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Goddess of Light brought positivity into his mind and allowed him to relax in his sleep. There seemed to be a gentle singing voice comforting his sorrowful spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some time, Huo Yuhao woke from his sleep. When he awoke, he first felt the tremendous changes to his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least two-thirds of his vast spiritual sea had dried up. A strong feeling of weakness made it difficult for him to even open his eyes. His passageways were aching greatly too. His soul power was still there, but its circulation was very messy. If not for the purity of his Mysterious Heaven Technique, he would have been in great danger of losing control of what was left over.</span></p>

Back then, he had only suffered external injuries. However, he’d sustained internal injuries this time, including injuries to his spirit and mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the pain that came from his body made it difficult for him to think. The only thing he could do now was slowly recover from his injuries.</span></p>

However, he almost fell unconscious a few times throughout even this simple process. Although he couldn’t think deeply, he could still remember everything he had lost. That was why he still remained resolute and continued to forcibly control his soul power.</span></p>

His passageways weren’t too critically damaged, and there was even another wave of thick spiritual energy fused within his body that coordinated with the circulation of the Mysterious Heaven Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The relaxation of his body also helped him gradually recover his spiritual energy. However, Huo Yuhao was appalled to discover that his spiritual sea had been damaged to such a large extent. It was like his spiritual reservoir had shrunk to one-third its original size, causing his spiritual power to decrease greatly. Fortunately, his understanding of spiritual power still existed, and his control hadn’t faltered. As he worked hard to control and stimulate his spiritual sea, it managed to restore its circulation. The weakness that he felt also gradually faded away. He could also sense his Eye of Destiny, where his second mental sea was.</span></p>

He heaved a sigh of relief because of this. If even his Eye of Destiny was hurt, his cultivation would probably fall by at least thirty percent.</span></p>

It wasn’t entirely bad news everywhere. A ball of golden light was floating in his Eye of Destiny. A golden embryo was gestating within this ball of light. It seemed to be unable to penetrate the layer of film and come out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could also clearly sense that the part of his spiritual power that had disappeared seemed to be in this golden embryo. The strange golden embryo seemed to be closely linked to him.</span></p>

It was like another him was developing in his body. But this other self didn’t just possess his aura; it also possessed an aura that he was familiar with.</span></p>

He could only subtly sense two spiritual imprints in it, but they seemed to have been greatly hurt, and had entered a deep sleep.</span></p>

At that point in time, he had been under Electrolux’s control. He had entered a half-conscious state, and remembered very little of what happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m not dead!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Huo Yuhao’s first reaction after he could slowly control his spiritual sea. However, he was extremely mournful when he realized that there were only two spiritual imprints asleep in his spiritual sea. He didn’t know who they were, but the two that had disappeared were probably…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought till here, Huo Yuhao only felt that he was completely engulfed in sorrow. He felt extreme heartache.</span></p>

The golden light shone, and a familiar aura spread. Its appearance caught immediately Huo Yuhao’s attention.</span></p>
