 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? We’ve already been here for ten days?” After hearing her words, Huo Yuhao’s expression immediately changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After completing his fusion with Li Ya, he had clearly felt his spiritual power growing until its limit. Furthermore, he was also certain that his spiritual soul core had reached the tier of a Transcendent Douluo. He even wanted to use this opportunity to form his second soul core. This was because there was no safer place than this underwater world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after listening to the words of the Princess of the Sea, he immediately removed that thought from his head. He could not delay any further. Things outside were probably much more chaotic after ten days. He didn’t know what the situation was like at the front lines. He was also unable to deal any repeated blows to the Sun Moon Empire. The earlier strategy that he came up with was likely to be greatly affected. In addition, his teammates were also waiting anxiously in the demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t be bothered about the reluctance of the Princess of the Sea to leave her daughter right now. He quickly bade goodbye to them. Under the personal escort of the Princess of the Sea, he drifted towards the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how unwilling the Princess of the Sea was, she needed to part ways with her daughter. After the pair bade each other farewell, Li Ya fused back into Huo Yuhao’s body. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong unleashed their Class 9 flying-type soul tools and immediately activated them to reach their highest speed. They flew towards the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong grabbed Huo Yuhao’s hand tightly as she felt how tense he was. “Since time has already passed, there’s no point brooding over it. Although ten days isn’t very short, it’s also not that long over the course of a war. You don’t have to be too worried either. When we return, we can immediately begin our operation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” After this buffer period, Huo Yuhao finally calmed down. Being anxious wasn’t going to solve the problem. The best way was to continue his operation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The return journey was much smoother than coming to the Ice Sea. The entire aquatic world treated Huo Yuhao as their best human friend because of his fusion with Li Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong only took an hour before they returned to shore as they drained their soul power without any further thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a mysterious look on his face before he even stepped on land. He immediately muttered a few incantations before opening the spectral door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten days had also passed in the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan were still very emotionally stable. However, they were still a little anxious, given that a long time had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why is Huo Yuhao still not back or contacted anyone yet? Something must have happened to him. Don’t tell me that he’s met with danger in the Ice Sea?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, they couldn’t leave the demiplane without him. All they could do was wait around. If something really happened to him, they would most likely be trapped here for their entire lives, or at least until their supply of food and water ran out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as everyone was becoming more and more anxious, the spectral door finally opened, much to their relief. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had finally returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, where have you been? Why are you back only now?” Jiang Nannan snapped as she saw Huo Yuhao. It would have been great even if he had only sent a letter! Over the past ten days, they had felt very tortured. They still had to train the members of the three soul engineer legions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately called for a meeting and recounted everything he had experienced in the Ice Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, everyone stopped blaming him. They only had lingering fear in their hearts. Huo Yuhao felt the same way too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eldest senior, before I carry out any mission on my own in the future, I must first release all of you from this demiplane. Otherwise, if I...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, quit this depressing talk. Now is not the time to talk about that. What should we do next? Do you have any ideas?” Bei Bei said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and opened up a map. He said, “I’ve been delayed in the Ice Sea for ten days. It’s both a good and bad thing. Because of this ten day buffer, the Sun Moon Empire will definitely subconsciously think that we passed through their borders in the same manner as when we appeared in the south, just that we used some kind of method to avoid their aerial surveillance soul tools. We must be quick, and deal them a heavier blow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xu Tianran is an anti-hero. If we don’t inflict pain that’s intolerable on him, he won’t pull his troops from the front lines easily. That’s why we must be quick and vicious. I just don’t know what the situation at the front line is right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Huo Yuhao could return to Shrek Academy to gather intelligence. Under such a circumstance, returning to gather intelligence was meaningless. He would waste more time if he went there and returned. Even if he knew what was going on at the front lines, wouldn’t he still need to return to target the Sun Moon Empire if he wanted to change the situation of the war?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why Huo Yuhao quickly figured that he needed to stay and continue to inflict internal damage on the Sun Moon Empire. In that way, they would be forced to pull their troops back. This was the real strategy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a simple communication of the plan to the rest, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong left the demiplane again after the meeting ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, the three soul engineer legions in the demiplane should be let out for a short breather. However, time was tight. There was a lack of time for them to do so. Only news of Huo Yuhao’s return was relayed to them, and they were allowed to watch as Huo Yuhao left again. At the same time, they were informed that the next fight was about to break out again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that a fight was about to break out soon, the members of the three soul engineer legions all rubbed their palms in excitement. Their morale was boosted once again, which left Huo Yuhao in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Huo Yuhao didn’t know was that Bei Bei had set up a merit system while he had been gone. The main point of this system was to reward those who contributed significantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The resources, gems and gold soul coins that they had obtained earlier were mostly given out by Bei Bei. Bei Bei told every soul engineer in the three soul engineer legions that they would be handsomely rewarded once they attained victory in any fight. They could choose from gold soul coins, soul tools, and other resources. As for how much they were rewarded, it depended on the merit they accumulated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After setting this system up, he immediately handed out rewards. Over the past ten days, morale didn’t fall because of the presence of these rewards. In addition, with the news that they were about to fight, how could these soul engineers not be excited, given the potential benefits they could reap?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul engineers were all intelligent. Many of them chose not to take gold soul coins. Almost all of them wanted soul tools. From the earlier looting sessions they had participated in, which soul engineer didn’t manage to equip himself with more soul tools? The stronger a soul engineer was, the more advantages he would have. This was because more advanced soul tools could only be used by stronger soul engineers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Fort Soul Engineer Legion reaped the greatest rewards. The Fort Soul Engineer Legion inherited all the heavy soul tools they had looted in the fights earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other two soul engineer legions had no use for these heavy soul tools. Since this was the case, the Fort Soul Engineer Legion didn’t stand on ceremony, and took control of all the heavy soul tools. After all, Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons couldn’t move very quickly. What was the disadvantage of having more heavy weapons? As a result, the Fort Soul Engineer Legion’s strength grew the most. It was just that they became more and more inflexible as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After leaving the demiplane, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong held hands as they rose into the sky. They proceeded towards the south of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they flew in the air, Huo Yuhao also unleashed his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The overall size of his spiritual sea had grown by a third. His soul core and spiritual power had also changed dramatically. The most direct benefit that he obtained was that his Spiritual Detection’s effective range had reached a diameter of more than twenty thousand meters, twice what it was before. This number even exceeded the effective range of the most advanced aerial surveillance soul tool that the Sun Moon Empire could manufacture. Just this skill could be considered an absolute divine skill in war!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, Huo Yuhao found many soldiers from the Sun Moon Empire in the wilderness. They were scattered, and seemed to be searching for something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While things were bleak in Eastern Sun City, the city wasn’t too chaotic. However, no soul engineer legion was present there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like the Sun Moon Empire has responded quite quickly. Rations should have been sent to re-supply Eastern Sun City. Otherwise, things wouldn’t be so stable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t going to attack Eastern Sun City at this point. The benefits that could be reaped from so were very small. Furthermore, that would only serve to expose his tracks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He unleashed his Imitation, which concealed both him and Tang Wutong in the air. Under the effect of Huo Yuhao’s immense spiritual power, even oscillation detectors couldn’t detect his presence now, much less aerial surveillance soul tools. As for spiritual power detectors, they could at most cover the size of a military camp. Huo Yuhao had made himself completely invisible to the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They flew quickly through the air. Huo Yuhao didn’t rest at all as he flew with Tang Wutong. They flew for four hours before they slowed down and returned to the ground to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao opened the map and conducted a simple check of where they were. Through the changes in the air temperature, Huo Yuhao was completely sure that they were in the south of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
