 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan was momentarily stunned. He forced a laugh and said, “I’m afraid that’s a little difficult. The areas close to those soul tool forts are heavily guarded, and well-equipped with all sorts of surveillance soul tools. It’s almost impossible to do something around them without being discovered. Are you guys ready to make your move?” A worried expression appeared on his face as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “You don’t have to worry, Third Elder. We will give you a way out even when we execute our plan. You have to help me find such a place as fast as possible, and if it really isn’t possible, a location slightly further away from those soul tool forts is also acceptable, but it has to be further away from where we are. Only then can we move according to our plan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan knew that he no longer had a choice. He was most afraid of Huo Yuhao’s identity being revealed, because Huo Yuhao had returned with him as the Masquerade Douluo. Nangong Wan would also be exposed if Huo Yuhao was discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’ll try my best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan scurried away after dinner. He was much more familiar with the situation inside the army camp than Huo Yuhao was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan came to Huo Yuhao’s tent to find him after two hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s a solution, Tang Wu.” Nangong Wan still thought Huo Yuhao was Tang Wu up even now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned and replied, “Call me Masquerade.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan froze for a moment. “Alright, Masquerade, I think we have an opportunity, and it’s quite a good one at that. The Holy Ghost Church has the authority to supervise and survey the army. The Supreme Leader has just passed the order for us to patrol several soul tool forts tomorrow afternoon. The two forts that belong the Hand that Protects the Nation’s two soul engineer legions are a little more troublesome because they don’t show us much respect. The other three forts that are responsible for defense that belong to normal soul engineer legions are more polite toward us. Why don’t we take a trip down together, so you can find an opportunity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was elated when he heard the news. “That’s fantastic, let’s do it then. Tell the Supreme Leader that I will accompany you on patrol tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright,” Nangong Wan acknowledged, and he hesitated before he then continued, “If you execute your plan tomorrow, what happens to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered, “Don’t worry, I’ll find an appropriate solution for you. When everything happens, I’ll fake my death, and all you have to do is pretend you have no idea about anything. As for the restrictions on your body, we will help you remove them once we fully execute our plan. You’re a smart man, and you should understand that something bad will happen to you if you foil our plan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan hurriedly said, “Of course, of course. Don’t worry, as long as you keep your promise to remove my restrictions, I will help you as much as possible even if you look for me again next time.” Nangong Wan had taken Huo Yuhao, the “Masquerade Douluo”, back together with him, and that meant he had a hold on Nangong Wan. Huo Yuhao wasn’t at all worried that Nangong Wan would expose him in their operation. As for what would happen afterwards, Huo Yuhao didn’t consider that too seriously. Who knew how things would unfold? How could Nangong Wan follow his instructions if there wasn’t something to threaten him with?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But rescuing Tang Ya was of utmost importance for everyone from Shrek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately sealed his tent with a spiritual barrier once he escorted Nangong Wan away before swiftly summoning his spectral gate and began to discuss his plan with his companions. The most important component of his plan was executable with Nangong Wan’s intel, and the next step was to iron out the rest of the plan perfectly. They would act tomorrow night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao returned to his tent after discussing inside his spectral demiplane for two hours. His spiritual barrier was very normal, and wasn’t triggered at all, but Huo Yuhao didn’t rest. Instead, he conjured another spiritual avatar and sent it out of his tent. He followed the path that he had scouted out several days ago as he swiftly left the camp and disappeared into the distance. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools that pointed outside covered every corner, but not every kind of soul tool could do that task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao found a few loopholes after investigating for two days. His spiritual avatar wasn’t afraid of thermal detectors, and he also had help from Imitation. Huo Yuhao evaded the oscillation detectors and spiritual detectors before he slipped out of the camp and went straight for Heaven Dou City. His spiritual avatar was carrying the signal soul tool that Princess Wei Na had given him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual avatar returned quietly after two hours, and slipped back into the army camp with the same method as it swiftly returned to his tent and integrated back into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Preparations were mostly complete, and the next step had to be left until tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was late into the night, and Huo Yuhao glanced in the direction of Tang Ya’s tent before he closed his eyes and began to meditate. He had to maintain his peak spiritual condition for tomorrow’s operation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao got up very early in the morning, and cultivated his Purple Demon Eyes before he proceeded towards the canteen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was walking when he suddenly sensed something, and subconsciously turned to look back. He saw Tang Ya, who was calmly walking in the same direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had seen Tang Ya a few times over the past two days, but Tang Ya almost never spoke with anyone. She was like a statue, or rather, she was like the walking dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao was sure that Tang Ya hadn’t completely lost her consciousness. Otherwise, what use would this Holy Lady be for the Holy Ghost Church in the future? The Holy Ghost Church was probably hoping that she and Ma Xiaotao would carry the Holy Ghost Church forward. How would that be possible if they were just puppets?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holy Lady,” Huo Yuhao stopped and walked over to Tang Ya as he bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey,” Tang Ya nodded, but she still responded as coldly as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao thought she would walk past him to eat, Tang Ya suddenly stopped and turned around to face him. She said coldly, “Seventh Elder, your aura seems to have changed. Are you having any problems with cultivation recently?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Huo Yuhao’s heart skipped a beat. This was the first time that he had heard Tang Ya speak after coming into this place undercover. Tang Ya’s voice wasn’t very different from back then, but her voice no longer had any emotions, like she was just a machine talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Holy Lady, what kind of changes are you talking about?” Huo Yuhao’s mind was very stable. He wasn’t caught off-guard by the sudden change in circumstances, and he asked her a question instead with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya seemed taken aback as she frowned and said, “I can’t quite put a finger on it. I just find that your aura has become more intimate than before, like there’s more familiarity. You’re not as despicable as before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh…” Tang Ya didn’t attempt to mask her feelings when she said that she despised the Masquerade Douluo. That surprised Huo Yuhao, because even though Tang Ya was the Holy Lady, she was just a Soul Douluo! She wasn’t polite at all to this “Elder”.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bluesilver.” An elderly voice could be heard at this moment. Huo Yuhao felt his entire body tense up when he heard this voice, and he hurriedly took a few steps back as he spoke respectfully to where that voice was coming from. “Greetings, Supreme Leader!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Didn’t that old voice belong to the Holy Ghost Church’s Supreme Leader, Zhongli Wu?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya wasn’t as reverent as Huo Yuhao was. Instead, she simply bowed faintly as a gesture in Zhongli Wu’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu came up beside Tang Ya and removed the hood on his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time that Huo Yuhao had a look at the Holy Ghost Church’s Supreme Leader at such close proximity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s hair was short and silvery, very thin and dense, and very sharp and tough, like steel needles. His eyebrows were thick, his eyes were bright, and he was actually extremely handsome. His eyes were dark purple, and exuded a faint deep and profound aura. Nobody could tell he was an evil soul master just by looking at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked very young, and if not for his silver hair, he would have passed for a middle-aged man. But Huo Yuhao knew that Zhongli Wu was only one generation younger than his teacher, Mu En, and the Death God Douluo, Ye Xishui. He was probably more than a hundred and eighty years old, yet he still looked very young.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t say much,” Tang Ya responded coldly to Zhongli Wu’s doubts, and Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu smiled faintly and said, “Are you still hating on Seventh Elder? He didn’t mean to scare you back then. I didn’t expect you hold grudges. I’ve already instructed him not to unleash his Demonic Maggot in front of you, no matter what, so you don’t have to worry. Come, let’s eat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu immediately grabbed Tang Ya’s hand as he spoke, and they walked towards the canteen.</span></p>

But he’s already a hundred and eighty years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao watched Zhongli Wu and Tang Ya walk towards the canteen, and he could only grit his teeth and follow at the back to prevent any suspicion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu suddenly stopped walking at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt his heart skip a beat.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has he discovered something?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu turned around to look at Huo Yuhao and said, “Masquerade, you cannot come along. The Blusilver Holy Lady doesn’t have much of an appetite with you around. Go back, and have your meal later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was overjoyed when he heard those words, and he bowed respectfully toward Zhongli Wu like a great burden had been lifted from his chest before he turned to leave.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who wants to eat with you guys!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao swiftly returned to his tent, and exhaled deeply once he stepped in.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was so close! Teacher Xiao Ya seems to have discovered something. Fortunately, she seems a little dense and inarticulate, and she didn’t bring it up to Zhongli Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Huo Yuhao, the safest choice right now would be to run away as quickly as possible so that he could prevent any unforeseen dangers. But could he really leave? Everything that he had prepared and worked for would be wasted if he did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t leave, so I’m going to take a chance. I have to bet that Teacher Xiao Ya hasn’t recognized me, and she hasn’t mentioned anything to Zhongli Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but feel a little nervous as his thoughts stopped there. Everything that he had worked for would be wasted if he was discovered now, and he would also find himself trapped in dire danger.</span></p>
