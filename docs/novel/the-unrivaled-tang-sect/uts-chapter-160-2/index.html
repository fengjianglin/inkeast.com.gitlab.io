If it were possible, he hoped that the two-and-a-half years would pass quickly, so that he could return to Shrek and reunite with his friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he thought of his friends, he couldn’t help but miss Wang Dong. He didn’t wake Wang Dong up the day that they separated. However, Huo Yuhao could clearly remember the tears in Wang Dong’s eyes. Wang Dong had even muttered his name in his dreams, and begged him not to leave. His voice had even seemed to…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s heart was a mess when he reached this point. Wang Dong’s figure and the ravishing beauty formed from the Rainment of Light’s transformation appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These messy thoughts made him filled with yearning for Shrek Academy. Was eldest senior fine? Did he find Teacher Xiao Ya yet? How was the relationship between third and fourth seniors? Fifth senior Xiao Xiao had also seemed a little different before he left with second senior. As for Wang Dong, he’d discover the truth about him when he returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next morning.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had changed his attire; his current ordinary attire made him seem like an ordinary kid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun had already risen halfway in the east. He’d also finished cultivating his Purple Demon Eyes. He’d made the quickest progress in the Purple Demon Eyes among all of the Tang Sect’s Secret Techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were four different levels of the Purple Demon Eyes: Surveyance, Totality, Mustard Seed, and Boundlessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was already at the third level, Mustard Seed. He’d managed to reach this level using his Spiritual Detection to research the ability to focus. He was also the first to reach the Mustard Seed level among everyone in the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Shrek Academy’s senior management didn’t know that Huo Yuhao’s greatest offensive strength didn’t lie in his Ultimate Ice or Darkgolden Terrorclaw. Rather, it was his immense spiritual power that could be used through the combination of his Purple Demon Eyes and Spiritual Shock. His irresistible spiritual power was the reason why he could fight beyond his level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, two graceful-looking figures drifted into view. They were walking very quickly, and reached Huo Yuhao quite quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi had changed into a white dress, which accentuated her figure. Her silky-white skin looked much brighter, as it was complemented by her white attire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke was dressed in green, and looked very neat. Although her figure wasn’t as good as Ju Zi’s, it was still very proportionate, her dress making her look more vibrant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them weren’t kind when they saw Huo Yuhao. Ke Ke placed her hands on her waist and said, “It’s all your fault that we have to go out again. Teacher Xuan said that you have to listen to the both of us when we’re out. If you dare to try anything, the academy will expel you and immediately send you back to Shrek Academy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little annoyed, thus he shrugged his shoulders. He simply gestured for them to advance, but didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi glanced at him and said, “Let’s go. We’re heading to the Jing Yang Mountain Range. There are many soul beasts there. We should forget our conflict back in the academy and work together on this journey. You’re the only male here, thus you should protect us well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little stunned as he looked at Ju Zi. He hadn’t expected her temperament to change so much. He nodded and said, “Okay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke was annoyed after hearing Huo Yuhao’s short reply and said, “Hey, you’re taking this attitude even though Sister Ju Zi is being so nice to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “Am I supposed to be grateful? The two of you were bullying me just yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke glare grew even wider. It was as if she’d just heard something ridiculous. “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">We</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;bullied&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">you</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">? Wang Shaojie is still unconscious, while Zimu’s injury is still quite serious. Who bullied who?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered, “I was just defending myself. Could you take it if someone calls you a bastard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke wanted to say more, but was stopped by Ju Zi, “Alright, let’s go. Huo Yuhao, Teacher Xuan indeed said that I’m the leader for this trip. Don’t worry, I won’t take revenge on you for what happened earlier. It’s one thing to have conflicts in the academy, but even though you’re an exchange student, you’re still part of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. You’re even leaving the academy to experiment on soul tools on its behalf. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once she’d finished speaking, she forced Ke Ke to walk in front. Ke Ke turned to look at Huo Yuhao. “Can you use a flying-type soul tool despite your three rings?” A pair of wings flapped open behind her as she spoke. Her toes pointed upwards, and two blue flames spewed out from her wings, which quickly propelled her into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi also turned back to look at Huo Yuhao, asking him the same question with her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t speak, but a simple, greyish pair of wings flapped open behind his back. A gentle white light shot out and propelled him into the sky. Even though he wasn’t a Class 6 soul engineer in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, he still had a flying-type soul tool with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi’s flying-type soul tool was orangish-red; she seemed to love this color. Three pairs of wings flapped in the air and headed towards the south.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the difference in their soul tools was revealed. Ju Zi and Ke Ke seemed very relaxed as they flew in front. However, they were still very fast. Their wings even released a layer of dim light that formed a film on the surface of their bodies. Even their hair swayed in the wind as they flew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, on the other hand, was lagging behind them. Although he tried his best to propel his self-made Class 5 flying-type soul tool, he couldn’t catch up, and thus was still depleting more soul power than the other two, who would slow down to wait for him so that he didn’t get separated from the group.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke was delighted. Every time they waited for Huo Yuhao, her eyes held a look of disdain and mockery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t react to this. He knew how inferior he was in terms of soul tools, and that it wasn’t something that he could make up for in such a short period of time. However, he memorized the structures and formation arrays of their soul tools as they flew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Ziwen didn’t conduct practicals for him, thus he had to find real-life examples to test his theories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even now, Huo Yuhao didn’t know exactly where the Jing Yang Mountain Range was. He was fine just following the both of them. However, he could make a rough guess from Ju Zi’s words. The Jing Yang Mountain Range had many soul beasts. Was this an arrangement that Teacher Xuan had made so that he could get his fourth soul ring? That was highly probable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After flying for two hours, Huo Yuhao expressed that he needed to rest. Afterwards, he flew downwards, disregarding the other two’s opinions. He still had some soul power left, but he wouldn’t deplete it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He found a suitable place to rest as he descended. Once he landed, he immediately sat cross-legged and entered a meditative state to restore his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi and Ke Ke landed after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke stuck out her tongue at Huo Yuhao. “Wasn’t he arrogant before? His soul engineer standard is just average. He can’t be arrogant anymore, can he? Sister Ju Zi, you’re right. With enough distance between us, this fellow wouldn’t be our match.”</span></p>

She appeared to be thinking of something.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao left a deep impression on her—not because of his Darkgolden Terrorclaws, but because of his punch towards Zimu’s soul shield.</span></p>

She’d seen the extremely wise, intelligent and powerful Zimu be unable to even handle his strike, and collapse after just one punch.</span></p>

How magical was this young fellow from Shrek Academy?</span></p>

However, she clearly felt that he wasn’t just some random three-ringed soul master. There must be some secret to him. Shrek Academy was indeed mysterious!</span></p>

We have to stick together since we’re on the same trip. There are bound to be conflicts. If we meet danger and can’t work together, won’t we just be harming ourselves? Let’s take a break too.” Ju Zi pulled Ke Ke and sat down.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, Huo Yuhao’s restoration left both of them shocked. It only took 15 minutes before he opened his eyes, looking refreshed.</span></p>

He’d only managed to reach Rank 40 with Elder Mu’s help before he passed on. His improvement was slow even though he’d had the help of the Haodong Power and worked very hard on his cultivation. However, it wasn’t that simple. His soul power was extremely dense, much more than that of any ordinary soul master’s. More importantly, his endurance in battle and regenerative abilities were greater than most soul masters at the same level as him.</span></p>
