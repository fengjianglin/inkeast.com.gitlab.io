The two of them have been watching you ever since you returned. Isn’t this obvious enough? Furthermore, both of them are always mumbling to themselves when they see you. They wear resentful looks whenever they look at you! Nan Qiuqiu is more obvious than Ye Guyi. However, Ye Guyi spends more time looking at you compared to Nan Qiuqiu. I don’t know what’s so good about you. Why are all the beauties interested in you instead of me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because you’re ugly,” Ji Juechen said from one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi snorted furiously. “Are you trying to embarrass me? Can’t you just play along?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen flipped his hand and whipped out his Judgment Sword, “Do you want to play?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi snorted, “I’m not scared of you. Little junior, since there’s a river here, there are naturally fish here as well. Why don’t you make some fish soup for us? I know how good you are. You haven’t demonstrated your cooking skills in a while. Since you have such a good opportunity now, go on and take it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked, “What? Are you really going to spar with Brother Ji?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi said delightfully, “No, I’m going to settle him. I already have seven rings now, I’m not scared of him anymore. Old Ji, see how I’m going to settle you today. Come on, let’s go to one side and spar!” Usually, he avoided Ji Juechen. However, today was an exception. He had just become a Soul Sage, and just fused with a Golden Tortoise. How could he resist challenging Ji Juechen? After all, he had an extroverted personality to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen didn’t expect Xu Sanshi to readily agree with his request. His eyes flashed before he turned around and walked towards an empty clearing that wasn’t very far away. He used his actions to prove his words, that he wasn’t just taunting Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt a little helpless as he shook his head. He turned around and walked towards the river. If Tang Wutong weren’t around, Huo Yuhao might still not have taken the initiative to cook. It wasn’t that he was unwilling to cook for everyone else, i was because he didn’t want Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu to misunderstand his actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, things were different now. Tang Wutong was around now. He wanted to do what they used to do before to jolt her memories. As for Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu, they shouldn’t overthink it since Tang Wutong was around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he walked to the side of the river, Huo Yuhao rolled up his trousers before he walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few ladies who were washing themsleves immediately threw furious glances at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu was displeased as she said, “Hey, you’ve dirtied the river water.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little annoyed as he replied, “Student, please watch carefully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m the one swimming in the water. I’m not even complaining about the water that you’ve used to clean yourself. If you’re good enough, don’t eat the food that I’m going to cook later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had already started as he spoke. He didn’t even need any tools. His hands were his tools. He gently pressed his hands against the river’s surface before making a flinging motion outward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a small fish around twenty centimeters long shot out of the water. The ripples that it generated looked extremely captivating under the sunset glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Small fish started to jump towards the shore one after another, landing on the shore. In a matter of seconds, more than ten small fish were already onshore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five ladies were stunned when they saw what Huo Yuhao was doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t difficult for them to catch fish from the river, given their cultivations. However, Huo Yuhao was extremely swift and accurate, without making a single mistake. The gentle suction force that he produced also didn’t cause too much river water to splash around. His every movement would force a small fish to accurately shoot out of the water towards the shore, increasing the difficulty level of catching them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the time he entered the river until he went back onshore, including the time he used to converse with Nan Qiuqiu, he only took two minutes to finish catching all the fish he needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he returned to shore, he sat down by the riverside. As he waved his right hand, a small fish landed in it. Jade-green light flashed before his Life Guardian Blade jumped out in between his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The life aura of his Life Guardian Blade retracted under Huo Yuhao’s control. During this process, green lights flashed a few times, and a small fish was completely de-scaled. He then proceeded to wash the fish in the river before throwing it into a pot beside him</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao finished de-scaling and cleaning all the fish in less than ten minutes. He was very sharp and neat during the entire process. Everything felt very smooth and natural.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five ladies, including Tang Wutong, were all drawn over. As for the fight that had just begun on the other side, they were completely uninterested. Even Jiang Nannan, who was already familiar with Huo Yuhao’s capabilities, was attracted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to before, Huo Yuhao was much faster now. They were all either Soul Emperors or Soul Sages. Naturally, they were much more observant than ordinary people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could clearly see that only the backs of the gills and tails of the fish were slit, apart from a single cut in the belly of every fish. These two slits were made to remove the tendons of the fish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from these slits and cuts, the small fish weren’t treated in any other way. However, they were completely de-scaled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything happened too quickly and cleanly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao started retrieving all types of bottles from his storage-type soul tool. He didn’t even measure or take a closer look at the amount of seasonings he was using before he started treating the fish in the pot. Four or five of the fish were removed beforehand, and weren’t seasoned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of the condiments were very heavy in taste, while some were very refreshing. When they were mixed together, they seemed to create a very special fragrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan had tasted Huo Yuhao’s grilled fish once before, but she only a little. Nan Qiuqiu had also tasted one before, but Ye Guyi had naturally not tried his grilled fish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong squatted to one side and observed Huo Yuhao. She was filled with curiosity. She could naturally tell that he was whipping up a meal for everyone.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But can he cook? Will it be delicious? He looks like a chef!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Don’t tell me that this fellow is also very impressive at cooking? Is he really talented in every aspect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very quickly, Huo Yuhao finished seasoning all the fish. After that, he started to mix the spices with the fishes in the pot. In addition, he even rubbed them in the fish’s bellies. Not only were the fish seasoned on the outside, but they were also seasoned inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled as he asked, “Can someone get me some tree branches? I need some that are about as thick as a pinky and around forty centimeters long. Their thickness must be uniform. I will also need some firewood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you move fast, we can have our meal earlier.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was stunned for a moment. Before she could even react, Ye Guyi had already opened her mouth, “I’ll do it.” Even as she said it, she had already stood up and quickly walked towards trees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu glanced at Tang Wutong. Seeing that she wasn’t moving, she was slightly stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Has she really lost her memory? Why hasn’t she reacted to Sister Guyi’s action?</span></p>

When Ye Guyi said that she was going to help Huo Yuhao, she suddenly felt a little disappointed. However, she was adamant about not helping him!</span></p>

You always use this same recipe when you want to give us a treat! Don’t you have anything new?”</span></p>

However, where can we find greens in this remote area? I’ll make some dry rations for everyone later. We can also eat something beforehand. Fourth senior, my family was very poor when we were young. We were only able to catch one or two fish occasionally and improve the quality of our meals. I’m not too good at whipping up other dishes. It was already very rare for me to eat fish when I was young.”</span></p>

Ye Guyi started the fire personally. She used her Holy Fire to light up the firewood, a sight that would no doubt make any evil soul masters who saw it throw up blood!</span></p>

Huo Yuhao didn’t rush to grill the fish. Rather, he waited quietly. The fish had to be marinated longer so that they would taste better. He wasn’t in a hurry.</span></p>

Xu Sanshi focused his gaze, and a layer of dark gold light surrounded his body. Behind him, a huge Golden Tortoise projection surfaced in the air.
