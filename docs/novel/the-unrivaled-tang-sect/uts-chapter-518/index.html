 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were forged from more than forty different natural treasures! But there were only seven pills?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but frown at the number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect’s inner circle had more than seven people. Besides Shrek’s Seven Monsters, there was Xuan Ziwen, Gao Dalou, Na Na, Ye Guyi, Ji Juechen, Jing Ziyan, and Nan Qiuqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only seven pills, so who would get one, and who wouldn’t? Furthermore, this Qiankun Fortune Pill was claimed to contain the good fortune of heaven and earth, and it could completely change a person’s body and soul. The reason why Huo Yuhao had insisted on making these was because he had hoped for the Qiankun Fortune Pill to improve Tang Ya’s body. Even though it wouldn’t release her life energy like the Bluesilver Emperor would, but if it could rely on its fortune of heaven and earth to completely change her body, then it could guarantee that her life wouldn’t be in danger, at least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there were only seven pills, so dividing them was a tough problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong could see what Huo Yuhao saw. She squeezed his hand and whispered, “Don’t worry, Yuhao. At least the forging was successful. Let’s get everyone together to discuss how to divide this. I won’t take one. After all, I already have eight soul rings, and our cultivation speed isn’t that slow, as we can cultivate together with Haodong power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s words were like water from a clear spring that rinsed Huo Yuhao’s anxious and restless heart. He pulled her tightly into his embrace and said, “What else is there to want but a lover like you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strangely, Tang Wutong’s seal didn’t act up this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took out a jade bottle and put all seven pills inside, and only then did he open the gate to the laboratory and walk out with Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was startled just as he stepped out. A large mass of the Tang Sect’s disciples were seated outside; it looked like almost every single one of them was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thick and aromatic smell of medicinal fragrance wafted out once the lab’s door was open, and permeated the entire Soul Tool Hall’s underground foundations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and the others hurriedly came forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is the pill-forging successful, little junior brother?” Bei Bei asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “Don’t worry, eldest senior brother, it’s successful. But…” A bitter smile appeared on his face as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei felt his heart skip a beat. “What’s wrong?” Huo Yuhao had already wasted four months so that he could forge this batch of pills! At least, it was a waste from Bei Bei’s perspective, because Huo Yuhao could achieve excellent results if he had used the past four months to cultivate. However, Huo Yuhao didn’t hesitate to spend his precious time on the Tang Sect. Everyone was full of gratitude, even though they didn’t say much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao whispered, “There’s too few. Let’s speak outside, eldest senior brother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei immediately understood as he nodded and said without changing his expression, “All of the Tang Sect’s disciples, remain here to cultivate and absorb the medicinal effects. Everyone above the status of vice-Hall Master, follow me out for a meeting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone stepped out one after another as they arrived inside the Tang Sect’s conference hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s face was a little pale because he was too tired. The others didn’t know that the number of pills that he had forged was very few, but everyone could tell from his and Bei Bei’s expressions that something was wrong, that a problem had occurred with the pill-forging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and Tang Ya sat in the seats of honor, while Huo Yuhao and Xuan Ziwen sat beside them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded in Huo Yuhao’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had to take responsibility at a time like this, and he stood up and said, “Teacher Xuan, my senior brothers and sisters, the pill-forging was successful. I have used the natural treasures that I brought back from the Yin Yang Icefire Well, and I forged them into a batch of pills. This pill is called the Qiankun Fortune Pill, and it’s the best kind of pill that the Tang Sect’s ancestor, Tang San, recorded in his archives. It is claimed to contain the good fortune of heaven and earth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took out the jade bottle as he spoke and placed it on the tabletop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s eyes fell on the jade bottle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is my first attempt, but all of the medicines and herbs were only enough to make this one batch. Therefore, I don’t know how strong the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects are going to be. But there’s a problem with the number of pills forged, because there’s only seven complete ones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seven?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was momentarily stunned when they heard that number, and the conference hall immediately fell silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single one of them knew from the benefit they had gained from the thick medicinal aroma from before that Huo Yuhao’s pill was out of the ordinary, but nobody expected that there would only be seven. There were already more than ten individuals seated here. How could they divide the pills if there were only seven?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right in this moment, Xuan Ziwen suddenly stood up and said, “You guys can decide among yourselves how you wish to split the pills. I’m already old, so I don’t need to eat this thing. Besides, I’m already a Class 9 soul engineer, and I don’t have a long future of growth ahead of me. I’ll go back to the Soul Tool Hall to check on how those little fellows are doing with their cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s expression was very sincere and decisive. There were only seven pills from the batch, and he was the first who chose to give up his claim. He was very clear about these pills’ value, and he had also helped Huo Yuhao complete the pill furnace. However, he knew that these extremely valuable pills would be much more effective for youngsters, and that was the reason why he chose to relinquish his claim without any hesitation at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such noble character and unquestionable integrity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, teacher Xuan. Please wait for a moment, and let me finish.” Huo Yuhao stopped Xuan Ziwen and didn’t let him leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was momentarily stunned as he glanced at Huo Yuhao, and a questioning look appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head lightly at him and said, “Please let me finish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen had given so much blood and sweat, and he had contributed so much so that the Tang Sect could be where they were today. He probably contributed more than anybody else here. When Huo Yuhao first began to forge the Qiankun Fortune Pill, he had already decided that Teacher Xuan had to get one, even if it would only serve to prolong his life and promote his longevity. Sometimes, affection and sentiment couldn’t be measured with profit or benefit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s eyes turned to Huo Yuhao. Everybody was selfish, especially in front of natural treasures such as this. But selfishness had to be distinguished with circumstance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect was built upon everyone’s teamwork and unity ever since their establishment to the scale that they were at today. Every single one of them depended on and was attached to this group, and they were full of affection for each other as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody wanted these external objects to affect their love for each other, which didn’t come easy. At a time like this, Huo Yuhao, who was the one who had brought back all these natural treasures, and who was also the one who had put in so much effort so that these pills could be forged, was undoubtedly the person who was most worthy of deciding how they would be divided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao just stood there as he briefly calmed his emotions before he lowered his voice and said, “This bottle contains seven pills in total. I’m the one who made them, and the number is limited. Let me decide how to split them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had the same reaction to Huo Yuhao taking the initiative to speak those words, but they were more even more relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the typical manner that the Tang Sect did things, there was usually a democratic discussion when something big came up. But there were so many of them, but only seven pills, so how were they to be divided? Huo Yuhao took the initiative to shoulder this responsibility, so everyone felt more relieved. At least, whether or not they would receive a pill in the end, they didn’t have to shoulder that responsibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait.” Huo Yuhao was just about to continue when Bei Bei suddenly stood up and interrupted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around to look at Bei Bei, and Bei Bei stared at him deeply and said, “Before Yuhao divides these pills, let me say a few words. No matter how these seven pills are going to be divided, nobody can object. The truth is, Yuhao has forged these seven pills all by himself, and we cannot use our emotions or our affections to split them. Instead, we should divide these pills based on our contributions. Teacher Xuan needs to have one. Without the pill furnace that came up with, this batch wouldn’t even be here today. Yuhao, I hope that you will be as fair as you can when you divide these pills. Every single person here is a part of the Tang Sect, and the Tang Sect wouldn’t be here without everyone. Whatever your decision is will be the Tang Sect’s common consensus.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was too familiar with Huo Yuhao. He said those words because he knew that Huo Yuhao was shouldering all the responsibility by taking the initiative to divide these pills. There were seven pills, so some would receive one, while others wouldn’t. Would those that didn’t receive one feel resentful? That resentment would be projected onto the person who had decided the split. That was the reason why Bei Bei emphasized that, because he didn’t want Huo Yuhao to bear this responsibility alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s heart was actually in a lot of pain. He was the Tang Set’s main director, and he was the only one who was worthy enough to request the responsibility of dividing the pills from Huo Yuhao among everyone here. But he couldn’t do that, because if he had that responsibility, he couldn’t give one to himself or to Xiao Ya to show that he was being fair. But, even if he didn’t want one, what about Tang Ya? He was truly hoping that this pill could prolong her life! Therefore, he gritted his teeth, and didn’t make that request in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded in Bei Bei’s direction before he turned back to everyone. The faint smile on his face was still there. “Eldest senior brother, you don’t have to be so nervous. The truth is, even though there are so few pills, it’s not that difficult to split them. Everyone might have misunderstood that seven pills can only be divided among seven people. You guys are thinking that there’s more than ten of us here, so about half of us won’t get any? Actually, it’s not like that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know how strong the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects are, but the level of natural treasures contained absolutely cannot be replicated, and it’s not too much to call them God-level herbs. Since that’s the case, why do we have to take one pill each? One person taking one pill each might even be counterproductive. We can always split one pill among several people. It’s also less dangerous that way, and we can be fairer to everyone. Isn’t that great? Therefore, you don’t have to be nervous, everyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was first taken aback when they heard Huo Yuhao’s words, but their expressions immediately relaxed in the next moment. Wasn’t that right? Who decided that one pill could only go to one person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was also momentarily stunned before he laughed out loud.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! I wasn’t thinking straight because I was too concerned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao saw that everyone had become more relaxed before he nodded and said with a straight face, “The Qiankun Fortune Pills have been forged, and what we have to do next is try them out. There are records in the archives that the Qiankun Fortune Pills contain the good fortune of heaven and earth, and we really don’t know what they can do with such a vague and broad description. Therefore, I have decided to test it first, to see how strong the medicinal effects are, then I’ll decide how to divide it. Everyone who’s seated here cannot escape, and everyone will test the pills with me. I will take one from the seven and dissolve it in water before dividing it equally for everyone. We will feel the medicinal effects together and see exactly to what extent they affect us. Of course, that doesn’t include teacher Xiao Ya. Her body is weak, so she will use it only after we finish testing its effects. We will decide how to divide the remaining six pills after we have finished testing them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone nodded at the same time when they heard his words. Xuan Ziwen laughed and said, “Since everyone has a piece of the cake, then I won’t be so polite anymore. Count me in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Yuhao, keep the pills first. Let’s do it this way: everyone can go back and have a good rest and gather some strength so that we can take the pills together tomorrow and see how they affect us. Sanshi and I will check on the rest of the Tang Sect disciples and see how the medicinal aroma is affecting them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The conference was initially a little tense, but after Huo Yuhao’s clever suggestion, the mood became a lot more relaxed. Everyone was to try the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects, and even if someone didn’t get a pill in the end, at least they had tried it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone left to deal with their own matters. Bei Bei hugged Huo Yuhao across the shoulders and laughed as he said, “Nicely done, little junior brother. Did you know that I was really shocked when you said that there were only seven pills! We’ll be in trouble if this causes some infighting within the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled. “Eldest senior brother, I don’t think you have to worry about that. With the relationships that we have with each other, even if some of us don’t get the pill in the end, everyone won’t complain that much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei shook his head gently and said, “I don’t wish for anyone to have any negative feelings in their hearts. No matter what, your decision to divide it this way is great. Do you have something in mind?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “I feel like the Qiankun Fortune Pill’s effects might be stronger than I imagined. But I can only be sure what the exact extent is after experimenting. I hope that I can give the Sea God’s Pavilion one pill when I’m dividing them later. The Tang Sect wouldn’t be where it is today without the academy’s support.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded in approval. “That should be done. I was going to remind you if you didn’t mention it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Of the remaining pills, one will be given to Teacher Xiao Ya to treat her illness. There will be four remaining pills, and if the effects are good enough, I think two should be dissolved into water for everyone to use, and we will leave two more in the Tang Sect just in case.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei tilted his head slightly and said, “Yes, that’s good. I’ll rest assured if that’s your plan. Alright, you’ve been working so hard for so long, hurry up and get some rest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night passed peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Morning on the second day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various members of the Tang Sect’s inner circle gathered in their conference hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei had been here very early, and he said excitedly when everyone was gathered, “Yesterday, almost every single one of the Tang Sect’s disciples went into deep meditation after absorbing the Qiankun Fortune Pills’ medicinal aroma. Less than ten percent of them are awake at this moment.” With that, the smile on his face became even more radiant.</span></p>
