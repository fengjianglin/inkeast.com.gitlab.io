 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, even though he had become a Class 9 soul engineer, his understanding about soul tools was far deeper than before. He came to realize how important Huo Yuhao was as a prodigy, and that only Huo Yuhao could carry on his legacy and work towards breaking through and becoming a Class 10 soul engineer. Therefore, Xuan Ziwen had given some deep thought to this, and decided that he had to find some way to convince Huo Yuhao no matter what to properly learn about forging soul tools from him. Under such circumstances, he needed Huo Yuhao to remain. Otherwise, wouldn’t his intentions just be empty thoughts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen wouldn’t be surprised if Huo Yuhao couldn’t complete the decomposition cannon, but he didn’t want to see Huo Yuhao not have any solutions at all. From what he could see, if Huo Yuhao could at least immerse himself within those blueprints, he would definitely gain some understanding of them. That was enough for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a youngster who had just become a Class 7 soul engineer. What else could Xuan Ziwen expect from him, wanting Huo Yuhao to understand a Class 8 decomposition cannon, which had a complexity that came close to a Class 9 soul tool? As long as Xuan Ziwen could guide him, and with his continuously improving cultivation, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t need more than one or two years before he could become a Class 8 soul engineer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was very clear about Huo Yuhao’s talents. This fellow was just too talented. Not only was he intelligent, but he also had formidable spiritual power supporting him, and so had a much easier time forging soul tools than other soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the second day, Huo Yuhao still hadn’t moved or spoken, neither had he eaten or had anything to drink. He Caitou was starting to get worried, and he conveyed what he saw to Bei Bei. Bei Bei personally spoke with Xuan Ziwen, and wanted to interrupt Huo Yuhao so that he could stop, but Xuan Ziwen stopped him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen stopped Bei Bei irritably. From his perspective, Huo Yuhao was like a qualified soul engineer in his current state. He was more than eager for Huo Yuhao to continue being in such a state. “What? Stop? What kind of joke is this? Do you know how difficult it is for a soul engineer to be so immersed in his own studies? He can only truly experience the beauty of soul tools if he is frequently immersed in them and experiencing revelations from them; only then can he improve quickly. Not to mention two days, with that body of his he can spend half a month not eating or drinking without a problem. The deal has been struck, anyway; you guys will wait three days for him. If he doesn’t come to after three days, you guys can just leave without him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei couldn’t convince Xuan Ziwen, so he had no choice but to allow He Caitou to continue sending food and water to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Huo Yuhao paid no attention to any of that. His eyes didn’t shift away from those blueprints. He Caitou once observed Huo Yuhao closely for a little while, as he was afraid that Huo Yuhao was in a daze from scrutinizing those blueprints, but he quickly realized that Huo Yuhao was completely fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason was because Huo Yuhao’s expression was changing throughout the process. Sometimes he would frown, and sometimes he would express pleasant joy. There was a time when Huo Yuhao even slammed the table with his hand, startling He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was evident that Huo Yuhao was just immersed in his own research, and there was nothing wrong with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">--------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two days went by while Huo Yuhao was like that. The third day quickly arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei had already made all the necessary arrangements for the Tang Sect. Xian Lin’er and Qian Duoduo, their two Deans, had agreed to his request to take care of the Tang Sect, and they told Bei Bei to complete his task with assurance. However, Elder Xuan had also given them a time limit; everyone had to come back within one month, whether or not they could rescue Tang Ya. The Tang Sect needed them, after all, and the Tang Sect’s development was related to their resistance against the Sun Moon Empire in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The third day is coming, and little junior brother seems like he won’t be coming with us,” Bei Bei said to Xu Sanshi helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were about to depart the next day, so they made some final preparations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi pulled a long face and replied, “I wonder why teacher Xuan is so determined this time. I’m honestly not confident at all without little junior brother around! I didn’t feel that way last time, since he has always been the one planning strategies and whatnot. We’re about to go onto the battlefield by ourselves this time, and I am a little lost about where to start.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei couldn’t help but laugh. “Seems like we have to train a little. Otherwise, won’t we become laughingstocks?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi snapped, “Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Who will be the main control-type soul master without Yuhao? You, or me? Or who else? Not even sister Ziyan is going, and Ziyan can still be considered a half control-type soul master. Seems like Xiao Xiao has to take this role, but her control only works within a small area of effect, and when the battle is spread out over a larger area, she probably can’t keep everything under control. Bei Bei, why don’t we look for Teacher Xuan to convince him to let Yuhao go this time? He’ll learn properly when he gets back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei sighed and said, “I know how important little junior brother is. However, Teacher Xuan’s attitude is very resolute. You know that the Tang Sect couldn’t have developed so quickly in recent months and years without him, and we couldn’t have had so much support from the Academy. Teacher Xuan doesn’t typically ask anything of us, so I can’t reject his request this time, since he is so determined. Furthermore, he usually has a casual personality, but he’s very stubborn once he’s decided on something. I’ll only infuriate him if I look for him again. Forget it, let’s just work hard by ourselves. I don’t think we’ll have too much trouble rescuing Xiao Ya with Elder Song and Dean Yan around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I guess that’s all we can do,” Xu Sanshi replied in exasperation. “Alright, I’m going back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi stood up as he finished, when a voice suddenly erupted from outside. “Done, he’s done!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both Xu Sanshi and Bei Bei were momentarily stunned as He Caitou charged in from outside with an excited look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s done?” Xu Sanshi asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou said excitedly, “Little junior brother is done going through the blueprints, and he’s starting to forge the soul tool. He’s asked me to look for Teacher Xuan. I’m here to relay this good news before calling him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi shook his head helplessly and said, “Are you alright, second senior brother? Are you saying that he will succeed after he’s done going through the blueprints? Won’t that make becoming a Class 8 soul engineer too easy? You can go look for Teacher Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes! He might not succeed at forging the soul tool, even though he’s done with the blueprints,” He Caitou forced a laugh as he slapped his forehead. “I just watched little junior brother stare at blueprints for three days, and my thoughts went sideways that he would definitely succeed when I saw that he was finally getting down to crafting it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei smiled and said, “There’s nothing sideways about that. Little junior brother might actually succeed. Isn’t he very adept at creating miracles?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou nodded and said, “I also think there’s hope. Soul engineers have to understand a soul tool’s principles before forging it, and they have to figure out a soul tool’s blueprints that they’ve never seen before, just like he has. Little junior brother has been going through the plans for almost three days, and he’s finally getting to work. Perhaps he’s doing it because he’s out of time, or perhaps he has really understood them! I’m leaning towards the latter, as little junior brother never does things without thinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He will only have a chance at forging the soul tool if he understood those blueprints. Even if he isn’t yet a Soul Douluo, he has twin martial souls, so his soul power is stronger than most other soul masters at the same rank. Maybe he really can do it, and his spiritual power is just so formidable…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I’m going to look for Teacher Xuan, and you guys can go take a look if you’re interested. Let’s cheer little junior brother on together, and hope that he’ll succeed!” He Caitou ran out excitedly after his speech to notify Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi exchanged a look, and they uttered at almost the same time, “Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was done with the blueprints, but he didn’t start forging immediately. Instead, he drank some water, but didn’t eat anything as he sat down with his legs crossed while he began to meditate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had spent almost three days on these blueprints, and had consumed a lot of energy doing that. How could he craft a Class 8 soul tool without his energy in perfect condition? This was his first attempt!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was still meditating when Xuan Ziwen, Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, and He Caitou slipped into the silent room, and seemed to be deep in meditation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone besides Xuan Ziwen was a little stunned when they saw what he was doing. Xuan Ziwen nodded instead and said, “That’s good, he still knows that he should regain his energy before making this attempt. Seems like he’s very confident! Let’s wait and see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waiting around was typically very torturous. At least, that was the case for most people, but Huo Yuhao quickly gave them a reason to remove that torturous feeling, because something was happening to his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao only had faint soul power undulations before, but as time continued to pass, those undulations started to change. Furthermore, those changes were extremely weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faint gold colors began to emanate from inside his body. That was very normal for most people, as they would think that it was just his soul power visible externally. Most people could reach this state when they were without worries and didn’t need anyone to protect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao’s aura was just so dominating. A terrifying aura resembling that of an ancient awakening beast rippled out from his body as the faint golden light continued to flow out in waves. Everyone inside the silent room, including Xuajn Ziwen, began to felt a little stifled, and found it difficult to breathe.</span></p>
