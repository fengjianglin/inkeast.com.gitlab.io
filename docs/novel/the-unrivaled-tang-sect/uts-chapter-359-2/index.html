 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao wasn’t an indecisive person. He was able to become the Commander of Three Armies because he always performed his tasks quickly and effectively. After sensing Huo Yuhao’s immense spiritual power, he made his decision and ordered, “Let’s turn back to our base!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao heard his words, he heaved a sigh of relief, and quickly retracted the suppression that he had unleashed upon them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was in slightly low spirits because the Dragonscale Horses weren’t able to get up anytime soon. In the face of the Ice Empress’ hundred-thousand year aura, they needed at least two hours before they could get up. However, he couldn’t be bothered by this now. He had had no choice earlier! If he hadn’t asserted his authority, the White Tiger Duke wouldn’t have believed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger bodyguards were indeed elites. They didn’t need to be ordered before they started to retreat on foot. They turned towards the direction of their base, and started to run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They still maintained a strict formation. As they ran, they deliberately kept to two sides, leaving a pathway in the middle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without the suppression from Huo Yuhao, the White Tiger Colt became normal again. The White Tiger Duke quickly rode it back along the path that they had rode out on earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao was right not to use any flying-type soul tools. They would make him an obvious target in the air. Even if he were ten thousand meters away, the surveillance-type soul tools would be able to easily lock onto him. It was much easier for him to retreat on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyway, his enemies wouldn’t dare to remain in the air. The anti-air defense system in the Ming Dou Mountain Range wasn’t to be trifled with. It covered the entire aerial region within three thousand meters of the ground. The surveillance-type soul tools that Huo Yuhao had discovered earlier were close to five thousand meters in the air, and so weren’t discovered by the aerial surveillance soul tools!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragonscale Horse that Huo Yuhao was on couldn’t take it anymore either. He jumped off the back of the horse along with Wang Dong’er. In a second, Dai Hao had already ridden the White Tiger Colt over in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder, thanks for the warning. If we manage to avert this disaster, I’ll be eternally grateful to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao looked at the White Tiger Duke’s resolute expression that didn’t seem to reveal any sense of panic, Huo Yuhao felt his breathing quicken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, there wasn’t any hatred in his heart. It was just a genuine wish to help the White Tiger Duke escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s move quickly. Otherwise, it’ll be too late. Oh yes, is there any way of preventing your defensive-type soul tools from launching attacks against aerial objects? Or at least preventing them from attacking the aerial-type soul tools that we have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao stopped the White Tiger Colt and answered, “There is one way. As long as we mark the soul tools with a special symbol that belongs to our military, it is possible. I’m the only who can mark these soul tools; there’s a special way of distinguishing these markings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and asked, “That’s great. How far are you from nine rings?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao was stunned, and replied, “I obtained nine rings half a year ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Titled Douluo? He’s actually a Titled Douluo?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned at this moment. However, his heart turned cold following this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know Dai Hao was a Titled Douluo, but the enemies who were planning to ambush him definitely knew! An ambush on a Soul Douluo and an ambush on a Titled Douluo would naturally be different. This meant that their enemies were bound to be even stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t be bothered with anything else. He quickly retrieved something from his storage-type soul tool and gave it to Dai Hao. He said, “Quick, use it to cover you later. We’ll also help cover you. Quick, leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Dai Hao received the box that Huo Yuhao passed to him, he didn’t hesitate, and turned his colt around before it galloped away. He opened the box as his colt galloped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er were at the back now. However, Dai Huabin’s voice came from the side, “Let’s cover him together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he looked at Dai Huabin, Huo Yuhao was immediately furious. “Cover my ass. Quickly, go. If even he can’t deal with the enemy, what use do you think you are?” As Huo Yuhao spoke, he pointed at the White Tiger Duke, who was getting further and further away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin straightened his neck and said, “If you can stay behind to cover for them, why can’t I do the same?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wanted to slap him, which would help him get his revenge, too. However, Dai Huabin couldn’t die, as he was extremely important to both him and Wang Dong’er in their bid to pass the Deep Adventure round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop with the crap and let’s go.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao had already activated his soul thrusters to advance in the direction of the White Tiger Duke. Wang Dong’er didn’t unleash her martial soul, and just followed. Her martial soul was too obvious in the dark, she wouldn’t unleash it unless it was unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu chased the both of them. He was much more relieved. They had only left the base a little while ago. With his father’s speed, he would only take ten minutes to return!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the sky lit up at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Balls of greenish light started to fly towards them from the west. These greenish lights were shaped like gourds. As they were too far from the ground, their actual size couldn’t be determined. However, the sparks that they created in the sky were extremely blinding. The lights flew towards the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They are indeed here!,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sighed to himself. The enemy had surveillance-type soul tools in the sky, which was equivalent to having an extra eye in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the Sun Moon Empire was capable of sending surveillance-type soul tools five thousand meters into the air. At least, no other empire in the continent could do so yet. Most anti-air defense systems couldn’t accurately attack a target that was more than three thousand meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing Huo Yuhao could do about this, either. He was only a soul engineer between Class 6 and 7, and a five-ringed Soul King. Unless he could rise five thousand meters into the air to deal with the surveillance-type soul tools, he had no way to change the situation. Even though he knew they were being watched, he couldn’t destroy the surveillance-type soul tools. This was the result of his lack of power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew that he was doing pretty well so far. He had managed to stop the White Tiger Duke from advancing in a very short period of time. However, it was obvious that the enemy was well-prepared. After discovering that something was amiss, they had quickly launched a long-range attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, they could only see how effective the Star Luo Empire’s defenses were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky above the military bases of any empire was always a restricted zone. Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er once got into trouble when they were in the Heavenly Soul Empire. In the Ming Dou Mountain Range, the aerial restricted zones were even more strictly enforced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these greenish, gourd-shaped lights appeared, balls of red lights started to surge out from the mountain range towards them. They were aerial interception soul cannons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t very difficult to create such soul cannons. The key was that they were huge and exhausted a lot of rare metals. When in use, they also drained a lot of soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that the reaction of the Star Luo Empire’s anti-air defense system was pretty quick, Huo Yuhao also heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Very soon, the balls of red light clashed with the greenish, gourd-shaped lights. Just as both parties were about to clash, the greenish lights cracked. The front and back of the gourd-shaped lights separated. The front parts charged forward at a faster speed, colliding with the red lights, while the back parts stopped in mid-air.</span></p>

He expanded in size, and his short hair turned black and white, like a white tiger’s stripes. Two yellow, two purple and five black soul rings suddenly rose from him, turning into blinding light. His fourth soul ring shone extremely brightly, and balls of bright lights in the form of tiger heads quickly took form above his head. These balls of light generated dazzling, white sparks as they shot into the air.</span></p>

Furthermore, he managed to intercept the red lights accurately! The descending greenish lights had fallen extremely rapidly. Without Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, the White Tiger Duke couldn’t have accomplished such an impressive deed!</span></p>

This was not a soul skill, since it was able to hide from his Spiritual Detection and appear directly along the mountain pass. It had to be a soul tool!
