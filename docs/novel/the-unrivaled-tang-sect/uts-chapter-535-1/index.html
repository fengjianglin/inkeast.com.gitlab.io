 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eastern Sun City was a northern city. If it was like Radiant City, soul power detectors would sweep the city immediately. If that happened, the appearance of a large number of soul masters would still be easily detectable. In Eastern Sun City, it was evident that there wasn’t such a large-scale installation of surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The senior management of the Tang Sect were all gathered in the lobby. Huo Yuhao briefed Ji Juechen and Ye Guyi on his strategy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can command us.” Ji Juechen answered in the simplest of ways. With Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, he was always able to unleash his greatest fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little speechless as he avoided the passionate gaze in Ji Juechen’s eyes. He sighed helplessly. He knew exactly why Ji Juechen looked at him with such an expression. It was evident that he wanted to challenge him to a fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao exited his closed-door cultivation after two years, Ji Juechen was the most excited. It was just that Huo Yuhao went with Tang Wutong on a mission immediately, after which they were recruited for this fight, thus Ji Juechen didn’t have the time to challenge Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao was indeed a little fearful of such a look in Ji Juechen’s eyes. He was too crazy. Furthermore, over the past two years, Ji Juechen’s abilities had been continuously improving too. Even Huo Yuhao couldn’t discern what his current standard was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to note that Ji Juechen was the first among all of them to become a Soul Douluo. Although he was not yet a Titled Douluo, he was at least at Rank 88 or 89. More importantly, his abilities couldn’t just be measured using his cultivation. His terrifying sword intent was also very frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ji Juechen was close to becoming a Titled Douluo. Along with his powerful sword intent, Huo Yuhao had no confidence of defeating him, even though he had always been very confident in himself. The reason was very simple. Ji Juechen was simply too aggressive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s make a move then. Second senior, I’ll leave things here to you. Wait for my signal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou nodded at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, Huo Yuhao led Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Tang Wutong, Ji Juechen and Ye Guyi out of the hotel. He unleashed his Imitation and concealed the six of them in the darkness of the night. Not only this, but his Spiritual Detection was also shared with his teammates. He sent everything that he detected to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hotel was very close to the northern city gates. Very soon, Huo Yuhao and the others were close. They only stopped when they were around five hundred meters away from the soul formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul formation wasn’t very well-lit. It appeared a little dim, and things seemed to be very quiet inside. As some buildings were blocking it, it was unclear what soul tools were inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stood behind Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi, while Tang Wutong was behind Ye Guyi and Ji Juechen. Their Class 9 flying-type soul tools opened at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Through his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao said to the rest, “When I shout later, muster your soul power and protect yourselves, as the impact force from the high speed will be very great.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” The rest acknowledged his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao turned to look at Tang Wutong. Their minds were linked, and they both nodded. Their soul power poured into their flying-type soul tools at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, their Class 9 flying-type soul tools lit up at the same time. Blinding lights were released, such that they were no longer able to conceal themselves. This was especially so because of their soul power undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Charge!” Huo Yuhao shouted. He and Tang Wutong both grabbed onto one arm of each teammate by their side. They instantly burst forward, and the immense thrusting force made them seem like missiles. They charged in the direction of the soul formation like bolts of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as they fully unleashed their Class 9 soul tools, a deafening alarm sounded inside the soul formation. The soul power undulations from a Class 9 soul tool were simply too strong. The soul power detectors in the soul formation instantly detected their presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire soul formation lit up almost instantly. A gentle glow also shone from the linked defensive soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The worst thing that could happen to a soul formation was for enemies to assault it out of the blue. This was why the linked defensive soul tools were immediately activated once there the alarm sounded. The soul formation had to be protected before anything else was attended to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Class 9 soul tools were Class 9 soul tools! In an instant, Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong and the rest had already achieved supersonic speed. In just a flash, they covered five hundred meters, and instantly crashed their way into the soul formation. As a result, the linked defense only came up after they had charged their way in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t need to conceal them anymore. He unleashed his Spiritual Detection and engulfed the entire soul formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this soul formation with so many surveillance soul tools, his Imitation was effectively useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless soul rays were immediately fired, engulfing the six of them. The reaction speed was immensely quick. It was even faster than the soul formation at the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Clearly, the soul engineers here were well-equipped and highly experienced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had no time to be astonished. He unleashed his Spiritual Detection in all directions. It was as if he didn’t even see the countless soul rays that were being fired at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark gold light scattered, and turned into a metal barrier. This barrier isolated the soul rays. It was Xu Sanshi’s doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind Tang Wutong, her Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings opened. Suddenly, it was striking in the direction of the soul rays. As tremendous booms sounded, the soul rays stopped firing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that the entire soul formation lit up as bright as day. Huo Yuhao’s expression also changed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, his expression changed because he had received bad news from his Spiritual Detection. The first problem that he discovered was that this soul formation was much bigger than he had expected. Furthermore, the soul tools at the top and bottom of the city walls formed two different linked defensive formations. This also meant that the linked defensive formation at the top of the city walls was still effective against them, even though they had already snuck into the soul formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from this, Huo Yuhao also sensed two strong auras inside this soul formation. Those were auras that threatened them. They probably came from Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There are actually two Titled Douluo holding the fort in such an extremely northern city? They are certainly full of tricks!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao immediately understood why the Sun Moon Empire had such an arrangement here. Evidently, the threat posed by aquatic soul beasts was rather dire. This was why they needed someone strong to hold the fort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two Titled Douluo wasn’t considered too scary. The scary thing was that these two Titled Douluo were likely Class 9 soul engineers too. The strength of a soul formation was clearly different with two Class 9 soul engineers commandeering it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao was making such a judgment, he reacted immediately. On his forehead, his Eye of Destiny opened. Just as he spread his spiritual power without any conservation, he unleashed a strong strike of his Spiritual Blast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul engineers that were closer to the soul formation were instantly killed as their heads burst. At the same time, Ji Juechen, Ye Guyi, Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi also charged in different directions under the guidance of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power. They were all capable of fighting themselves. No matter how they were going to deal with the soul formation at the top of the city walls, they had to deal with things at the bottom first, since there were many more soul tools there. It was essential to suppress these soul tools before they dealt with the situation at the top of the city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the hotel, He Caitou was standing in front of a window on the third story. He was quietly observing the soul formation. Suddenly, his eyes brightened, and he shouted through his transmission soul tool, “Brothers, come with me.” As he spoke, he charged forward like a bomb. He broke the window and flew outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao, Jiang Nannan and the rest followed closely behind. Two hundred Tang Sect soul engineers also charged out of the hotel. They rose into the air under He Caitou’s leadership.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They formed a circular formation, and a linked defense was instantly formed under He Caitou’s orders. After this, every soul engineer lifted a high-explosive cannon to his shoulder and ferociously fired it in the direction of the northern city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This only happened because Huo Yuhao had just informed He Caitou through his Spiritual Detection to lead an all-out attack as a means of suppressing the soul formation at the top of the northern city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, Huo Yuhao and the others might be fatally hurt if they tried to fight their way up. Once they delayed and allowed more soul engineers to link up, their mission would become more and more difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they could suppress of the soul formation at the top of the city walls, the linked defensive formation would be quickly drained of soul power, and wouldn’t have enough strength to deal with Huo Yuhao and the others as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Adapting to changes on a battlefield was important no matter when. With regards to this point, Huo Yuhao undoubtedly performed very well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and the other three charged in four different directions. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t move at all. Huo Yuhao only grabbed Tang Wutong’s hand as he unleashed his immense spiritual power towards one direction in the soul formation. His terrifying might even caused the air to shake a little.</span></p>
