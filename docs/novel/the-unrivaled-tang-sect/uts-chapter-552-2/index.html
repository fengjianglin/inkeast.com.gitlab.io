 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion was the most powerful soul engineer legion among the three legions. It not only had the best equipment but also the strongest soul masters. They consisted only of soul masters with at least six rings. In fact, they were all direct disciples of the masters within Shrek Academy. They not only revered Huo Yuhao greatly, but also idolized him. Previously, Huo Yuhao had already led them to countless victories. Hence, none of them hesitated when he gave them the order to fly. All of them started to ascend into the sky as they followed the directions given by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After ascending into the sky, Huo Yuhao did not immediately evade the enemy’s attack. He merely gazed at the gigantic ball of light, which was formed from the white pillar of light that surged up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, the last few members of the Fort Soul Engineer Legion and the higher-ups of Tang Sect had entered the spectral gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Prepare to fire the guided cannon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single soul engineer within the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion lined themselves up as they placed a small yellow cannon on their shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take my position as the center. Fire at full power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao placed a similarly small cannon on his shoulder. However, his cannon was golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden beam of light that was blasted out of the cannon ascended only thirty meters before stopping in mid-air. A golden ball was formed rapidly at the tip of the golden beam of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, the white ball which was fired from Radiant City had reached its maximum height, and was starting to fall towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hundred streaks of yellow light were subsequently fired in the next two seconds. They were not aimed at the white light of light. Instead, all of them landed on the ball that Huo Yuhao had fired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up, and the strength of his spiritual power was raised to its maximum. At the very next instant, the cannon on his shoulder vibrated and released a powerful golden pillar of light that had a diameter of more than ten meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white light and the golden light seemed to instantly fuse in mid-air. While the golden beam seemed to pale in comparison to the gigantic ball of white light, it was somehow able to stop the ball in its tracks. Following which, a golden layer of light formed on the ball of white light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon seeing that, the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion cheered triumphantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao made a tossing action with his hand, and the ball of white light flew out far away as it headed back towards Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this was the power of the guided cannon—one of the linked offensive soul tools that the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion possessed. These powerful cannons were usually used to handle top-tier stationary soul cannon shells fired by their enemies. However, this time around, Huo Yuhao used it to counter the enemy’s linked offensive soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Guided cannon shells did not possess any offensive power on their own. Instead, it used the most gentle and flexible of ways to counter the soul power in the enemy’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only after the frightening ball of white light was sent towards Radiant City that Huo Yuhao was finally able to look at the damage beneath him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From high above, he was able to see the insane amount of destructive energy in the previous ball of white light that Radiant City had launched towards them. There was a huge crater which was over two hundred meters deep and a thousand meters wide. Everything was gone except for a small patch of ground that Tang Sect’s linked defensive barrier had protected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go!” Huo Yuhao waved his hand and brought the two hundred soul engineers along with him. At the same time, the eighteen spectral gates closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything had gone according to his plan. After ascending high into the sky with the rest of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, Huo Yuhao and everyone else was finally out of the attacking range of Radiant City’s soul tool deployment area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had chosen to retreat through the spectral gate earlier, he would most definitely not have been able to escape before the second ball of white light landed on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the biggest problem at Radiant City was that they didn’t have a strong soul engineer legion that could pursue Huo Yuhao and his team. Even though the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion was weaker than the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion, it was far superior to any normal soul engineer legion. In addition, most of their aerial surveillance soul tools had already been destroyed. Without any reconnaissance ability, they would not be able to go after Huo Yuhao and his team effectively. Hence, Huo Yuhao could convince Bei Bei to let him stay behind after mentioning how the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was not present. This was because the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion could only retreat safely if Huo Yuhao were to stay behind with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the frightening ball of white light headed back towards the Radiant City, Huo Yuhao believed that its power could definitely rival that of a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell. The soul tool deployment area within Radiant City was also definitely one of the strongest deployment areas he had ever seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this toy were to land within the city…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, another white pillar of light surged up into the sky in an inclined fashion. It shot towards the ball of white light that was heading for Radiant City. The ball was instantly hit by the white pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” A loud explosion could be heard from all the way up in the sky. Once again, the entire sky turned a bright white. This time around, Radiant City was illuminated by the explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a shame!” Huo Yuhao sighed as he shook his head. They were still not able to deal a greater blow to Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after this blow, they now had enough time to retreat. Without any aerial surveillance soul tools to lock onto them, the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion was able to retreat rapidly without any threat from the soul tool deployment areas within Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was still possible for them to be chased by high-level soul engineers. However, other than guiding the white ball away, the guided cannon shell would probably have deterred the stronger soul engineers from doing so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the enemy was a high-level Class 9 soul engineer, or even the Deathgod Douluo herself, he or she would have to consider if his or her own abilities were sufficient to deal with a powerful soul engineer legion which was able to use linked offensive soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held onto Tang Wutong as they increased their altitude. He had ordered their two hundred soul engineers to fly into the distance, while both of them would sweep behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao released his Spiritual Detection in all directions. He was keeping an eye on the situation in Radiant City. He wanted to make sure that no one was coming after them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that the frightening high altitude collision earlier had released powerful shockwaves. Even though the position of the explosion was not within the interior of Radiant City, the shockwaves had pretty much made it impossible for anyone to fly out of the city. Even if someone wanted to go after them, he or she would be deterred for safety reasons. In addition, all the aerial surveillance soul tools that had just ascended into the sky were also destroyed by the big explosion. There was essentially nothing left of them. It would be near impossible for them to monitor Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s movements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only now that Huo Yuhao finally heaved a sigh of relief. Following which, he held Tang Wutong’s hand as they chased after the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion ahead of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After flying close to fifty kilometers and making many deliberate turns to shake off any possible surveillance tools or troops that might be following them, Huo Yuhao led all of them into a small forest. Even though he was struggling with his spiritual fatigue, he repeated the incantations to open the spectral gate. However, because he was spiritually incapable of opening nine doors, he was only able to open three doors for them to enter with Li Ya’s help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, along with Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao, streamed into the spectral demiplane. Even though they did not lose a single person in this huge battle, all of them were in dire need of a rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bright colors above the Radiant City lasted for a good ten minutes before the sky started to darken again. However, the entire city had been consumed by mass hysteria.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though there were not many civilian casualties, everyone, regardless of their status, was awakened by the huge commotion above their homes. Even though they were no longer asleep, none of them dared to leave their homes. Most of them were just looking at the events which were unfolding from their windows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, they were able to see the numerous mystical sights which were happening in the sky above them. In addition, they heard plenty of frightening explosions. Most importantly, they witnessed a huge explosion in the direction of the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The closer a person stayed to the palace, the higher the status a person usually had. Even though the Palace did not allow any high-level structures near its compound, the explosion was still visible from a distance. The sight of the scary Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell ripping through the palace’s layers of defenses before striking the core area of the palace startled everyone who managed to catch a glimpse of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palace was not just any other place within Radiant City. It was the core of the entire Sun Moon Empire! Even though Xu Tianran had just ascended the throne not too long ago, he was able to bring enormous progress to the entire Empire as he conquered a large part of the Heavenly Soul Empire. In fact, his reputation was sky high after it was recently declared that the Heavenly Soul Empire had fallen into the hands of the Sun Moon Empire. He was already canonized as this generation’s holy leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his reputation would definitely take a huge hit due to what had just happened. In fact, no one knew whether their leader was even still alive. How could anyone sleep without knowing what was going on in the palace? It was bound to be a sleepless night for everyone within Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless alarms, explosive sounds and human voices could be heard everywhere within Radiant City. They were further worsened by the messy lights coming from different soul tools as fragments and shards fell from the sky. The world’s number one city had turned into a mess. The adverse impact that Huo Yuhao and his team had left on Radiant City far exceeded the actual destruction they had dealt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the palace within Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s face was as pale as death. Other than the rage and anger in his eyes, he pretty much resembled a dead man.</span></p>
