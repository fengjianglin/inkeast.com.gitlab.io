He couldn’t be so easily blocked by Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle was instantly crushed. Xu Sanshi was also flung back, spitting blood as he flew through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sanshi!” Jiang Nannan was screaming in pain as she was stuck in the Bony Claw Prison. She attacked the prison with all her might, but she still couldn’t escape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Xu Sanshi’s block also caused the Bone Dragon to stall a little. This gave He Caitou enough time to react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He unleashed his protective barrier and Invincible Barrier without any hesitation. At the same time, he also lifted two Class 6 soul cannons on his shoulders. He attacked with everything he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Yan Feng was too strong. In fact, his individual abilities were even superior to Tang Ya’s. It was just Tang Ya was very special to the Holy Ghost Church. That was why his status was slightly lower than hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou’s attacks didn’t have any effect on him. Although he was stalled momentarily, he crashed ferociously into He Caitou’s protective barrier in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bang!” He Caitou also flew back. However, he was quite fortunate compared to Xu Sanshi.</span></p>

His protective barrier was on the verge of breaking as he was also flung backward. It was important to know that his protective soul barrier was Class 7! If it were Class 6, he might even be in a worse state compared to Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Boom!” At this moment, a thunderous boom sounded in the sky, and the suppressed gloomy clouds seemed to be on the verge of erupting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re all dead!” The panting Lu Genggeng shouted in a furious and violent manner. He rose again, and charged towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

Yan Feng didn’t pursue Xu Sanshi, but instead unleashed his Dragon’s Breath towards the Eye of Fear in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This threat in the sky had to be removed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao gritted her teeth and did her best to restrain the Skeleton King. This was the most she could do. The Abomination and Bone Dragon were too strong. If she let the Skeleton King out, they were bound to lose!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan was trapped by the Bony Claw Prison and couldn’t move. On the other side, Xu Sanshi was critically hurt, and couldn’t get up after being thrown back. He Caitou was also frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only ones who could still fight were Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er. Their opponents were Lu Genggeng, who was like an injured wild beast, and Yan Feng, who was still in his Bone Dragon state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tang Sect has lost!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lu Genggeng roared into the sky. As he roared, fat started to ooze from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this fat wasn’t his own soul power, it was still energy that he had accumulated. It appeared very disgusting, but it was very important to him. He had obtained it through devouring corpses. Today’s setback was quite great for Lu Genggeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s chest flashed with light. He slid backward. It was the effect of a soul thruster on his chest. With the propulsion from his soul thruster, he advanced towards Wang Dong’er behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Feng fluttered his wings after getting rid of the Eye of Fear. The entire stage was in chaos. Yan Feng flew towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stage was only one hundred meters in diameter, and Yan Feng’s body was fifteen meters long. As he fluttered his wings, he quickly bore down on Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er in a suppressive manner. He also didn’t forget to unleash his Dragon’s Breath at Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as Xiao Xiao’s three cauldrons were overcome, Tang Dai could be released. The combination of the three evil soul masters would ensure their victory. Even though they were winning, Yan Feng still remained very calm. The mysterious Imperial Tutor nodded his head in approval as he saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They couldn’t be in a more dire situation. However, Huo Yuhao still remained very calm. His eyes had turned completely golden at this moment. Even his body was covered by a layer of golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the looks of it, he almost seemed to have been sculpted from gold right now. His wheelchair was also shining with the same golden glow. An awe-inspiring figure suddenly surfaced behind Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a tall man. As it was only a projection, the looks of this man couldn’t be clearly seen. He mimicked a smacking action, and an aura that resembled that of the Sovereign’s Descent was released, along with a streak of golden light. The Dragon’s Breath was intercepted by the streak of golden light, and both entities disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s vertical eye opened as he exploited this opportunity. Following this, the illusory figure behind him turned into a huge eye. It also had a vertical pupil, but it was silver.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whitesilver level of a body soul’s Second Awakening.” In the spectators’ stand, there were a few exclamations from different areas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden appearance of this Whitesilver vertical pupil shook all the soul masters who understood Body Souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was a Second Awakening of the Whitesilver level. This was one of Huo Yuhao’s trump cards. In the previous few rounds of the tournament, he had not used it no matter how tough he found things. It was only at this moment that he used it as they were on the verge of being eliminated. His teammates were in life-and-death situations, and he had no choice but to reveal his greatest trump card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of Huo Yuhao’s soul rings disappeared as a silvery-white light flashed. His body also slowly drifted up. He drifted into mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t walk, so only drifted there. But since he hung in midair, he currently didn’t appear any different from a normal person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The huge silver eye drifted forward and engulfed his body. At that instant, the golden light released by his Eye of Destiny fused with the silver eye. As gold and silver intersected, a distorted glow started to spread with his body at the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yan Feng saw the silver eye behind Huo Yuhao, he was shocked. One thought arose in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this the Second Awakening of his body soul? However, isn’t this something that only members of the Body Sect can do? Don’t tell me Huo Yuhao is a spy from the Body Sect in Shrek Academy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of all this, the light rays in front of him distorted. Yan Feng fluttered his wings and wanted to annihilate Huo Yuhao. However, his surroundings only rippled with distorted waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er had already stuck close to Huo Yuhao’s back, and now she wrapped her arms under his. She clasped her hands together in front of his chest. Her wings opened wide behind her back. Even she entered a miraculous state at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bone Dragon jerked and opened its wings. A thick icy-blue glow started to expand with his body at the center. He was trying to disperse the distorted lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the distorted rays instead became clearer and clearer.</span></p>

What did he do to Lu Genggeng?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Feng was shocked. He was very confident in Lu Genggeng’s defensive prowess. Lu Genggeng was only hurt even after being hit three times by two Class 7 soul tools. Could Huo Yuhao even hurt Lu Genggeng? It was unbelievable!</span></p>

Following this, Huo Yuhao’s body shone with bright white light. After this, he raised his left arm. His left hand opened wide, then mimicked a closing action.</span></p>

The back half of his body was blown apart. Suddenly, his fat scattered. At least a third of Lu Genggeng’s body had been blown away. His disgusting fat was scattered all over the arena. He was also flung into the air as he screamed, and he crashed down towards Yan Feng.</span></p>

The air on the stage distorted even more. This time, even the spectators couldn’t see things clearly.</span></p>

However, he hadn’t tricked anyone. It was because his left arm had just recovered a few days ago.</span></p>

He absorbed a little every day. In this way, his cultivation increased at a significant speed, and the origin energy of Ultimate Ice in his left arm greatly decreased.</span></p>
