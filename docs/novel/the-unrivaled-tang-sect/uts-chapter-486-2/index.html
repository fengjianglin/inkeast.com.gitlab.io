 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan smiled and asked, “What are you thanking me for? I already said that Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect are just like one family. Xiao Ya is the real sect leader of the Tang Sect. Shouldn’t we save her? However, do you have any way of removing the evil poison in her body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s expression turned slightly grim, and he answered, “It’ll be difficult. However, we have to save her before we even have a chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “Oh, that’s right. It’s fine for both of you to go this time, but please be careful. Think about who you want to bring along with you on this trip. You should be the ones holding the fort at the Tang Sect, but I’m afraid you’ll still be anxious even if you remain in the sect. That’s why it’s better for you to go. But you still need to arrange things in the Tang Sect first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I’ll do so!” Bei Bei replied excitedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Xuan, how’s Tang Wutong? She saved me. I’m planning to go take a look at her,” Huo Yuhao probed by asking Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan replied, “You can’t find her now. She’s in closed-door cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao was stunned as he looked at Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan said, “I don’t know what’s going on with her, either. She seems a little distracted after saving you. She asked permission from me to enter closed-door cultivation. No one is to disturb her. She’s very talented, and is not even inferior to you. I hope this round of cultivation will do her some good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">--------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Elder Xuan’s words, Huo Yuhao naturally couldn’t insist anymore. He returned to the Tang Sect after leaving the Sea God’s Pavilion with Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei immediately got busy. He didn’t know when they would return once they left on this trip. Things were still very busy in the Tang Sect. Naturally, he had to make plans before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t idle either. He returned to his room and immediately summoned the Snow Empress from his spiritual sea. The situation of the Ice Bear King was unknown, but he believed the Snow Empress had a way of finding him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slightly sighed and thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’m afraid the Snow Empress will scold me this time. I was really resigned to dying then. I really feel a little uncomfortable facing the Snow Empress, Ice Empress, and Brother Skydream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But I have no choice. No matter what, this issue has to be settled.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had no choice, he gritted his teeth and summoned the Snow Empress from his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure flashed before the Snow Empress appeared. Just like Huo Yuhao had expected, she was staring at him with a cold look. It looked like he was going to be in great trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was wrong.” Huo Yuhao lowered his head and used the same trick he had used on Elder Xuan earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress didn’t say anything as she looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Snow Empress, I admit my mistake. I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boo!” The Snow Empress suddenly laughed. She couldn’t maintain the cold expression on her face anymore, and a captivating smile surfaced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao subconsciously lifted his head. When he saw her laughing, he was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What, what are you laughing at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress suddenly turned serious and snorted, “What do you think? What do you think I’m laughing at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and replied, “I don’t know! I’d rather you scold me instead. I’ll feel better then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress snapped, “Daddy, are you so miserable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao got goosebumps when she called him ‘daddy’. “I think calling me that is even worse than scolding me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was furious, “I’ll keep calling you that. Daddy, daddy, daddy…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao listened to her listlessly, and didn’t dare to resist at all. Who asked him to be the one at fault?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The room became quiet once again. The Snow Empress looked at him just like that, but he didn’t dare to look back at her. He only lowered his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief moment, the Snow Empress laughed once again. “You’re indeed a fool. No wonder Wang Dong’er called you that when you were still together. Did you really think the Darkness Holy Dragon wanted to kill you? And that we’d watch and let you die? He didn’t have the intention of killing you from the beginning. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so simple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao lifted his head and looked at the Snow Empress in a daze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress snorted coldly. “Did you not understand me? That day, right from the start, the Darkness Holy Dragon had no intention of killing you. I don’t know what you were thinking. Given his cultivation, he would have countless ways to kill you. He can even avoid Di Tian. However, he didn’t have the intention. Didn’t you notice that? If he wanted to kill you, what would be the point of dragging you outside the city? The city is his territory. What would be the point of dragging you outside the city?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned as he asked, “He didn’t want to kill me? Why did he threaten me, then? And why did he lay his hands on me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress answered, “I didn’t understand at the start, either. I only felt that he neither wanted to kill you nor harbored any evil intentions toward Tang Wutong. Otherwise, do you really think you could have attacked so many times? If he didn’t give in to you, you would already have been restrained by his Domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. “That’s weird, then. If Long Xiaoyao didn’t want to hurt me or Wutong, what was the point of appearing? Snow Empress, tell me, quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said coldly, “Before I reveal his true intentions, let’s talk about us first. You wanted to abandon us, right? Tell me, what should we do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was helpless as he laughed bitterly, “I had no choice then! Did you really expect me to be confident in the face of an Ultimate Douluo? I had no choice. I only knew that Long Xiaoyao would keep his promise. The poison in his dagger could have killed Tang Wutong. I’d rather take the poison in her place. At least one of us would be alive to relay information. I’m a man. I couldn’t have let a woman take stabs for me! Furthermore, I remember the Ice Empress mentioning before that your origins have been consolidated after absorbing the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence. Even if I died, all of you could still find new bodies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress sighed and said, “You’re really a fool. Ice was only saying that. Furthermore, she was only speaking theoretically. Right now, let me tell you for real. In fact, our lives are tied to you. If you die, we die. Skydream might still be able to leave your body. However, have you forgotten? When you were forming your soul core, he left the remnants of his spiritual origin to you. It’s like allowing a part of his Spirit to fuse with you. He’s already a part of you. If you let him go, would you still have a conscience?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress snorted coldly and continued, saying, “Furthermore, can Ice leave? She’s your second martial soul, and her origin power is in your soul bone. If you die and she’s able to escape, she’ll have less than one percent of her original strength. She’ll dissipate before she can even find a new body. Among all of us, Star Anise is the most likely to escape. That’s because Star Anise is a pure Spirit. After absorbing some ice essence, its origin is stable, and is the only one who can find a new owner.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After speaking to there, the Snow Empress paused for a moment before continuing, “Lastly, me. Initially, your teacher burned the origin of his divine sense to save me, so that I could become your Spirit. Otherwise, how could you have handled my immense strength, given how weak you were back then? My origin has long been interlinked with your Spirit through your teacher’s divine sense. He saved me out of goodwill. However, he also tied me to you in order to save you. If you die, I’ll be the next. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was indeed Huo Yuhao’s first time learning about his connection with his four Spirits. He felt very guilty now. The Snow Empress’ words were very clear to him. If he died, all his Spirits, excluding the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass, would be buried with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, his face turned red. He didn’t know what to say. He had only achieved what he had today with the help of his Spirits. However, he had thought of giving up then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress groaned, “I’m telling you all this to make you understand. You aren’t living for one person now, but for everyone. Yes, you might have faced some obstacles in your love life. However, you’re a man. Can’t you live without love?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mm.” The Snow Empress gently acknowledged his words and said, “Alright, you don’t have to act like this. In fact, we aren’t angry with you.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The look in the Snow Empress’ eyes had evidently turned gentler. She sighed slightly and said, “We can understand what you’re going through, and it’s not easy. All these years, you’ve been cultivating tirelessly and facing all sorts of dangers. You’ve even been spiritually affected. To be honest, you’re already very tough and resilient for a human. If it were someone else the other day, he would have made the same choice too. This is why you shouldn’t think too much. We can understand your decision. You’re tired. The pressure on you has been too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me tell you something else. Remember that we are your Spirits. We are one with you. No matter what you do in the future, you must treasure yourself. It’s the same as treasuring us. Moreover, you don’t have to treat us as burdens or misgivings. We’re part of you. That’s why we should try to help you shoulder whatever burdens you have, instead of giving you more pressure.”</span></p>
