You’re being chased like a stray dog.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke was displeased as she said, “Hey! Don’t point out our mistake first thing after you arrive. Let me tell you, they’re falling for the trap. What’s this minor encirclement? These hundred thousand people are the main force of the enemy, and they have fallen into our bigger trap. Our people will arrive in less than an hour. When that time comes, they can only dream about escaping.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao snorted. “Do you think you can last for an hour and have the last laugh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi nodded and said, “It’s my fault. I underestimated the number of enemies. I also didn’t expect them to be so determined in their pursuit. They even sent a hundred soul engineers to deal with us. We’re in trouble now, and we’re getting worn down. Let’s leave quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With your abilities, you should be able to break free from the encirclement without any soul engineers pestering you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was observing Ju Zi all this while. He admitted that she was indeed ravishing. Her skin was especially tender. It was different from his skin; her skin seemed to have a layer of moisture on it. After hearing Ju Zi’s words, he said coldly, “If we wanted to leave, we wouldn’t have rushed in before the enemy set their trap.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dim light flashed. Huo Yuhao revealed an icy-cold light on his face. “Sister Ju Zi, tell me the classes of the soul engineers among the troops that are pursuing you. Appraise them according to the standards of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi also revealed her fearsomeness and capability as a soul engineering commander. She repressed her emotions and said, “They are all Class 4 soul engineers. Their leader should be a Class 5 soul engineer. Their soul tools are mainly Class 4, and there are less than five Class 5 soul tools. We destroyed a few earlier. The total should be around eighty now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for a moment, Huo Yuhao asked again, “Without the interference of these soul engineers, how long can your troops last?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Ju Zi could say anything, Ke Ke said, “Our soul power has been greatly depleted. On average, less than thirty percent of our soul power remains. We don’t have stationary soul tools to back us up either. Under such a circumstance, our troops can only survive for fifteen minutes even without the soul engineers’ interference.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “I understand. Ju Zi, continue to command your troops. Use the top of this mountain as a barrier to protect yourselves. From now on, we only have one strategy – hang on until the reinforcements arrive. Are you certain that there will be reinforcements?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Absolutely certain,” Ju Zi replied, “I devised this strategy. We have thirty thousand troops waiting in ambush. This small group of soul engineers is here to bait the enemy to venture deeper in. The enemy is still unaware that our reinforcements have arrived. I gave a signal earlier. In less than an hour, our troops will reach us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Good. Then let’s continue with your strategy. With the current condition that you’re in, it’ll be hard for you to fight your way out. You can only hold your ground to have any chance of escaping.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A young soul engineer to one side of Ju Zi was furious. “Hold our ground? How do we do that? Our soul power is almost depleted. There are soul engineers in the enemy’s camp that are targeting us. Even before our protective barriers fail, the enemy’s troops will reach us!” At this point, the enemy’s troops were already gathering towards this side rapidly. They would reach them in around fifteen minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Leave those soul engineers to us. Ke Ke, hand these out to everyone before the enemy comes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he continuously slapped his waist before performing a flinging action. Soul tools flew out of his waist and landed in the hands of the soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were all Class 4 Milk Bottles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After receiving a Milk Bottle, Ke Ke couldn’t help but ask, “Huo Yuhao, why do you have so many Milk Bottles with you? Are you becoming a nanny?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s face turned black. Ju Zi and Wang Dong couldn’t help but laugh even though the atmosphere was tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What nanny? Milk Bottles are the most valuable among all soul tools in the same class. When I’m free, I make some of them to exchange for some money. At the same time, I can use them. When you finish using them, you still have to pay me. The rent will be calculated separately. Wang Dong, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he pulled Wang Dong by the hand. He peered into the sky and roared, before bursting towards the enemy soul engineers that had just arrived and surrounded the bottom of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao.” Ju Zi called, but both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were already gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youth who had rebutted Huo Yuhao earlier said, “There are more than eighty soul engineers! Are they courting death?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ju Zi was instantly enraged, “Shut up! Courting death? Are you daring enough to do what they’re doing?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, she felt her blood boiling when Huo Yuhao grabbed Wang Dong’s hand and burst down the mountain slope using their flying-type soul tools to face the enemy’s soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why was Shrek Academy’s Ultimate Soldier Plan devised? The goal of the Ultimate Soldier Plan was to have a single individual that could change the outcome of a war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huo Yuhao was about to experience his first battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was always crucial to take down the leader first. Undoubtedly, the soul engineers were the core of the enemy’s troops. It was only by getting rid of these soul engineers that the enemy’s long-range threat could be eliminated. This would buy more time for the soul engineers at the top of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes were filled with determination. He wasn’t afraid just because they were outnumbered. Wang Dong wore a frighteningly calm look in his eyes. He was so calm that he even appeared a little cold. As the two of them flew forward, they were like two eagles. They instantly reached the enemy using their geographical advantage. The soul engineers were evidently unprepared, as they only unleashed their soul tools and were ready to attack at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A distorted ripple was released from Huo Yuhao’s forehead. He and Wang Dong had to end the fight quickly. His Spiritual Interference was activated at the very start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After his spiritual power was enhanced, his Spirit Eyes’ soul skills were also enhanced. Under the effect of the powerful Spiritual Interference, these soul engineers who on average had four or five soul rings and a weak soul power foundation started to see things. They unleashed their soul tools slower, and were unable to identify their targets clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll take the front, you’ll take the back.” Huo Yuhao’s figure flashed, and he moved in front of Wang Dong. Wang Dong grabbed hold of his waist. Their bodies were tightly pressed against each other, and the rapid circulation of Haodong Power was maintained. Wang Dong’s arms flashed with a golden light, which appeared like a golden belt around Huo Yuhao’s waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asserted his authority the moment he surfaced. He waved his right hand forward quickly, and his Darkgolden Terrorclaws expanded in the air. A dark-golden light that was almost six meters in length flashed through the air before dissipating. At least five soul engineers were cut into pieces instantly. Blood sprayed everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, an intense azure light shot out from Huo Yuhao’s body. Following that, the azure light started to expand outwards, and then flashed before retracting instantly. The corpses were all frozen into ice cubes, and the soul tool cannons that had fired towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were solidified as the Domain of Perpetual Ice was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Countless streaks of golden light shone from Huo Yuhao’s body. The Butterfly Goddess Slash was unleashed. With the help of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, each Butterfly Goddess Slash seemed to have eyes. They accurately struck the corpses that had become ice cubes, and newer, smaller ice cubes stained with blood flew in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lifted his left hand up high, and an icy-azure light flashed. Countless booms instantly echoed from all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anything that was ice or covered in ice was about to be detonated by the Ice Explosion Technique. Even though all of the corpses weren’t contacted by Huo Yuhao’s left hand, they still exploded. It was just that these explosive forces weren’t comparable to the explosions that Huo Yuhao caused directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t expect these series of ice explosions to cause enough damage. He performed this action so that both he and Wang Dong had an opportunity to get closer.</span></p>

He hugged him from the back tightly.</span></p>

However, a strong thrusting force propelled both of them forward before he could even react. It was Huo Yuhao’s soul thrusters.</span></p>

He could clearly see the gold in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. On his forehead, the Eye of Destiny opened. Wang Dong knew what Huo Yuhao was going to do.</span></p>

After Huo Yuhao modified it, the powerful thrusting force sent them straight into the bunch of soul engineers.</span></p>

His first soul skill, the Guillotine Wings, had become the Blade of Asura. As the soul thruster propelled them forward rapidly, his blade left corpses behind wherever it passed. Even soul tools were slashed and destroyed.</span></p>

A few close-combat soul engineers quickly rushed towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, trying their best to stop them. The rest of the soul engineers also retrieved their close-combat soul tools and readied themselves to attack.</span></p>

He wouldn’t make such a choice, either.</span></p>

If anything happened to them, she wouldn’t hesitate to rush over to help them. Even if that meant death, she was willing to die with Huo Yuhao. He had risked his life for her once again.</span></p>

Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao landed on the ground. At this point, there was a pitch-black hammer in his hand. It was his second martial soul, the Clear Sky Hammer.</span></p>

Everything around seemed to have disappeared. What remained was only an illusory figure. This figure looked very strange. It was transparent, but its appearance couldn’t be made out. It formed a heart shape with its hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time seemed to have stopped at this moment. The illusory figure that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had formed also experienced a change. Its eyes brightened.</span></p>

It was a pair of eyes that couldn’t be described with words. The bright gold within them seemed to have arisen after gathering the starlight in the sky. The strange golden glow caused the surrounding lights to dim as it appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange vertical eye slowly opened on that illusory figure’s forehead. Golden light shone in the dark space. A bright golden hammer subtly appeared out of thin air. It was shattered above the illusory figure and converted into countless smaller hammers. After that, these hammers also turned into golden lights. In the next instant, a golden halo spread out from the forehead of the illusory figure.</span></p>

However, web-like cracks started to appear in the air as the golden lights passed. Space itself seemed to be on the verge of collapse. The intersecting cracks quickly separated the soul engineers.</span></p>

The small hammer also mysteriously disappeared. However, the soul engineers that were ready to attack stood in place like statues. Whether they were Class 4 or Class 5 soul engineers, they weren’t moving.</span></p>

The heads of seven men had been blown apart! Their corpses collapsed to the ground instantly.</span></p>

The bloody lights expanded quickly, and the heads of the soul engineers that were still intact all started to blow apart, one by one. There were no exceptions.</span></p>
