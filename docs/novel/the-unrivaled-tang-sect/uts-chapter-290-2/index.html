It was because of Shrek! Elder Xuan had given them special permission to compete on behalf of their sect so that they could establish the Tang Sect. The duty of protecting Shrek’s glory had been passed on to the hands of Wang Qiu’er and the rest. If they met Shrek in the tournament, how were they going to deal with this conundrum? If they personally eliminated Shrek, they would forever feel guilty over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was only the round-robin stage, but they were already in the same group as Shrek Academy. This was the worst news they could possibly receive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan lowered her head. Her eyes were red as she said, “I drew the lot today. I didn’t expect to be so unlucky, too. I’m sorry, Yuhao. It’s all my fault.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief moment of shock, Huo Yuhao calmed down and revealed a reassuring smile on his face. He said, “Fourth senior, don’t put it this way. You’ve drawn a good lot for us! How is it disastrous? I believe it’s the best lot that we could’ve drawn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan was stunned for a moment before she laughed bitterly. “Yuhao, you don’t have to comfort me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and answered, “I’m not doing that. I really think so! Think about it. If we’re in the same group as Shrek, we can team up with them. According to the rules, we’ll never meet before the final. Isn’t that the best situation that we could desire?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was speechless. “Brother, did you hear us carefully? We’re also in the same group as Sun Moon. We’re even facing them first!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Just get rid of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The five simple words that he uttered left the other three in the room stunned. Jiang Nannan’s red eyes slowly revealed a determined look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er squinted and said, “That’s right. Let’s just get rid of them. We can even pave the path for Shrek. It’s best that we meet them first. Let’s destroy them!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi gave Huo Yuhao a thumbs-up and said, “You are awe-inspiring!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and didn’t say anything else. Yes! They could just destroy the Sun Moon team. Did they really have to be scared of them? They conceded defeat in the last round for a tactical reason, but this time, they had to fight. Since this was the case, then they should just give it their all. Why should the Tang Sect be afraid of the Sun Moon team?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third senior, I’ll have to trouble you to call everyone here. We’ll be competing tomorrow, so we need to discuss our strategy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Xu Sanshi turned around without hesitation and left. In a short span of time, he managed to gather He Caitou, Xiao Xiao, and Na Na, and even Nan Qiuqiu, Ji Juechen, and Jing Ziyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Huo Yuhao’s room had been upsized. It wasn’t that packed anymore, even with everyone there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wore a serious expression and said, “We’ll be facing a strong opponent tomorrow, thus I’ll need to form our strategy today. We must win this fight and try our best to bring them down so that Shrek’s team has a chance against them. First, I hope no one tells eldest senior that we are facing the Sun Moon team. I don’t want him to worry and let him focus on recovering. With his current condition, he can only fight when we reach the quarterfinal. If he worries too much, I’m afraid it might affect his condition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone nodded as they agreed with Huo Yuhao’s opinion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao continued, “We have only one goal in the individual elimination round: weaken the abilities of our opponents! For Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect, let’s not hold back anymore. However, we must also watch our own safety. We only have seven of us left; not even one substitute. Once we lose a member, we’ll find it difficult against them in the later stages even if we win the first fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu pursed her lips and said, “If only I could compete.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao snapped, “There’s no point in saying that now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Nan Qiuqiu was angry the moment she saw him. Even though she had joined the Tang Sect to avoid being punished by her mother, she didn’t have a good impression of Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t bother with her and said, “The team round will decide which team will eventually win. However, it’s very important for us to weaken our opponents in the individual elimination round.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We need to arrange the order in which we compete carefully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll go first!” Jiang Nannan said decisively. She was the one who had drawn the lot, and thus she blamed herself for it. She had even berated Xu Sanshi in the last round. Right now, she felt extremely guilt-stricken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, Sister Nannan. Have you forgotten what I said? If we fight the Sun Moon team, I’ll be the one to go first,” Wang Dong’er said without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan furrowed her brow and retorted, “Dong’er, this is not the time to be emotional. Your cultivation is higher, so you should among the last few to compete. If you compete first, your energy and power will be greatly depleted. When it comes to the team round, we’ll still need to rely on your martial soul fusion skills with Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er replied, “Fourth senior, listen to me. Choosing to compete first isn’t an emotional decision. Xiao and Meng Hongchen are undoubtedly the core of the Sun Moon team. In my opinion, Meng Hongchen’s venom is more difficult to deal with, even though Xiao Hongchen’s abilities are greater. The venom from her Vermilion Clear Icetoad can greatly deplete one’s soul power. Once you are unable to unleash any soul power, you’ll be knocked out. Senior Dai Yueheng lost to her back then even though he was so strong. Once Meng Hongchen enters the stage, which one of you are confident of beating her? Only Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice can curb her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, Huo Yuhao is our main control soul master. Furthermore, he can’t over-exert his body because of his physical condition. He’s also the one we need to achieve victory in the team round. Considering all this, no one is more suitable than me to fight her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu was curious. “Why is that so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er smiled and said, “It’s because my Fire of Light can curb her venom. At the same time, it’s also because of some special feelings that she has for me. I’m not trying to exploit her feelings, but at least I know she won’t try to kill me. This can tip the balance in my favor. At the same time, Yuhao can discover her weaknesses even if I lose through his control and detection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu opened her eyes wide and said, “She-she likes you? She’s really shameless...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi slapped his forehead and shouted, “Qiuqiu! Your logic is really good. She’s shameless because she likes Wang Dong? Don’t you like him too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu’s face turned red, and she turned around, refusing to reply to Xu Sanshi. Although she was quite willful, she was a very straightforward person, and said anything she wanted to. Over the past few days, she had slowly integrated into the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew that it was time for him to express his opinion. He understood Wang Dong’er very well. He knew that she had said all that to compete first and handle more of the pressure. Who could be sure that Meng Hongchen would be the first to compete from the Sun Moon team? What if she wasn’t the first? Wang Dong’er would still have to face her opponent, and her opponent might even be Xiao Hongchen!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both parties were arch-enemies. They couldn’t be surprised by any tactics that the Sun Moon team used.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, Dong’er will be the first to compete then.” Huo Yuhao made his decision. Even though he was gripping the handle of his wheelchair tightly at this point, he still made this difficult decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were a single entity. He couldn’t leave her behind to fight just because of their relationship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, eldest senior has instructed me to command the entire team in this tournament. Whether it’s Dong’er or anyone else, all of you must listen to my instructions. Whoever I choose to compete will compete, and whoever I choose to remain on the bench will remain on the bench. This is so that we can eventually achieve victory. Whoever doesn’t listen to my instructions will not compete anymore. Seniors, Dong’er ,and Na Na, I hope all of you understand where I’m coming from. There can only be one voice during the tournament.”</span></p>

His eyes were filled with a look of determination. Even He Caitou and Xu Sanshi, who were both the oldest, were stunned when they saw the look in his eyes. Right now, they were impressed by his aura.</span></p>

He said, “I agree. There can only be one voice during the tournament. I believe Yuhao will be able to lead us to victory.”</span></p>

She knew that Huo Yuhao would do something crazy if something happened to her because she was being stubborn. He had landed in this state because of her. How could she bear to see him hurt because of her again?</span></p>
