 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a lot weaker than the Princess of the Sea when it came to soul power and cultivation. This was further exacerbated by the fact that they were competing in the sea. The only possible way he could compete with her was through his spiritual power. Hence, he could only watch the blue ripples envelope his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately, Huo Yuhao’s forehead emanated a rose gold light. He should be feeling fortunate that the Princess of the Sea had once again chosen to launch a spiritual attack at him. After all, the Merfolk were best known for their spiritual abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, Huo Yuhao’s Three-Eyed Golden Lion Skull of Destiny provided him immunity from the second spiritual attack of the day. It was able to block the Princess of the Sea’s attack, and bought Huo Yuhao precious time to act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights started to sparkle in his Eye of Destiny as all three of Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned golden. While the Princess of the Sea’s attack enveloped his body, he would escape unscathed and surprise the Princess with his attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three streaks of pure golden light were projected from his body into the seawater. In the blink of an eye, the light had already sped past all three hundred meters of seawater and landed on the Princess of the Sea’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Shock! It was a spiritual shock released when he was in his three-eyes state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the three golden streaks landed on her body, the gigantic eye behind Huo Yuhao’s back flickered with a golden light before disappearing. In the next instant, it had silently reappeared behind the Princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea instantly tossed her daughter out of the way as her body immediately turned a rose gold color—the same color as the gigantic eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Asura Three-Eyed Godsealing Spell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an extremely powerful ability the Huo Yuhao had developed in the moment of inspiration when his Body Soul awakened for the second time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not a soul skill but a combination of his soul skills, spiritual power, soul power, and the power of destiny from the Eye of Destiny that the Three-Eyed Golden Lion had given him. It was an entirely self-created soul skill which combined all of the above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Princess of the Sea was incredibly powerful, she was unable to break free from the seal of the Asura Three-Eyed Godsealing Spell. She could only rely on her spiritual power to defend herself from the impact of this powerful soul skill, and was unable to release any sort of power into her surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was instantly freed from his shackles. Without hesitating, he turned around and slammed into the ice ball behind him with his left palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ice ball exploded as a path suddenly appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And a purple golden light—Tang Wutong—emerged from the ice ball.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grabbed Tang Wutong’s hand as both of them made a dash for the surface. Even though they were in the sea, Huo Yuhao activated the Class 9 flying soul tool behind his back as it accelerated their ascent to an incredibly fast speed, similar to the blade-shaped fish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, a piercing scream echoed into Huo Yuhao’s brain. Huo Yuhao’s stare immediately turned cold as he looked behind him. The mermaid with the silver crown was chasing after them. Huo Yuhao’s eyes immediately revealed his burning desire to kill her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the greater part of their journey, they had not threatened the lives of any aquatic soul beasts. In fact, they were the ones who had been threatened constantly. In the end, even the Princess of the Sea had decided to take action against them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Princess of the Sea was temporarily sealed, her daughter still persistently chased after them as she tried to stop them from escaping. This made Huo Yuhao terribly angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really think I don’t dare to kill you?” Huo Yuhao’s body immediately radiated a powerful murderous intent. At this instant, the Haodong Power between him and Tang Wutong had already been established.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao raised his right hand and released a Darkgolden Terrorclaw towards the mermaid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly, a gigantic claw appeared at a distance of a hundred meters from him. The claw was able to shatter all the surrounding seawater with its sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the mermaid was still a fair distance away, she could sense the sharpness and power of the claw. Her face immediately turned pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the Merfolk were known for their spiritual gifts, they did not possess particularly outstanding defensive abilities. Even though she was a mermaid with close to a hundred thousand years of cultivation, her close-combat ability was relatively weak. Hence, she was captured by Huo Yuhao fairly easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, as the claw came towards her in a suppressive manner, the mermaid had no choice but to slow down as she controlled the surrounding seawater to improve her defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao made good use of this opportunity to continue accelerating with Tang Wutong. However, the claw did not collide with the mermaid head-on. It merely swept horizontally before hitting her as it blocked her path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid was surprised that her defense was not challenged by the claw. Just when she was about to continue to chase after them, she realized that the Darkgolden Terrorclaw was able to turn itself around in the seawater and follow her. It was able to follow her in a peculiar fashion wherever she tried to move as it attempted to block her from pursuing Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time that the mermaid had encountered a soul skill which was “alive” even after being released.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, she did not know that this was a result of Huo Yuhao having attained a high level of spiritual power. His spiritual power had already been given material form. When he launched the Darkgolden Terrorclaw, he had injected a sliver of spiritual power into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid merely had to increase her speed and go around the claw to escape from it. Huo Yuhao’s claw would not have been able to keep up with her. After all, there was only so much control the sliver of spiritual power could grant. Nonetheless, the claw which had seemed to be “alive” had mentally overwhelmed the mermaid to the extent that she did not attempt to try and beat it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong continued their ascent as they neared the surface of the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whoosh! Whoosh!” Two loud splashing sounds could be heard as both of them emerged from the sea and flew straight up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong hugged Huo Yuhao the moment they managed to get back into the sky</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao was incredibly pale. After leaving the high-pressure environment within the deep sea, his mouth and nose were bleeding. His entire aura had become a lot weaker.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, are you okay?” Tang Wutong asked frantically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao waved his hand as he attempted to reassure her that he was fine. “I’m fine. It’s just that I expended too much spiritual power in a short amount of time. Don’t worry about me. We better leave quickly. I don’t think my seal can hold the Princess of the Sea much longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Huo Yuhao create the Asura Three-Eyed Godsealing Spell and escape a life-threatening situation without paying the price for it? In fact, it had taken a lot out of him for him to achieve both of those things. He was almost out of spiritual power now. The only reason why he was able to continue his ascent was that he simply had incredibly strong and powerful spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong held Huo Yuhao in her embrace as she increased the speed of their flight. Huo Yuhao breathed heavily as he tried to suppress the dizziness in his head that was trying to overwhelm him. Afterwards, he mustered his soul power and changed his martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Spirit Eyes were instantly replaced with an aura of Ultimate Ice. At the same time, he summoned the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was able to sense what had happened outside—especially after the huge commotion in his spiritual sea. A few of his spirits had already been awakened by what had happened. Huo Yuhao might have released them just now if he was able to free up some time during the battle to do just that. However, the pressure exerted on him was simply too much for him to do anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Snow Empress left his body, her expression also showed her disbelief at what had just happened. She had not expected the usually gentle and welcoming Princess of the Sea to be so inhuman and ruthless in the way she responded to Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After summoning the Snow Empress, Huo Yuhao closed his eyes as he allowed himself to fall unconscious. The Snow Empress turned to Tang Wutong before nodding. “Wutong, he has only fainted because of the huge amount of spiritual energy he has used. From now on, I will control his body and cooperate with you. Yuhao’s seal can only hold the Princess for a short while. There will most likely be a battle after it fails. It would be best if I can persuade the Princess to let us go. If not, we can only do our best to keep ourselves alive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded as she revealed an equally cold stare. “I will do my best to work with you, Snow Empress.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing her sentence, the Snow Empress fused back into Huo Yuhao’s body and assumed control of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a logical decision by Huo Yuhao to select the Snow Empress to assume control of his body, because she was the spirit with the strongest spiritual power. The Snow Empress immediately drew upon his soul power to lift his right hand. The ring on his right hand lit up as crystal clear armor appeared in mid-air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This set of armor was deep blue. However, its color was very different from the sea’s dark blue color. It was not only full of life, but also seemed to possess a primordial aura. When it appeared, it seemed to cause the surrounding temperature to plunge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress lifted her left hand and tapped gently on the armor. Instantly, the armor disassembled itself into over ten different streaks of light that fused into Huo Yuhao's body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a full suit of armor that was composed of several plates that resembled slabs of dark blue crystal. Every single plate was carved exquisitely as they fit perfectly with Huo Yuhao's body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After donning the armor, Huo Yuhao's body seemed to have become considerably larger. Every single plate reflected the light from its surroundings. From afar, Huo Yuhao looked like a human-shaped sapphire gem as he radiated a warm blue glow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress controlled Huo Yuhao's body as she helped him put on the helmet. At this instant, Huo Yuhao's body seemed to be radiating an intensely cold aura. Even Tang Wutong could not help but use her soul power to insulate her body from the cold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress let go of Tang Wutong's hand. After all, she was not able to use Huo Yuhao's body to perform any martial soul fusion skills and use the Haodong Power with Tang Wutong. Ultimately, she was not Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after putting on this armor, the aura that Huo Yuhao was releasing had already surpassed Tang Wutong. This meant that his aura was already more powerful than that of a Titled Douluo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao opened his eyes, one could notice how his eyes were entirely blue. Those were the Snow Empress's eyes. The aura he was releasing continued to intensify as it steadily became stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this was the armor that Huo Yuhao and Xuan Ziwen had painstakingly researched and developed over the past two years. Xuan Ziwen had claimed that this was an irreplicable super human-shaped soul tool—the Icy War God's Armor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire armor was built from the Divine Ice Crystals that Huo Yuhao had brought back the other time. There were two sets of armor. One of them was the normal version, and the other one was the one Huo Yuhao was wearing right now.</span></p>
