 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

His Spiritual Detection could predict his opponent’s moves, but he couldn’t predict what their soul skills were. Both he and Wang Qiu’er didn’t have a sufficient understanding of these three wolf-apes. He didn’t expect these wolf-apes to be able to unleash a skill like Instant Teleportation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t hesitate as he pressed his toes against the ground before flipping his body over in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, the two wolf-apes didn’t just avoid his Empress Sword with their Instant Teleportation. They even landed behind him and started to encircle Wang Qiu’er along with the other wolf-ape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, it was three wolf-apes against Wang Qiu’er!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er had stabbed the middle wolf-ape with her spear earlier, but it was too quick. It had retreated instantly, and widened its gap with the Golden Dragon Spear. At the same time, its body swayed, and two illusory doubles of it formed. This soul skill reminded Wang Qiu’er of Spectre Wolves. Undoubtedly, these few wolf-apes must have some kind of blood relation to Spectre Wolves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two spectres leapt forward and resisted Wang Qiu’er’s attack. She kept on swinging her spear, creating countless streaks of spear light. Perhaps she had been holding in her anger after her falling out with Huo Yuhao, but right now, she vented all her anger. The two spectral wolves that leapt towards her were torn to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the other two wolf-apes that had teleported behind her and the wolf-ape in front of her all leapt at her at the same time. They all released an intense, purplish-black glow from their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They first unleashed purplish-black projections that were roughly the same size as them. Three projections rushed out at the same time and burst towards Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er roared into the sky, and a golden dragon projection appeared. She started to combust like a small sun. It was her second soul skill, Dragon’s Strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As her figure spun around, she stabbed her spear into the ground, and her fourth soul ring lit up. Her dragon roars were even more spirited. The head of the projection started to expand and swallowed Wang Qiu’er. Following this, a frightening explosion occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Qiu’er’s fighting style was always so forceful. The tremendous explosion caused the three projections to be blown to pieces. Everything within a ten-meter radius was blown to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the three wolf-apes were too cunning. As the explosion happened, their bodies disappeared at the same time. They couldn’t withstand the explosive force of Wang Qiu’er’s fourth soul skill, the Golden Dragon’s Explosion. When they appeared again, they were divided once again. This time, they were encircling Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three wolf-apes combined into one entity, and purplish-black halos started to light up from their feet. The three purplish-black halos that lit up started to expand in size. When they combined together, Huo Yuhao was trapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Huo Yuhao felt that he was restrained by an immense strength. He tried to activate his soul power, but it stiffened up. An indescribable, terrifying wave of pressure dragged him down from the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the three wolf-apes had almost turned a transparent purplish-black. &nbsp;A formidable, purplish-black fog started to rise. The intersecting halos shone brightly and trapped Huo Yuhao firmly within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t good!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this the legendary three-way martial soul fusion skill?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two types of martial soul fusion skills. The first type was formed when many soul masters exhibited their compatible martial souls at the same time. While this kind of soul skill could be considered a martial soul fusion skill, they were enhanced only because the soul masters complemented one another. Real martial soul fusion skills were like Huo Yuhao with Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er. Their martial souls fused within their bodies, generating huge strength and causing transformations. This kind of transformation usually only occurred with two people at one time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy had a record of a three-way martial soul fusion skill. It was formed by the Golden Iron Triangle, which consisted of Liu Erlong, the Grandmaster and the Four-Eyed Eaglecat Flounders; Shrek Academy’s founder. It was called the Golden Holy Dragon’s Call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That wasn’t a Golden Dragon, but a Golden Holy Dragon, which was light-type. It was different from Wang Qiu’er, who was pure strength-type. It could be considered an enhancement of the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon. The Grandmaster had been a descendant of the Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon. Due to their three-way martial soul fusion skill, they were called the Golden Iron Triangle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there had been no further occurrences of a three-way martial soul fusion skills in Shrek Academy’s history apart from the three of them. This showed how difficult it was for such an occurrence and to achieve compatibility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, this legendary ability was used by these three soul beasts. Furthermore, they used this martial soul fusion skill very aptly and trapped Huo Yuhao, who was completely unprepared for this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Huo Yuhao only felt that it was very difficult to breathe. The immense pressure completely suppressed his spiritual and soul power. Even the Eye of Destiny was suppressed until it couldn’t open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the three of them combined into one entity, their powers increased exponentially! As a dark purplish radiance rose from the ground, Huo Yuhao felt that his body was about to dissolve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only shocked one. Wang Qiu’er was equally stunned. She was as unfamiliar with these three wolf-apes as he was. Seeing that Huo Yuhao was in danger, she didn’t hesitate as she threw her Golden Dragon Spear out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst a piercing whizz, the spear carried the golden dragon projection and tore through space before landing on one wolf-ape’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that wolf-ape only glanced at Wang Qiu’er. There was a scornful look in its eyes. Yes, it was a scornful look!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The spear rebounded as if it had struck an indestructible wall. It didn’t cause any harm to the wolf-ape, while the dark purplish radiance had already risen from the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” Wang Qiu’er shouted, and an unprecedented, intense golden light rose from her body. Her eyes turned blood-red as her sixth soul ring was activated. Golden Dragon’s Bloodlust!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, she was already shining like a small sun. No one could see her figure clearly anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ball of orange-gold light separated from Huo Yuhao’s body. It was the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wore a solemn expression on her face. As her figure flashed, she appeared behind Huo Yuhao. She rapidly grew larger and larger, and regained the original look of the Snow Empress. As she pointed one hand into the sky and one hand to the ground, an orange-gold glow started to expand. Huo Yuhao’s body was engulfed within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Snow Lady’s strength belonged to Huo Yuhao. She normally absorbed her strength from him. But there was an even greater strength suppressing him! Although she had given it her all already, it was only barely effective for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath. He knew that it was impossible for him to retreat this time. However, he wasn’t afraid at this point. With the Snow Lady’s help, he had managed to suppress the rising dark-purplish radiance. He was also able to exhibit some of his abilities at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He first unleashed the Ice Empress’ Armor. At this point, the Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques couldn’t be used, as the Snow Lady was giving her all to resist the three-way martial fusion soul skill. Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny opened. His damaged spiritual origin was mobilized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His terrifying spiritual power started to combine with his soul power at a rapid rate. The aura of the Sovereign’s Descent started to soar. He wanted to use his cultivation to resist the martial fusion soul skill with the Snow Empress’ help. He believed that Wang Qiu’er wouldn’t let these three wolf-apes off after they had used such a powerful skill if he could survive their attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao was determined to fight his way out of this, a golden projection suddenly appeared in front of him. Following this, this figure went into his arms. Their foreheads met, and he could smell her breath. A vigorous strength engulfed every part of his body.</span></p>

There was a huge image of a golden dragon head on his chest. His entire head was covered by a helmet, which also had the appearance of a dragon’s head. The dragon scales engulfed his body perfectly, absolutely no skin was exposed.</span></p>

The Snow Lady returned to his body immediately. Before Huo Yuhao could react, his new armor had already unleashed a layer of intense golden light as a defense. The suppressive force was resisted, and dragon roars didn’t just echo in the outside world; they also sounded repeatedly in Huo Yuhao’s head. He could clearly recall that he was looking at Wang Qiu’er’s eyes with their foreheads touching when the dragon scales engulfed his body.</span></p>

It was the purest and most primitive type of gold that could illuminate the depths of everyone’s heart.</span></p>
