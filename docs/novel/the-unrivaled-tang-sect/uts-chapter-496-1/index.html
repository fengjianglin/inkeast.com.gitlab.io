 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t that right? Yan Shaozhe’s martial soul was a Radiant Phoenix, and all his abilities were based on the element of light, while the demiplane was inhabited by undead creatures. Yan Shaozhe and Ye Guyi definitely felt the most uncomfortable. If Ye Guyi hadn’t already tried and realized that killing these undead creatures didn’t improve her cultivation, she would probably have charged around to slaughter some undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe directly admitted it, and said, “Yes! I truly don’t like the feeling of this place. Yuhao, you have to tell me how you got this demiplane when we go back. I believe not even an Ultimate Douluo can possibly possess a place like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. One of my teachers left this place for me,” Huo Yuhao needed to keep this secret very strictly before, but as he became stronger, he didn’t need to be so stringent. After all, he required this ability more frequently now, just as he had told Elder Xuan without hesitation back then about how he had a Necromancer martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retreated from the black door, and began to chant, closing the spectral gate. Everything within the tent returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s plan wasn’t complicated. He was to go undercover in the Sun Moon Empire’s army camp, his next step being to find some way to locate where Tang Ya was staying. Then, he would attempt to get closer to her, and figure out what was happening there. Afterwards, he would find a suitable opportunity to make a move and rescue her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already planned how he was going to escape. He would have no choice but to draw upon his abilities as a necromancer when that happened. They only had a chance to escape if he could create sufficient chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and the others had already conveyed their plans to the Heavenly Soul Empire before they departed. The Heavenly Soul Empire would feint an attack right before Huo Yuhao and the others would make their move, but a feint attack would be all. The attack was meant to attract their enemies’ attention so that they could maneuver and complete their mission better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire was very supportive of their plan, and that was especially true after finding out that Elder Song had defeated and killed an evil Titled Douluo. Huo Yuhao had also promised that he would try his best to disrupt and destroy things within the Sun Moon Empire’s camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was the only successful product from the Ultimate Soldier Plan, and he was best at concealing himself, assassinations, and carrying out covert missions. Creating some trouble inside the Sun Moon Empire’s camp wouldn’t be difficult at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He began to contemplate his plan as he sat down with his legs crossed, and he tried all he could to make sure that his plan was complete. His strength would be very inadequate if he was by himself, but he had a very good helper now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">----------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky was becoming brighter outside, and the break of dawn meant a new day was about to begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao exited the tent and stared at the blue skies as he gazed far into the east, quietly absorbing the thread of purple energy that rose there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long before Nangong Wan walked briskly towards him. Their eyes met for a moment, and Nangong Wan smiled as he walked over and said, “Up so early, Masquerade? Come, let’s go grab something to eat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan didn’t rest the previous night either. He was even more worried than Huo Yuhao that Yuhao’s identity would be revealed, because he would be in deep trouble if the false identity was discovered. When that happened, life and death wasn’t the problem, because he would rather die than be alive. Nangong Wan was all too aware of the Holy Ghost Church’s methods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao didn’t waste words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They proceeded towards the canteen under Nangong Wan’s guidance. Nangong Wan projected his voice with his mind as they walked, and he introduced the places they walked by.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan was very useful as a spy, because Huo Yuhao couldn’t use Spiritual Detection to investigate the camp directly. They were inside the army camp’s core section, and there were many powerful evil soul masters wherever they went. They were heading towards where the soul engineer legions were camped, and it was imperative for Huo Yuhao to know where they ate, where they showered, where they typically exercised or moved around in the day, and which areas were forbidden or the most dangerous. He could only make sure that his plan was complete with sufficient intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Holy Lady typically has her breakfast very early in the day, and it should be about now. We should go see her.” Nangong Wan passed a message to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered with his mind without altering his expression. “Avoid interacting with other people to keep from exposing us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan replied, “That won’t be much of a problem. Us evil soul masters have our own personalities, and I’m better with people, so I’m more acquainted and friendly with many evil soul masters. But you don’t interact much with them, so even if you don’t say a word, they won’t say anything to you even if you run into them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They arrived in front of an enormous tent as they finished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Typical soldiers and even officers got their meals from the army cooks before they went back to have them in their own mess. Only high-level army officials had their own canteen spots, while evil soul masters naturally had better treatment. The soul engineer legions and high-level army officials were also unwilling to eat with evil soul masters, so even though their canteen wasn’t big, it was almost exclusively for evil soul masters to eat in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some evil soul masters who were here to eat even though it was still early. They bowed respectfully when they saw Huo Yuhao and Nangong Wan. Status differences were very clear within an organization like the Holy Ghost Church, and strength was status. If those who were weaker dared to offend those who were stronger, nobody would speak out for the perpetrator, even if he was killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were more than ten tables in the dining tent, and each table could seat about six people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body quivered once he entered the tent, and his eyes were almost guided by his consciousness as he immediately saw Tang Ya, who was eating at the innermost table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya was wearing a long black dress, with bright blue flowery patterns on the edges. This clearly showed that her status was different from the others, since most individuals in the Holy Ghost Church only had a pure black cloak. Elders like Nangong Wan and the Masquerade Douluo had silver patterns at the edges of their robes, and Nangong Wan had told Huo Yuhao that people from the Worship Hall had golden patterns. The Supreme Leader that Huo Yuhao had seen before had golden patterns all over his robe, and it had appeared most luxurious and attractive. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Nangong Wan exchanged a look, and Nangong Wan took him all the way inside until they were in front of Tang Ya’s table as Nangong Wan said respectfully, “Holy Lady.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya looked up at them as she nodded with a plain look in her eyes. She didn’t say anything, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s emotions rippled faintly when he saw her eyes. Tang Ya’s eyes were extremely cold, as if there weren’t any emotions in them at all, and her pupils were completely gray. Huo Yuhao couldn’t detect any kind of life from her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had interrogated the Delicate Silk Immortal about Tang Ya’s situation before. You You had told him that Tang Ya was under an evil spell, and she was badly poisoned. Her Delicate Silk Immortal Pill could dispel the toxins in Tang Ya’s body. At least, her pill could gradually remove and suppress those toxins. However, she still needed the Bluesilver Emperor to awaken her martial soul’s life energy. Otherwise, her life energy would flow away together with those evil toxins, and she would ultimately die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dishes in front of Tang Ya were very simple, but they looked very exquisite. There were evil soul masters at the other tables, but not a single one dared to sit at her table, as if this table was exclusively prepared for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan and Huo Yuhao walked to another table and sat down as they got their breakfast. Breakfast was very sumptuous, and was prepared with ingredients that were very nutritious and beneficial for evil soul masters. Only evil soul masters had such special treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao ate as he quietly felt the changes in Tang Ya’s aura. Her aura was undulating very weakly, as if her entire being no longer had any life energy. However, Huo Yuhao could feel an intense sense of alarm from her as she sat there, as if there was an enormous beast hidden within her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could feel his heart tie up into knots as he ate his breakfast in silence. He could still remember when he first met teacher Xiao Ya, and how lively and cheerful she was. She was with his eldest senior brother back then, and they were like a couple made in heaven! She made the decision and allowed him to join the Tang Sect, and then she used the Tang Sect’s only spot to let him enter Shrek Academy. It could be said that Tang Ya and Bei Bei had given him a new life, and Huo Yuhao had always kept this favor deep within his heart. Huo Yuhao’s pain and agony as he witnessed Tang Ya’s current situation wasn’t difficult to imagine. He truly didn’t know how Bei Bei would react if he saw her like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao made a silent vow to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teacher Xiao Ya, we will definitely save you from this place no matter what. We have to help you return to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao’s emotions were riling up, a voice suddenly rang out. “Second brother, Old Seven, you guys are early today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old Seven” naturally referred to the Masquerade Douluo, while “second brother” referred to Nangong Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately withdrew his emotions as he raised his head. However, his emotions quivered vigorously for a moment when he saw who had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person who was speaking to them was the one who was adept with soul tools in the Holy Ghost Church, the Third Elder that Huo Yuhao harbored a deep hatred for. Back then, those three Elders had forced him to burn his spiritual sea before Wang Qiu’er sacrificed herself to save him.</span></p>
