<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei came to Huo Yuhao’s side. When he saw the ice-sealed evil soul master, he couldn’t bother with blaming Huo Yuhao anymore. After all, it was possible to obtain information about Tang Ya from this evil soul master! Even though he was normally very composed, his breathing got heavier now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei lowered his voice and asked, “Can he still recover after being frozen?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “He’ll be fine if it’s within the short-term. However, he has been frozen for quite a while. I didn’t expect to be unconscious for so long, so I’m not confident anymore. However, logically speaking, I still have a chance. After all, this evil soul master is a Soul Sage. Even if he’s frozen, his soul power can still protect his body. Let me give it a try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao lifted his right hand and pressed against the ice statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentle ice elements were drawn out under his meticulous control, fusing back into his body. This was his second time circulating his soul power after waking up from his coma. He was much more aware right now than he had been just after he had just woken up. Suddenly, he could feel how consolidated his soul power was!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just his soul power. His spiritual power had increased too! His soul core had become more and more abstruse, as if it were one with the boundless sky around it. This soul core could devour all, like a black hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What did Long Xiaoyao do to me? Why do I feel such an obvious improvement in my powers? No, when I’m free, I’ll need to take a look in the Academy, and see how strong my soul power has become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ice statue slowly melted under Huo Yuhao’s immaculate control. However, no water dripped out. Under Huo Yuhao’s control, the ice elements vaporized into the air as soon as the ice melted, making the room a little more humid than usual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly, the ice disappeared. The original form of the evil soul master was also revealed. His complexion was softer, but his body functions were still not working.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very quickly, the ice melted completely. Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned dim-grey, and he muttered a few incantations. After that, he smacked the evil soul master’s left chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his third martial soul, his Necromancer martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t use his Ultimate Ice or Spirit Eyes’ spiritual power to resuscitate this evil soul master. The other party would have a great resistance against them due to the massive difference in the elemental types, and they would harm him. At such a moment, the powers of his Necromancer martial soul would be useful. To some extent, a part of Huo Yuhao’s powers belonged to the same origins as evil soul masters, when he used his Necromancer martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dark and sinister power surged into the evil soul master’s body, stimulating his heart. The pressure exerted on his heart got his blood flowing again. Under Huo Yuhao’s control, his blood started to flow with some rhythm once again. After that, Huo Yuhao started to revive his brain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything around him became distorted. Huo Yuhao was using his Imitation right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Imitation combined with his Spiritual Interference Domain, and the lights in Bei Bei’s office dimmed. In addition, the entire room was filled with a sinister aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shot a look at Bei Bei. Bei Bei nodded and pulled Nan Qiuqiu to a dark corner of the room. Although she didn’t know what Huo Yuhao was going to do, she knew that he must have some plan to deal with the evil soul master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like Huo Yuhao had mentioned, the life energy of an evil soul master Soul Sage was very strong. This evil soul master’s heartbeat was slowly returning to normal, enough to send blood to all parts of his body. He was also slowly regaining his awareness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delighted. It seemed like this evil soul master hadn’t suffered any real harm. In this way, he was more confident in waking this evil soul master from his sleep. His vital signs were all fine; he wasn’t too heavily hurt by Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao retrieved a huge black veil from his storage-type soul tool before he put it on. He felt even more sinister and mysterious right now. Dim-greyish air currents revolved around him. As he lifted his left hand, he used his Imitation to form a magic staff with a skull-shaped gem at the top of it. He stood there silently and waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil soul master slowly regained consciousness. When he opened his eyes, he suddenly felt that he was in a comfortable environment. Furthermore, there were even rings of air revolving around him, supporting his body so that he didn’t fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where is this place?” He was evidently a little confused, as he had just awoken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s voice became low-pitched and hoarse. He coldly said, “Are you asking where you are?” As he spoke, he snorted, and his immense spiritual power gently touched the evil soul master’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil soul master was shocked, and immediately regained even further awareness. When he saw Huo Yuhao and the greyish current around him, he was shocked. Huo Yuhao was exuding a very strong spectral aura. Right now, the undulations that Huo Yuhao was projecting were actually those of a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very adept at this. He was imitating his own teacher, Electrolux, right now. Even though he didn’t have the same divine sense as Electrolux, he could still imitate his aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This evil soul master wasn’t fully conscious, and his soul power was still in the process of recovery. His senses weren’t very acute. It was like the break of dawn, when someone had just woken up from sleep. He only felt that Huo Yuhao were extremely strong, but his aura was the same aura of evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil soul master was unsure as he asked, “You, you are…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t need to know who I am.” Huo Yuhao said coldy, “You just need to tell me what happened. Why did you faint by the side of the palace? Who knocked you out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage subconsciously answered, “A Soul Sage invaded the palace and killed one of my subordinates. After I discovered him, I immediately chased him. I gained the upper hand at first, but that person suddenly turned around. I fell into a trance before my entire body felt very cold. After that, I don’t know what happened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you telling the truth? Did you miss anything?” Huo Yuhao said coldly. At the same time, he was also silently unleashing his spiritual power to influence the evil Soul Sage’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I am. Who exactly are you?” The evil Soul Sage mind seemed to clear at this moment. He also looked a little skeptical as he looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t have to care who I am.” Huo Yuhao answered, “I already said that knowing more won’t help you. You just need to know that Sect Leader Zhong Li sent me over to supervise all of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You, you’re from the Imperial Shrine?” The evil Soul Sage seemed to have heard something terrifying, and his voice started trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imperial Shrine?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was moved. He seemed to remember people calling the Holy Ghost Church that before.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then Long Xiaoyao seems to be a member of the Imperial Shrine. He must hold a high position, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s good that you know. Tell me, what else have you missed? Also, what does the person who knocked you out look like?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage laughed bitterly. “I really don’t remember, sir.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you can’t remember, I’ll help you do so. Don’t resist, otherwise you’ll bear the ramifications.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao started reciting incantations. His voice became low-pitched and hoarse, but there seemed to be some special magical power about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage looked at him dumbfoundedly and let him recite his incantations. Bei Bei also started to break out in a sweat.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This guy is too brazen. Although I don’t know what he’s doing, trouble might brew if that evil Soul Sage fights back and attacks him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was very good at this. In addition, his Necromancer abilities were too similar to those of evil soul masters, such that the evil Soul Sage threw away his doubts after sensing Huo Yuhao’s strong necromantic aura. Huo Yuhao’s aura was simply too strong, and he couldn’t resist at all. Moreover, the Imperial Shrine was very respected in the Holy Ghost Church. The evil Soul Sage wasn’t in any position to put up any resistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A layer of pale white light drifted up from Huo Yuhao’s body as he started reciting incantations. Slowly, this pale white light formed flames, which started burning between him and the evil Soul Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil Soul Sage felt his spirit being sucked away just taking a look at it. Slowly, he began to appear very dazed and lost. He seemed to enter a very weird state, as if he had lost his spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Fire of Spiritual Control. It was a strong spell that Electrolux had once used to control some powerful individuals before. However, this spell caused a great backlash too. Unless the other party’s cultivation was far weaker, even Electrolux wouldn’t use it easily.</span></p>
