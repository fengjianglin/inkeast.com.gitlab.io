He had been gone from Shrek Academy for a week. Although he knew that nothing would happen to Wang Dong’er’s internal injury, he was still very anxious. In order to be more prepared to obtain the Yearning Heartbroken Grass, he had to make sufficient preparations. He couldn’t be distracted at all. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a second chance if he failed! This was what he was afraid of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dim light flashed, and Huo Yuhao revealed a focused gleam in his eyes. He clasped his hands in front of his chest. Every time the light in his eyes flashed, the air would distort slightly.</span></p>

He stood up and looked into the distance, in the direction of Shrek Academy.</span></p>

There was only one figure in it, and he started to smile. He recalled the first time he had met Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had been extremely arrogant then! She was obviously a girl, but she dressed up like a guy. No wonder so many weird things had happened.</span></p>

I was stupid, I was really stupid. It was only then that I was certain you were a girl. It was only then that I realized you weren’t a brother or partner to me but…</span></p>

In your heart, I’ve always been very foolish and stupid. However, you fell for me. With your status as the Clear Sky Sect’s young mistress, you must have had many choices. With your ravishing Goddess of Light’s looks, you can attract many guys.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, you chose me.

What kind of pressure have you been under? You never told me. Even when Uncle Niu Tian and Tai Tan doubted me, you stood on my side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You are my goddess, a goddess that I’ll protect with my life. My body, heart and spirit belong to you. Dong’er, I love you.</span></p>

At this point, he seemed to have lost his focus and spirit in his own emotional world. There was a thick sense of love in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er wasn’t standing far away from him. She watched everything quietly. At this moment, she realized that she couldn’t enter Huo Yuhao’s heart like Wang Dong had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her tears started to flow uncontrollably. She was crying in sorrow. Before she had met him, she had never imagined that she would shed tears for a man. However, she was really crying now, and she was even crying for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In just a short seven days, his life had been in danger several times. However, he managed to survive everything because of his love for Wang Dong’er. His love for her was extremely deep.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did I meet him so late?</span></p>

At this moment, she didn’t possess the dominance and toughness of the Golden Dragon anymore. She was only filled with the pain and sorrow of a young girl losing her lover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao continued to walk forward. The Delicate Silk Immortal didn’t help him, but the sentient plants could sense his love, and they all opened a path for him as they pulled away to either side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, he came in front of the pitch-black stone and the white flower that seemed so vulnerable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white flower was shaped like a peony, but it was much thinner than one. It didn’t have any scent, and wasn’t decorated with anything. There wasn’t even a leaf on it. There was only a patch of blood-red on it. It was color filled with sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Yearning Heartbroken Grass. It bloomed and withered only for love.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The divine product in the grass was also of a ten-thousand year level, but it didn’t possess its own intelligence or the strength of a soul beast. It wasn’t that it couldn’t evolve. If it chose to evolve, it would be the strongest out of all the grasses. However, it didn’t do so because it was unwilling. It only wanted to protect its stubbornness for love. It was just like the scholar and Xiao Wu back then, waiting for the right one to come. Once they decided, they were willing to give their everything. This was the stubbornness for love that the Yearning Heartbroken Grass possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stopped and looked down. He looked at the patch of red on the flower that was flashing slightly. Above the patch of red, it really seemed as if fresh blood was flowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er, Dong’er, wait for me. I’ll be back soon.” Huo Yuhao slowly lifted his head, and a dim layer of golden light started to rise from his body. The weird thing was that the golden light was shaped like a flame as it surfaced. It was undulating slightly, as if he was burning his own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea started to shake tremendously at this moment. The pure undulation of his spiritual mind caused his spiritual sea to turn into a smooth icy ocean. A golden figure started to dance amidst this icy ocean. A thick sense of love started to spread in his heart as the Goddess of Light appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was stunned to find out that a projection that was identical to Wang Dong’er had appeared behind Huo Yuhao as the golden flame rose. Yes, she was certain that the projection was Wang Dong’er, even though they looked very similar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the demeanor, aura, and look in the projection’s eyes were all similar to Wang Dong’er. She was smiling. It was a gentle smile, as if she were sensing something. She floated behind Huo Yuhao quietly and shone along with the golden flame that Huo Yuhao emanated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm was the most shocked right now. He crawled out of Huo Yuhao’s body and turned into a ring. He was stunned to see the projection and muttered to himself, “Concrete-immaterial realm. He has done it! He has focused everything into love. He has actually entered such a realm! His Sovereign’s Descent will cease to exist now. What’s left will only be the Goddess of Light that he has comprehended!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power had evolved. He was like Ji Juechen. He had found the path that fused both his spiritual and soul power. It wasn’t the Sovereign’s Descent anymore. The Sovereign’s Descent was created by Elder Mu, but it wasn’t his true path. The Sovereign’s Descent had shown him a smooth road, but at this moment, he had found his own way The name of this path was the same as his lover. It was the Goddess of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned his right palm around and slapped his chest hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wa——” Icy-blue blood spewed out of his mouth, and splattered on the surface of the Yearning Heartbroken Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the Yearning Heartbroken Grass started to shake. Huo Yuhao’s golden projection also turned dim and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared at the divine product in the grass that could give Wang Dong’er life again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pool of blood that he spat out was filled with his love for Wang Dong’er. His palm strike even caused the suppressed origin energy in his body to rage slightly. This origin energy started to course through his meridians.</span></p>

He only widened his eyes and looked at the fresh blood that had landed on the Yearning Heartbroken Grass’ flower.</span></p>

That was because he was stunned to discover that his blood had been affected by his origin energy and turned into ice. His blood didn’t fuse with the flower, but turned to ice instead. It stopped seeping into the petals.</span></p>

That was because they saw Huo Yuhao bursting towards the Blazing Sunspring. It seemed like Huo Yuhao had failed to pluck the Yearning Heartbroken Grass and turned crazy.</span></p>

By the time Wang Qiu’er managed to react, he was already in front of the Blazing Sunspring. Without any hesitation, he kneeled down in front of the Blazing Sunspring. He reached out both his hands into the Sunspring.</span></p>
