 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xian Lin’er, Qian Duoduo and Fan Yu became restless after seeing the Golden Panther being killed by the dark golden radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their original plan, they hadn’t put too much hope into the first few soul beasts for this test. They were mainly there to deplete Huo Yuhao and He Caitou’s soul power. This group of soul beasts that came after that were the primary choice to deal with Huo Yuhao and He Caitou. The lion, tiger, panther and bear were representatives of powerful soul beasts. Their cultivations and metal element were a testament to their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why the metal element was chosen over the more explosive fire element was because Huo Yuhao had the Ultimate Ice. This was a meticulous consideration, but they didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to display the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s ability. Half of the metal-type soul beasts were killed just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou also began to show his powers in this battle. The twelve soul tool cannons were aimed at the Golden Lion on the left. Several streaks of light sealed off all escape routes for the Golden Lion under the guidance of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. The Golden Lion could only defend, and couldn’t advance any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou had four rings. He shouldn’t be too fearful of these soul beasts if he unleashed his soul tool fortress, given his abilities. However, it was impossible for him to take down these soul beasts himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao also made his move while He Caitou acted. His first action was to bend backwards, and he grabbed hold of the Golden Panther’s amputated thigh. After that, he threw it at the Golden Tiger, which was around 20 meters away from him, using his left hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tiger roared furiously and lifted its front claws. It was about to deflect the panther’s thigh away. At this point, Huo Yuhao unleashed another of his divine skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom—</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An explosive force ensued, and ice shavings scattered into the air. Although it was only the panther’s thigh, it was still filled with soul power since it had only just perished. Huo Yuhao initiated the Ice Explosion skill, and the Golden Tiger’s claws seemed to strike a soul tool bomb as it hit the panther’s thigh. In addition, the tiger was completely unprepared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its claws were blown apart amidst the reverberating boom. Its body was sent flying into the air, and the upper half of its body was covered in fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had another title. He was a Tang Sect disciple. At the same time, he chose the Tang Sect as his path after his retreat in the Sea God’s Pavilion. He showed everyone how to use the Tang Sect’s secret weapons. This time, his secret weapon was the Golden Panther that had been cut to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tiger didn’t even have a chance to crawl up before more of the Golden Panther bombs flew towards it. Amidst a series of explosions, the powerful Golden Tiger was killed while Shrek Academy’s elders looked on in shock. It couldn’t even get close to Huo Yuhao, much less make him unleash a soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weakness of metal-type soul beasts was always in terms of long-range attacks. This was also natural given that they were physically tough. Otherwise, they would have become the most outstanding soul beasts around if they were strong in all aspects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew the might of his Ice Explosion skill after his experiences in the Great Star Dou Forest. He almost killed the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear using a ten thousand year Deviltiger Cat’s corpse. While a thousand year soul beast’s body was inferior, the difference wasn’t too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned around calmly after killing the thousand year Golden Tiger. His left hand pressed on the bear that was already dead. The Ice Empress’ Pincer’s diamond flashed with radiance. The Golden Bear was quickly turned into a Transcendent Ice Bomb that could go off at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou’s attacks stopped. A Class 4 Milk Bottle appeared in his palm, and he used it to suck in soul power. In fact, he hadn’t depleted much of his soul power. He could kill the Golden Lion right now if he wanted to, but Huo Yuhao didn’t let him do that. He was following Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Lion felt relieved, but it was in a daze, and couldn’t locate the Golden Tiger. &nbsp;Huo Yuhao tried to provoke him by hooking his finger toward him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lion was the king of beasts! It had a bad temper, and its yellow mane, which was flashing with a metallic glow, started to spike up. It roared ferociously and burst towards Huo Yuhao. Its legs let out clanging metal noises as they struck the ground, it opened its mouth to reveal huge, razor-sharp teeth. Even a Titled Douluo might be unable to handle its bite!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was slightly breathless after killing the tiger. He revealed a soul tool against this Golden Lion that came towards him. It was the soul paralysis ray. The Golden Lion couldn’t escape the rays shot out by him under the influence of his Spiritual Detection. When a streak of light flashed, the attack of the soul paralysis ray was counteracted by a metal-like halo released by the Golden Lion. However, the paralysis effect still took place. The lion’s body shook a little, but it didn’t collapse like the bear as it tried to hold on. However, its speed immediately crumbled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes squinted, and a cold radiance flashed across them. He burst towards the Golden Lion. Looking very ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he got closer to the lion, the paralyzing effects began to wear off. The lion opened its mouth and attempted to bite Huo Yuhao as he shot towards it. Its fur also spiked up and turned into golden spikes. They became defensive weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It unleashed its full abilities as the strongest among these soul beasts. Its eyes flashed with a metal glow, and at least 10% of its mane shot out as sharp spikes. Huo Yuhao was quickly swarmed by a huge number of metal spikes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lion was the only one among these soul beasts that actually had some long-range offensive abilities. However, these metal spikes were most effective at a 5 meter range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao decided to face these metal spikes head-on. He didn’t use a soul tool to protect himself, but instead the Ice Empress’ Armor, one of the two soul skills the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion had given him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his cultivation increased, so too did the power of his soul rings. The Ice Empress’ Armor was defensively stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding ding ding ding ding ding…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A series of knocking sounds rang from Huo Yuhao’s body. The metal spikes bounced off the Ice Empress’ Armor and couldn’t penetrate it. Huo Yuhao also used this opportunity to get closer to the lion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Lion bit down on nothing as the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track was used. Huo Yuhao dodged its bite and came beside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Lion also recognized Huo Yuhao’s frightening Darkgolden Terrorclaws. Its mane started to change form, and its entire head now looked like a giant hedgehog. The lion tried to ram its head towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally tried to prevent that from happening. He moved his body back a little before increasing the speed of the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track. He continued to strike his right hand towards the Golden Lion’s head. He was not bothered about the damage that could be inflicted onto him by the metal spikes, since he had the Ice Empress’ Armor, the Ice Empress’ Pincer, the Mysterious Jade Hands and the Darkgolden Terrorclaws with him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lion lifted its body amidst this crisis and struck its huge claws towards Huo Yuhao. At the same time, a series of clanging noises resonated from its body as two metal blades came out from its shoulders. One of the blades hit Huo Yuhao’s right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greatest advantage from Spiritual Detection was its ability to anticipate situations. Huo Yuhao was clearly prepared for this moment. His Darkgolden Terrorclaw clashed with the metal blade that shot out of the lion’s shoulder, and he wasn’t at a disadvantage in terms of strength. He only rocked his upper body back a little, and the Golden Lion’s body also stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the strength of the Ice Empress’ Pincer and the Mysterious Jade Hands. The metal blade from the lion’s shoulder couldn’t suppress Huo Yuhao in terms of strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already dodged the lion as his figure flashed. His Darkgolden Terrorclaws slashed at the metal blade, his left hand unwittingly grabbed hold of the lion’s left forelimb due to the great impact of his slashing motion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A wave of cold instantly entered the lion’s body. The lion couldn’t help but shiver while its left forelimb was frozen solid, and it no longer had any sensation there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao exploited the momentum of his slash to flip his body around before sliding his body below the lion’s belly.
