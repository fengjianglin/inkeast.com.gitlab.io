 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, when the ministers and generals present in the hall started to believe that Huo Yuhao was an Ultimate Douluo, they changed the way they looked at Xu Sanshi. After seeing this transformation, Xue Kui and Xue Leng revealed grave expressions on their faces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had not expected things to turn out this way. Also, they had not even known that Huo Yuhao was an Ultimate Douluo. Today, when they had brought their most powerful underlings with them along with a Class 9 soul engineer from the Sun Moon Empire, they had planned to go all-out to take down Xu Sanshi and his friends. After all, Xu Sanshi was from Shrek Academy, and they didn’t know what kind of reinforcements the Academy would send to assist or avenge him. They knew they would definitely not be able to go up against the Academy. Hence, they knew that they had to kill Xu Sanshi after taking control of the situation before seizing the palace. And when that was done, both father and son would be able to seize the military and then the throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, they had failed. And good things never happened to those who failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi strolled towards Xue Kui and Xue Leng before speaking plainly, “There is little royal blood left in the Dou Ling Empire. Yet both of you try to launch a coup for your own selfish reasons right after the Sun Moon Empire has threatened our empire. How dare the two of you try to lead your people to attack me? Neither of you can be spared.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Highness, no…” The Prime Minister sensed that something bad was about to happen, but he was already too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi had raised both of his hands and placed them on Xue Kui’s and Xue Leng’s heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, a few people rushed out from the group of generals as they tried to stop Xu Sanshi. However, a white figure flashed before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding temperature plunged again as those generals were instantly turned into ice sculptures. In fact, no one had even seen how Huo Yuhao managed to do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were actually quite a few soul masters with seven or eight rings among the generals. However, even they could not help but shudder after sensing the powerful soul power fluctuations radiating from Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, two loud thuds could be heard as both Xue Kui and Xue Leng started to bleed from their mouths and noses before collapsing onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi took out a handkerchief before using it to wipe his hands, which were not stained with their blood at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is a fact that both Xue Kui and Xue Leng tried to launch a coup against our empire. They deserved to be sentenced to death. However, because of the contributions their family and ancestors made for the empire, and how royal blood is currently scarce within the empire, their families shall be spared. However, their families will be demoted to commoners. Is everyone agreeable with my verdict?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The culprits were already dead. Besides, there was an Ultimate Douluo standing behind Xu Sanshi. Only a fool would dare to go against what he had just announced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi spoke plainly, “I know some of you in the hall have some links to Xue Kui and Xue Leng. However, right now, our empire is short of talent and manpower. Hence, I can pretend as if nothing had happened to preserve the few resources our empire still possesses. I hope that all of you can value your lives and commit to the betterment of our empire. Prime Minister, I will leave it to you to decide who shall take over command of Xue Kui and Xue Leng’s troops.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Your Highness.” The Prime Minister acknowledged with an unwilling look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Xu Sanshi threw the handkerchief in his hand onto the face of the dead Xue Kui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even though the internal conflict within the empire has been settled, we still have external problems to deal with. However, I must admit that I’m not the best at leading an army or fighting wars. I believe that all of you can definitely do that better than me. I must also admit that the internal conflict started because of the power vacuum formed due to the lack of an Emperor. Xue Kui and Xue Leng believed that I was greedy for power. They did not want a person with the surname of Xu to take away the empire built by the Xue family. This was the most important reason why they wanted to start a coup. I found it hilarious because I had never wanted to become an Emperor. I have always been living a free and easy life. So let me now lay down a few important things.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Xu Sanshi raised his hands and took the purple-gold crown off his head. Following which, he returned to the throne and placed the crown on the seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now that the internal affairs of the empire have been temporarily stabilized, I think it’s time for all of you to decide who shall inherit the throne. My mother will definitely be staying in the empire, and she will make the final decision as to who shall become the new Emperor. I will now give up my Prince Regent title. From today onwards, Xu Sanshi shall not have any ties or relationship to the Dou Ling Empire. I have already done enough as someone who possesses royal blood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing his sentence, Xu Sanshi walked to the side and grabbed Jiang Nannan’s hand. Following which, he sauntered out of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single minister and general was shocked by what they had just witnessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What is going on? Is he quitting? Did he just quit his appointment as the Prince Regent and turn down his potential position as the Emperor?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Xu Sanshi was the only male with royal blood in the entire Dou Ling Empire. Because of what Xue Kui and Xue Leng had done, their descendants no longer had a chance of succeeding the throne.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What will happen to the empire now that Xu Sanshi is leaving? Who’s going to become the Emperor?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Prime Minister, who was usually very calm and composed, started to panic as he knelt down on the ground immediately. “Your Highness, please stay!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ministers and generals knelt down in unison as they exclaimed, “Please stay, Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi held Jiang Nannan’s hand as he stopped walking. “I am both a member of Shrek Academy and a member of the Tang Sect. I don’t usually spend my time mulling over political matters. In fact, I have always been a happy-go-lucky person. But ever since I have arrived at the Dou Ling Empire, I have stopped smiling. Every day, I am suffering under the immense pressure that comes with my position. In addition, all of you have never given me your fullest support. But I understand why you chose to do that. After all, my surname is Xu, not Xue. This is a fundamental difference which is almost irreconcilable. Also, I have never learned how to be an emperor, and have never wanted to learn it. I have no interest in becoming the Emperor of the Dou Ling Empire. I have already made my decision, and none of you need to stop me. All of you should know that it would be futile. With my little junior brother around, none of you will be able to stop me. If all of you still want the Xue family to stay in power, please allow my mother to reign from behind the curtains. After all, she has the Xue surname. It will be a lot easier for you to accept her. In the future, after my wife has given birth to our first son, I will give him the surname of Xue. If no one opposes it, I will send him back here to receive his education in the Dou Ling Empire. That’s all I have to say. Goodbye.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, Xu Sanshi held Jiang Nannan’s hand before leaping upwards. Following which, both of them flew out of the palace from the hole in the roof.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong, Ye Guyi, Nan Qiuqiu, and Ji Juechen transformed into seven streaks of light and followed right behind them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xue Lingxun sat down at where Xu Sanshi used to sit as the edge of her mouth twitched on its own. She had not known that Xu Sanshi was planning to do this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could that little rascal not inform me of his plan in advance?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And he just left like that? That’s too unbecoming of him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking down all of his potential competitors, he left without even bidding a proper goodbye. This was his act of revenge for all the grievances he had felt. Even though the Dou Ling Empire’s internal politics were now a lot more stable, how could they function without a leader? However, it was important to note that Xu Sanshi did not leave in an entirely irresponsible fashion. After all, there was a reason why he had made a proper introduction for Huo Yuhao before he left. He wanted to remind the ministers and generals that the Xue family had the support of an Ultimate Douluo. In addition, his mother was backed by Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect. He wanted to let them know that they had better think twice before trying to seize political power from the Xue family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was indeed a very shrewd move. However, Xue Lingxun could not help but feel that it was a wasteful act from her son to give up the throne so easily. She came to the conclusion that different types of people were made for different things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After soaring up into the sky, Xu Sanshi broke out into a loud laugh. The smile which had been missing for a while had finally returned to his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan also revealed a gentle smile. She was definitely the person who understood Xu Sanshi best. She had seen how stressed he had become since he took on the Prince Regent position. Now that he was released from this stress, how could she not be happy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sanshi, is it really okay for us to do this?” Jiang Nannan asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi stopped laughing, but his smile was still on his face. “What’s wrong with this? We have already done our best to stabilize the empire. After all, what’s so good about being an emperor? Do you really think I care so much about such things? In this world, there are only a few things I truly care about—my parents, family, friends, and you. What’s the use of having so much power? It won’t be as fun as touring the world with you. I am so glad I have broken free from the clutches of those fellows. Did you see how displeased they looked when we left? It was so hilarious. They looked as though they had just eaten shit. Little junior brother, have you taken care of those people?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “I have taken care of them. Those soul masters were merely taking orders from Xue Kui and Xue Leng. I have interrogated them, and they have all expressed their desire to atone for their mistakes by working hard for their new leader. I have left a seal on them, and have passed the method to control the seal to your mother. If they are to harbor any malicious intent against your mother, they will die instantly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the successor of a necromancer, it was not difficult for Huo Yuhao to plant such seals on people. With the help and support of those Titled Douluo, Soul Douluo, and Soul Sages, Xue Lingxun would be able to protect herself. This was also why Xu Sanshi was able to leave without any worries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think I’d go crazy if I were to continue to stay at that place even after being freed from my responsibilities.” Xu Sanshi admitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tried to change the topic. “Third senior brother, how could you betray me like this? When have I become an Ultimate Douluo? Do you know that the words you have said today will spread across the entire continent like wildfire? Now that the Holy Ghost Church and the Sun Moon Empire are coming after me, I already have enough trouble on my plate.”</span></p>

Even though you’re not yet an Ultimate Douluo, I believe you’re not too much different from it, right? I might not have become a Titled Douluo, but I believe I can still tell certain things apart. The aura you released when you were dealing with those fellows was more or less on par with that of an Ultimate Douluo. The fact that you were able to freeze so many powerful soul masters with just a single soul skill means that your fighting power is comparable to that of an Ultimate Douluo. On top of that, you have already told me what your martial soul fusion with Wutong can accomplish. So you can stop pretending to the rest of us! The two of you are now somewhat equivalent to an Ultimate Douluo. In this case, I think the Tang Sect will really need to depend on you in the future. In fact, I don’t think the Academy will let you go so easily either. You’ll probably become the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion in no time. After all, with great power comes great responsibility.”</span></p>
