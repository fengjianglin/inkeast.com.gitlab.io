 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 11.4: The Weakest Class Monitor</strong></p>
 <p>“AHH—” A slightly scream echoed out. Following that, the patch of white in front of Huo Yuhao’s eyes became a patch of dazzling blue.</p>
 <p>A pair of enormous wings suddenly spread out, and what immediately followed that was a V-shape made of golden haloes that suddenly brightened. The sapphire blue wings subsequently turned a blueish-violet. A strong undulation of soulforce immediately rushed out, as if it wanted to devour him.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the wave-like soulforce still stopped in the end.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing? Why didn’t you knock?” Wang Dong’s anger-filled voice echoed out. The blue light vanished, and when Huo Yuhao looked again, he’d already put on a set of school clothes. He’d suddenly charged over, but hadn’t made a move against Huo Yuhao in the end. This was because Huo Yuhao, who had just cleaned himself up, was only wearing his boxers now; his entire body was clean. However, when one compared the colour of his skin to Wang Dong’s, it wasn’t just a difference of colour. Huo Yuhao’s skin flickered with a healthy copper colour, but it was far inferior to Wang Dong’s enchanting white skin...</p>
 <p>“I… someone outside called for me. I was in a hurry, sorry!” Huo Yuhao didn’t know why, but his heartbeat had turned especially quick. He hurriedly ran to his bed and grabbed his clean school uniform before turning around and quickly running outside.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong stood there blankly, not stopping Huo Yuhao. Only when Huo Yuhao had shut the door and run off did he come back to his senses. Flashes of both red and white appeared on his face, but he didn’t know what to do about it.</p>
 <p>After hurriedly running out of the dorm room, Huo Yuhao’s mind calmed down a bit. However, that white patch still lingered in his mind. Especially those buttocks, which already stuck out a bit...</p>
 <p>What am I thinking about! Huo Yuhao felt some self-disdain towards himself. He hurriedly shifted his thoughts towards the Mysterious Heaven Technique,</p>
 <p>His ear suddenly hurt, and he let out a pained cry.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya’s playful voice sounded out, “You still know how to cry out? I’ve been waiting here for a long time.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao miserably said, “Teacher Xiao Ya, please let go. We just had a physical class that made me sweat a lot, so wouldn’t I first return to my dorm to clean up before I came?”</p>
 <p>Only then did Tang Ya let go of him. As she looked at Huo Yuhao’s slightly pale face, her eyebrows furrowed. She said, “Is that perverted grandma Zhou Yi making things hard for you guys? You have to be a bit more careful, as she’s always been widely known as an iron mask. You’ll lose a layer of skin, if not die, if you offend her. How is it? Is your body still fine? If you’re not fine, then so be it. We can talk tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hurriedly shook his head and said, “Teacher Xiao Ya, I’m fine. Let’s go.” Today’s physical training had brought him take one step closer to realising that he needed nutrients, and a large amount of nutrients at that. That warm feeling created by the Mysterious Heaven Technique had disappeared, but it caused an intense surge of hunger to rise up from his body. If he had no money, what could he buy to eat?</p>
 <p>Tang Ya giggled and said, “Then you can roast twenty fish. I’ve prepared them for you. It won’t take too much of your time, but it’ll definitely take less than you working for the academy.”</p>
 <p>“Teacher Xiao Ya, then where are we going to sell them?” Huo Yuhao asked.</p>
 <p>Clearly. Tang Ya had already thought about it thoroughly. “At the academy’s entrance! Our Shrek Academy’s entrance is the eastern gate of Shrek City, and there has always been many peddlers outside. Furthermore, there’s no lack of academy students who do business there. With your skill in roasting fish, we won’t need to be afraid of not selling any if we go there. Even if we’re unable to sell them, we can just eat them for ourselves.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao followed Tang Ya all the way until they reached the gate. When they stepped outside, Huo Yuhao was astonished. As of now, there were no longer any students here to enroll. Instead, both sides of the eastern gate’s main road were swarming with peddlers. The peddlers were selling everything that could possibly be imagined, and their goods looked like glittering jewels. Out of the goods that were on display, the large variety of food was the greatest. Moreover, the sounds of hawkers doing their job never stopped. Clearly, the reason that they’d gathered here was for the sake of doing business with the students of Shrek Academy.</p>
 <p>Tang Ya was clearly slightly impatient. In an area that wasn’t too far from the city gates, she took out the stuff that she’d prepared. She even took up a bit of the main road.</p>
 <p>She was clearly completely prepared. She had a metal grill that had been specially made by a smith, metal stands, various seasonings, as well as mackerels that had already been cleaned. She’d even brought a small table for the sake of setting all of her stuff down.</p>
 <p>As Huo Yuhao helped her set up the grill, he couldn’t help but find it funny. Teacher Xiao Ya’s resistance towards delicious food was really low!</p>
 <p>Tang Ya also took out the charcoal and put it on the floor before saying, “Okay, my job is done. Everything else is up to you. I’m gonna go buy some other stuff to eat, just remember that two of these fish are mine. Just sell them for five copper coins. In the future, if you want to buy ingredients, just find your canteen’s Aunty Lin.”</p>
 <p>After saying this, she excitedly ran off.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao checked the amount ingredients that he had before he prepared the mackerels. The number of ingredients that he had was truly large, and Tang Ya was quite considerate. She’d even brought him some purple basil. Huo Yuhao tore up the purple basil, then stirred it together with some of the other ingredients. After the ingredients were ready, he stuffed them into the belly of the mackerels, then used a bamboo stick to skewer them one-by-one.</p>
 <p>Today’s physical class had made him understand many things, so he was anxious to go back and cultivate. Naturally, he didn’t want to waste too much time here.</p>
 <p>Simply lighting a fire was as easy as a walk in the park for him, so after a moment’s work, the oven already had a few bright red pieces of burning coal inside of it. The oven was quite big, and was able to hold four fish at once. Thus, he roasted the fish directly.</p>
 <p>It had to be said that Huo Yuhao’s level of skill with roasting fish was truly unrivalled. Not long after he’d started, a strong fragrance had already diffused outwards from his makeshift stall. This was better than any other form of advertisement. Not even mentioning the students from the academy, even the surrounding peddlers couldn’t help but cast a few curious gazes at him.</p>
 <p>A male student who was wearing a yellow school uniform walked over and asked, “Little brother, how much are you selling these roasted fish for?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao answered with a very polite tone, “Senior, the roasted fishes are five copper coins each.”</p>
 <p>That student was very straightforward. “It smells quite good. Let me try one.” While he spoke, he handed five copper soul coins to Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>This was Huo Yuhao’s first successful transaction, so he couldn’t help but feel excited. After receiving the copper coins, he became even more serious while roasting the fish, so much so that he even roused some of the soulforce he’d just recovered in order to use his Spiritual Detection to better control the heat.</p>
 <p>With the first customer, there would naturally be more people who’d come over. Only, this was the first time that Huo Yuhao had appeared here. His fish smelled quite good, and nobody knew how they tasted. Practically all of the people who came over were students from Shrek Academy who’d just been dismissed for the day.</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao passed the roasted mackerel over to the yellow-shirted student, everyone else couldn’t help but look at him in expectation.</p>
