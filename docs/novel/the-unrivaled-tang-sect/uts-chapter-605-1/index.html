 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The explosion lasted for more than ten seconds before it slowly faded away. When Zhong Liwu crawled up from the ground, all he saw was a land wrecked by a devastating explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many rare metals had been melted, and many resources had been vaporized. What hurt him the most was that many of the lower to mid-tier evil soul masters had disappeared without a trace. There was no other possibility, given the magnitude of this devastating attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who is it? Who’s capable of finding this mysterious place and using a stationary shell on it without any hesitation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Moon Empire. It has to be Xu Tianran!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu had already turned pale green. He regretted not listening to his mother and evacuating the lower to mid-tier soul masters first. To save time, he made them all move the resources out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one with less than seven rings could survive this explosion. Even those who had seven rings or more needed some subconscious help from the evil Titled Douluo to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Ghost Church’s defense was normally not so lax. However, they had dismantled a lot of their defenses because they had to move their resources. Who would have expected someone to attack at such an opportune time?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Didn’t mother go to Radiant City? How is it that the Sun Moon Empire is able to attack this place? Furthermore, how did they know we’re here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The place was still burning. The protective soul barriers were completely wrecked. The region that was blown up was completely charred too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Less than a hundred evil soul masters had survived this explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul tools. This was the strength of a soul tool. More terrifyingly, this huge explosion had completely destroyed the future of the Holy Ghost Church!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu gritted his teeth, and his eyes turned red. However, following this, he felt the original burning temperature disappearing. What replaced it was extreme cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was snow. Snowflakes were falling from the sky. The dancing snowflakes resembled penguin feathers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hazy clouds were surrounded by snowflakes. Very soon, the earth turned white. Even the charred region was covered by snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The residual temperature of the ground seemed to be useless against these snowflakes. The snowflakes didn’t even melt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao drifted in mid-air like a sovereign watching his world. He held Tang Wutong’s hand, and his Spiritual Detection had already covered a large area around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he had used Tai Ah wasn’t because he thought he couldn’t deal with these evil soul masters. It was because he didn’t want any loopholes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If any evil soul master escaped, disaster might ensue. This was why he had to be merciless if he wanted to get rid of all evil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu seemed to sense something. After he got up, he immediately looked into the sky. There was a horrified look on his face. Right now, he felt as if he was being dissected and displayed in the open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As snowflakes danced, the air temperature fell dramatically. Less than a hundred evil soul masters survived, and many of the survivors were injured. This was the strength of a Class 9 stationary soul shell. If one wasn’t prepared to face it, it could be lethal. This was what had happened in the Dou Ling Empire’s Imperial Palace. Right now, the Holy Ghost Church suffered the same fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An extremely chilly aura descended. Some evil soul masters inadvertently touched those snowflakes, and were shocked to realize that the snowflakes were not as soft and weak as they looked. They were actually as hard as rocks. One would instantly sense an unprecedented chill invading his body the moment he touched it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was bone-chilling. It was as if their marrow was about to be frozen right there and then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul masters were stronger than ordinary people. However, even a Titled Douluo couldn’t survive for long when the temperature was negative one hundred and fifty degrees Celsius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the snowflakes descended, Zhong Liwu immediately knew who had come. What left him depressed was that this person’s ability seemed to be stronger than it was in the previous fight.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What? How is he able to grow so rapidly? Why is he so terrifying? How did he find this place?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scatter, flee!” Zhong Liwu shouted. He suddenly increased his speed and charged deeper into the forest. Feng Ling followed closely behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a clear-white halo fell from the sky and engulfed all the evil soul masters. None of them were left out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you escape though?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snowflakes turned into terrifying, sharp weapons. As they danced in the air, they turned into sharp blades. These blades critically hurt the evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light projections fell from the sky. There were snow fairies, jade-green snowflakes, and even giant bears. A massacre began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. This was the true, perfect version of the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. Even the Snow Empress couldn’t unleash it to such a standard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was because Huo Yuhao’s Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice fused the domain-type abilities of both the Ice and Snow Empresses. It combined their strengths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such a low temperature, only someone who possessed Ultimate Ice could adapt. The Snow Empress, Ice Empress and Ice Bear King all descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Huo Yuhao’s second soul core was completed, they were all able to make great use of his strength. It was as if they were as strong as they were before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No evil soul master could block their attack. Not a single one. All of them were like helpless little kids as they were continuously turned into ice statues or crushed into powder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white halo that fell from the sky was Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement. There was no one else in the continent right now whose spiritual-type soul skills were as terrifying as Huo Yuhao’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whirlpool-like soul power generated from his Yin-Yang Complement soul cores ensured that every soul skill was of two different types, spiritual and ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, every evil soul master didn’t just feel weak when Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement struck them. They also felt a chill that invaded their spiritual seas. It was as if their consciousness was being frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two Ultimate Douluo of the Holy Ghost Church were no longer around, and Huo Yuhao had already killed many of their Transcendent Douluo. The ones who remained weren’t that strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, they only wanted to flee. They wanted to escape from this terrifying hell of ice and snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Singing voices rang out, and the Princess of the Sea began singing in the air. Icy-blue halos spread out. It was an enhancement that the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass brought to the Snowy Domain of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five Spirits. It was as if there were two Ultimate Douluo teaming up with three Transcendent Douluo. Although they couldn’t limitlessly tap into Huo Yuhao’s strength, it was enough to deal with these evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Zhong Liwu and Feng Ling managed to rush out from the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice as they escaped immediately. They didn’t flee far away, but started to venture deeper and deeper into the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many soul beasts inside the forest. It was only by rushing in that they might possibly survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu didn’t even think of resisting Huo Yuhao. His injuries hadn’t even healed since the last fight. His Bone Dragon King was also gone. Right now, he wasn’t in his best state, and the aura that came from Huo Yuhao’s domain made him extremely afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimate Douluo, this was clearly the pressure that came from an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was very familiar with such pressure. He had experienced it from his own mother and Long Xiaoyao before. However, he hadn’t expected Huo Yuhao to become an Ultimate Douluo so soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t even have any intention of guessing right now. He didn’t have the time. Right now, he only wanted to flee. He wanted to flee far away. He had to preserve his life first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu was no longer young. However, he was still very concerned about his own reputation. The longer he lived, the less reluctant he was to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop.” A voice sounded from the sky. To Zhong Liwu, it was like lightning striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling roared, and flames started to burn on her body. The Dark Phoenix immediately rose. Strong flames burned everything around her, and thick smoke started to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two figures descended from the sky. The flames that were burning the forest were instantly put out. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were holding hands as they descended in front of Feng Ling and Zhong Liwu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw them, Zhong Liwu’s last glimmer of hope was crushed. Yes, they clearly had the aura of Ultimate Douluo. And it wasn’t just one person, it was both of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Against two Ultimate Douluo, how could they survive?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Out of respect for Elder Long and Elder Ye, I can preserve your corpses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu looked at Huo Yuhao coldly. “Do you really think you’re going to win? You’ve killed so many from the Holy Ghost Church today. If we can escape today, we’ll use every means at our disposal to turn Shrek City into a ghost city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed sarcastically. “First, you won’t have that chance. Second, if the Holy Ghost Church is so capable, Shrek City would have long since ceased to exist. You weren’t able to do it in the past, and you won’t do it in the future. Do you think Shrek can be poisoned by you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong let go of Huo Yuhao’s hand. She took a step forward towards Zhong Liwu and Feng Ling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao still had to control the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, and his soul power was still being used by his five Spirits. On the other hand, she was in perfect condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling attacked first. She couldn’t take the oppressive atmosphere anymore. Dark flames were unleashed. They didn’t spread this time, but formed a line of fire aimed at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong laughed coldly, and a blinding ring of sunlight shone behind her. The sunlight was purplish-gold, and it turned into a giant wheel of light behind her. Feng Ling’s line of fire was crushed before it was even in front of Tang Wutong.</span></p>
