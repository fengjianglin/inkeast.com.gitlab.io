 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These rays contained the effects of spatial power. It was extremely difficult to destroy them. It was almost impossible to dodge them too. This made it extremely difficult to resist them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong struggled before she escaped from the first hit from spiritual numbness. As her figure flashed, she arrived behind Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her body started to glow with a layer of purplish-gold light after she moved behind Huo Yuhao. She appeared very dignified, and a light fog rose around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shone with blue light. His Icy War God Armor quickly engulfed his entire body. He lifted his Morning Dew Dagger and slashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A weird intent was released from his body. It was one of excitement. Even the Evileye Tyrant King was affected, and felt very joyous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rays that had locked onto his enemies earlier suddenly took a turn and shot towards Huo Yuhao. It was where he used his dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A spatial crack suddenly opened, and swallowed all eighty rays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? What kind of ability is this?” The Evileye Tyrant King was curious. This was because he was astonished to discover that he had lost control of his rays when Huo Yuhao slashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Spiritual power! Don’t tell me anyone else is prohibited from specializing in spiritual power apart from you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he was using his power of emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After these years of training and cultivation, he had developed his own understanding of the power of emotions. Even though it wasn’t very profound yet, it was still very useful to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, he unleashed happiness, an emotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While that slash seemed very ordinary, it was actually a self-created soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s pupil shrank a little. “Spiritual power. Very good, kid. No matter what happens today, I must leave you here. If I let you develop any further, you might actually threaten me one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “I wanted to keep things harmonious between us, but you had to bring it to this stage. Since this is the case, I must kill you no matter what. You’ll become my ninth soul ring. You are the one who first attacked us. Don’t blame us for being merciless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he finished speaking, Huo Yuhao’s body started to experience changes. A beam of bright golden light was instantly unleashed from his body. At the same time, whether it was the Ice Empress, the Snow Empress or the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass, they instantly fused back into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That beam of golden light broke the sky. The originally dark-red sky was instantly torn open. Then, another beam of golden light descended from the sky and met Huo Yuhao’s. Dense icy fog started to spread from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huge dragon wings opened up behind him. Tang Wutong, who was behind Huo Yuhao, disappeared. As he was in his Icy War God Armor, whatever was happening to his body couldn’t be seen from the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a step forward, and a streak of silver light appeared in front of him. Suddenly, he transcended space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” The Evileye Tyrant King was astonished. When that beam of golden light descended onto Huo Yuhao’s body, he instantly felt as if Huo Yuhao had completely changed. His earlier aura had completely transformed, as if he had become a being of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s pupil shrank before dilating. This time, he turned completely dark green. A terrifying killing aura spread from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky also turned dark green. Only that beam of golden light that had struck Huo Yuhao remained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver light flashed again. When Huo Yuhao re-appeared, he was a hundred meters in front of the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s tentacles were furiously reaching for him, hoping to block him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted his right hand and slashed his Morning Dew Dagger. This time, the emotion that was unleashed was sorrow. The tentacles were guided to one side again as they were affected by this sorrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Light of Destruction!” The tone of the Evileye Tyrant King’s voice was very weird. Every time he mentioned a word, the air would distort strangely. His terrifying spiritual power seemed to become a real entity. At the next instant, a dark green beam of light that was around a hundred meters long shot out at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Huo Yuhao didn’t know was that the longer the lights unleashed by the Evileye Tyrant King, the weaker they were. Even Di Tian had to pay a huge price if he wanted to resist this Light of Destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what left the Evileye Tyrant King extremely astonished was that Huo Yuhao seemed to have become illusory after he suffered this attack. Nothing appeared to have affected him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If there were any changes to speak of, it was that there was a beautiful mermaid projection behind him. Captivating mermaid singing also started to sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Morning Dew Dagger shone extremely brightly. The air turned unprecedentedly chilly. The temperature reached negative two hundred and sixty degrees Celsius, slowing down the tentacles that were approaching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How is this possible? How is he fine after being struck by my Light of Destruction? Impossible, this is impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King was horrified. At this instant, he felt a huge sense of crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strong beam of light was unleashed from Huo Yuhao’s body. Following this, a golden hammer rose from his back, and instantly arrived in front of the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were too close. The instant pressure that surfaced caused the Evileye Tyrant King’s pupil to cave in a little. A strong spiritual barrier was immediately unleashed from his pupil, and clashed with the golden hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual barrier was immediately frozen. After this, it started to crack, and golden lights shone in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blaze Amidst the Frost, Heavenly Emperor's Hammer</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King’s body shook a little, but he also demonstrated his transcendent abilities as the second-ranked of the Ten Great Savage Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he suffered this blow, his pupil turned deep-blue. After this, a three-meter long deep-blue light shot out from his pupil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this deep-blue light appeared, time seemed to stop. Huo Yuhao, who was lifting his Morning Dew Dagger, was completely restrained in mid-air at this instant. Everything around him was rapidly compressing. The deep-blue light was moving very slowly. However, the sky and the ground turned deep-blue just as it shifted. Everything about the Evileye Tyrant King turned deep-blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Space-Time Light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Evileye Tyrant King’s highest level of understanding. He had relied on this immense skill to escape from Di Tian’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood the strength of time through his understanding of spiritual power and space. This was the power of time that originated from his spiritual origin. The power of time could snatch away the spiritual origin of living creatures, causing their spiritual origins to weaken instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Di Tian had critically hurt him, Di Tian had also needed a thousand years to recover to his peak state after he was struck by this Space-Time Light. This showed how powerful it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the deep-blue Space-Time Light struck Huo Yuhao, the frosty aura he had released turned deep-blue. His entire body also turned deep-blue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King finally heaved a sigh of relief. After he was able to unleash his Space-Time Light, the only creature who had managed to survive was Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, the Evileye Tyrant King had to pay a huge price to unleash his Space-Time Light. He drained his own life energy to use it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to know that his next catastrophe was imminent. It was almost fatal to him to have drained his life energy. However, the sense of crisis that Huo Yuhao had brought him earlier was simply too scary. When it came to his tier, he was very confident in his own senses. He didn’t doubt them at all. This was why he used his Space-Time Light without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chi—"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King shook a little. A strong intent was instantly unleashed from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was one of disbelief!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he was in disbelief! This was because a sharp blade that was flashing with dense icy fog had stabbed right into the center of his pupil. A figure was holding that sharp blade, with a hint of the deep-blue light from earlier still on him.</span></p>
