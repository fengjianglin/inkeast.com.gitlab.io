If he was the brains and life and soul of the team, Bei Bei was the backbone. He had the utmost respect for his eldest senior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “We need to stay as far from Radiant City as possible. Yuhao, when the sky is dark, go out and quickly return. Let’s return to the academy and take a look. We want to bring news back, and also take a look at the situation at the front line before we proceed with our next operation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao had no objections to Bei Bei’s suggestion. It was better to stabilize things too. However, he didn’t mention that he one other thing to do before he returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among everyone, He Caitou was the only one who was a little unhappy. He said, “Yuhao, let’s attack more soul formations in the Sun Moon Empire when we return. We’ve been greatly drained this time too!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi laughed, “Caitou, since when have you become a slave to money?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou snapped, “It’s money! Do you know how many soul cannon shells we’ve used this time? We even left a defensive soul formation. I feel heart-ache! It’s not easy to manufacture. We don’t have the manufacturing ability of the Sun Moon Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei commented, “Caitou is right. When we return, let’s not attack Radiant City. We’ll mainly attack places where there are soul formations, and try our best to cause destruction. From there, we can improve our abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou was thinking about gold soul coins, and he muttered to himself, “If only we could rob the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion. If our Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion can change into human-shaped soul tools too, who’s going to be afraid of them? Hehe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cheh!” Everyone scowled at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Were they even capable of challenging the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Huo Yuhao looked a little pensive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Plundering the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was definitely not possible. However, they could learn new things if they could obtain a human-shaped soul tool from the Sun Moon Soul Engineer Legion and pass it to Teacher Xuan. This would greatly benefit Shrek Academy in their development of human-shaped soul tools in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, only Huo Yuhao and Nan Qiuqiu were equipped with human-shaped soul tools, even though Teacher Xuan had managed to create a few. They were used for close-combat, and couldn’t be replicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they couldn’t be replicated, they couldn’t be mass produced. This wasn’t a good thing. Huo Yuhao was a Class 9 soul engineer himself. He was also curious how the Sun Moon Empire managed to mass produce human-shaped soul tools. It was important to know that the strength of the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions would rise by another tier now that they had managed to mass produce human-shaped soul tools. They would be even more difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone continued to rest. When night fell, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong silently left the spectral demiplane and re-appeared in the small forest where they had opened the spectral door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind was gentle, and the night was extremely quiet. The fragrance of plants lingered in the air, and the buzzing of bugs and chirping of birds could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand as they walked out from the spectral demiplane. They took in a deep breath. The night breeze was refreshing, and they immediately felt invigorated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how safe the spectral demiplane was, it wasn’t as comfortable as the Douluo Continent. This was where they truly belonged!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t rush to leave, but leaned against a tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was a little curious as she looked at him. She asked, “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao placed his index finger on his lips and gestured to her, “Shh!” After this, he called her over with his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong walked in front of him, and became even more puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pulled her to his side and let her lean on his shoulder. He gently caressed her pinkish-blue hair. He also shared his spiritual world with her using his Spiritual Detection Sharing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Detection Sharing? Tang Wutong had the feeling that Huo Yuhao was acting weirdly. However, her eyes unwittingly opened wide in the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual senses extended without any boundaries. This wasn’t very strange. However, joyous and gentle undulations were nourishing her spiritual world within his spiritual senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There seemed to be countless little living spirits that were telling her how beautiful the world was. They were telling her about themselves. Her spiritual power fused into that ocean of joy, while her spiritual senses also spread outward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a beautiful feeling. Tang Wutong’s spiritual power wasn’t as strong as Huo Yuhao’s. This was why she felt it more deeply as she was immersed in this world. Her own spiritual power was also enhanced amidst this feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were someone else, Huo Yuhao might not have been able to do this. After all, he couldn’t share the minor changes in his spiritual world with anyone else. However, Tang Wutong was different. Their martial souls were compatible, and they even had Haodong Power. They were very closely connected. This was why he and Tang Wutong were like a single entity when he completely let go of his body. It was as if they had unleashed the Raiment of Light and summoned the Goddess of Light. In this situation, Tang Wutong could clearly sense everything that he sensed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong seemed to fuse with their surroundings. They became a part of the plants around them. If one didn’t use their eyes to see, it would be impossible to detect their auras at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong reopened her eyes, the sky was already hazily bright. The chirping and buzzing of birds and bugs became much softer. The forest was moist as dew formed. It was dawn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao opened his eyes along with her. The two of them looked at each other and revealed grins on their faces. They were so telepathic that they didn’t need to communicate with words anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a few hours, Tang Wutong seemed to have completely changed. She improved significantly after her spiritual world completely fused with the world of plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cultivating under such a circumstance was equivalent to receiving the help of countless plants. At the same time, their spiritual power was helping the plants too. These plants that cultivated along with them were definitely more likely to become plant-type soul beasts in the future, and develop their own sentience and intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong took out their dry rations and ate a simple meal. After this, they continued on their journey. Through his observation of the outside world using his spiritual power that was connected to the plants, Huo Yuhao had determined that the surrounding environment was safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After flying for a while, Tang Wutong revealed a strange look. “Aren’t we returning? This place doesn’t seem right.” The direction they should be taking to return was supposed to be east, but Huo Yuhao was clearly dragging her to the west.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “I want to give eldest senior a surprise. That’s why I didn’t mention this earlier. You’ll know later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pursed her lips, but didn’t probe further. She shut her eyes and let Huo Yuhao guide her as they flew, and she continued to understand the feeling that those plants gave her last night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such an enhancement was extremely important to her. She was already a Titled Douluo. If she wanted to further improve her cultivation, it was very critical for her to raise her spiritual cultivation. This would definitely speed up the increase of her abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They proceeded west, and went around Radiant City. Although aerial surveillance soul tools occasionally appeared where they passed, Huo Yuhao would always be able to find them beforehand. His spiritual power was very strong. He was in fact the strongest surveillance soul tool in the world right now. There was no need for him to worry about being found out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They made a round from the west before making one big round and flying towards the south. Undoubtedly, they were getting further and further from Shrek Academy as they flew in this direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After flying for a good two hours, Tang Wutong couldn’t help but ask, “Yuhao, what are we going to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed mysteriously and replied, “Do you still remember what happened last night? I want to bring you to the place where I first had that feeling. You’ll naturally understand when we get there. We’re almost there. Don’t be anxious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another hour passed. Huo Yuhao finally proceeded towards ground level as he held Tang Wutong’s hand. Right now, the sky had already turned bright, and the sun was shining very strongly. The temperature in the south was much higher than in the north. Right now, the ground temperature was no longer low. Heat was quickly invading their bodies. However, Huo Yuhao exuded a cool and refreshing aura, dissipating all the heat.</span></p>
