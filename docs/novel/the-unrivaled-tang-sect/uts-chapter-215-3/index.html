There was firm ice beneath her feet, so there was a lot of strength in this push, and she drifted into the sky as if gravity wasn’t acting on her. She spun around in place after she landed back on the water’s surface, and a layer of white soul power rippled forward, prssing down on the surface of the water and stably lifting her into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two yellow, two purple, and three black soul rings hummed in rhythm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young woman looked to be only twenty-seven or twenty-eight. She wasn’t that pretty, but she had an extremely gentle face, and seemed as amiable as could be. She didn’t use any soul skills at all, relying purely upon control of her soul power to hover above the water’s surface. It seemed easy and simple, but it was exceptionally difficult to control, and all the guys gave her a round of applause and calls of awe and admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao also exclaimed his admiration. At least with his current cultivation, there was no way he could achieve that no matter how good he was at controlling his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Hua Yao, and my martial soul is the Lotus. I’m a control-type Soul Sage, and I am thirty-one years old. I wish to find a gentle and mild-natured man as my partner, while being plain and simple is the life I wish for.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a simple introduction, but it gave people a fantastic impression. She was already thirty-one years old, but such an age gap wasn’t really a problem in higher-level soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan smiled and asked, “So, who do you choose?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Yao blushed faintly, and her figure started to drift forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fourth segment, the Three Lifetimes of Fate, wasn’t as simple as Zhang Lexuan had just described. The girls faced a tough choice in this segment. Since they were going before the guys, they had to make sure they didn’t fall into the water. The water couldn’t take any weight at all, so it was hard to say whether they could last until the end of this segment and into the last one. Whether the guys that the girls chose would be courteous and chivalrous enough to give them their water lilies also represented their choices in the final segment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Yao quickly came before the male students, and surveyed the people before her. Her eyes finally landed on a male student that looked around thirty years of age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This man was tall and slender, his appearance quite typical, but he looked steady and composed. His performance in every round had been normal and orderly, and he hadn’t displayed anything too special. Huo Yuhao could only remember that he had seven soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Yao came before this man in a flash, and she greeted him subtly. The other men suddenly exclaimed and erupted in applause. Somebody was getting lucky today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The guy seemed a little surprised, but a delighted smile quickly appeared on his face. He said nothing at all, but he tapped lightly on the water lily, and he drifted three meters backwards as he made a courteous gesture to invite her onto his water lily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Yao didn’t dally around, and quickly landed on the water lily. She blushed a little as she nodded. The interaction between the two of them was done in complete silence, and the man was hovering in midair similar to the way Hua Yao had a while ago. However, right at this moment, a lotus flower suddenly appeared beneath his feet. The petals bloomed and took the weight of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Yao had mentioned before this that her martial soul was the Lotus.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They exchanged a smile, and there was a feeling as if nothing needed to be said, and everything was embodied in the silence. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inner courtyard’s students didn’t interact much from day to day ,but becoming acquainted was natural. Everyone was too embarrassed to express their feelings on normal days, so the Sea God’s Fate was the best platform to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan smiled and said, “Gu Fan, your little dinghy is about to become a ship!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Fan didn’t talk much, and he bowed slightly in Zhang Lexuan’s direction, but there was no masking the excitement in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan said, “Alright, will the next girl please step up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl with the second number tag was the one Huo Yuhao had been watching this whole time. Huo Yuhao immediately tensed up at Zhang Lexuan’s announcement. This girl was still wearing her bamboo hat! What choice would she make?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman soared into the sky, a layer of golden light enveloping her. Something that stunned everyone happened: she didn’t say a word, nor did she take off her bamboo hat. She just flew directly towards the male students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan couldn’t help but say, “This girl seems a little unfamiliar. Are you not going to remove the bamboo hat and introduce yourself? Don’t forget what I told you earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman shook her head faintly in midair. She still said nothing as she drifted towards the men. She seemed as light as a feather, and flew ten meters before she tapped lightly on the water’s surface and began to fly forward once more. She covered a hundred meters in similar fashion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One yellow, two purple, and three black soul rings appeared. This was a combination that was better than the typical optimal combination of soul rings, and was enough to attract the men. This was especially true since this young lady hadn’t revealed her appearance from the beginning of the event until now, nor had she spoken a single word, making her seem even more mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s fists were clenched tightly. His eyes were unmoving as he stared at the second girl, and he constantly asked himself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Will she choose me? Will she choose me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was coming nearer and nearer. Everyone looked on as she came up before the men, and didn’t pause for a moment as she actually descended towards Huo Yuhao. The golden light suddenly disappeared around her, and she withdrew her soul rings as it seemed she was about to jump into the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t even react in time. The tiny Snow Lady on his shoulders pointed a finger, and fired a dark-blue ray of light onto the water lily. A piece of hardened ice that was a meter in diameter appeared beneath the girl’s feet and took her weight. There was no doubt that Huo Yuhao had the greatest advantage in this segment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” There was a tinge of pleasant surprise in Huo Yuhao’s eyes, but he seemed more hesitant and uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl turned around slightly, and her flowing powdery-blue hair fell in front of her. Her hair flowed down from her shoulders like tidal waves as she let it out from the veil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She still refused to speak, and she didn’t even open her mouth. However, this simple hint made Huo Yuhao shudder violently. His speculation had finally been affirmed. The girl didn’t speak, but perhaps that was because she was embarrassed. She didn’t reveal her appearance, perhaps because she didn’t want to attract the other men. In the end, if she was truly as beautiful as the Goddess of Light, then she would have been the most enchanting and alluring girl in this entire event.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She must be Wang Dong’s sister, Wang Qiu’er!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t hesitate any longer after this. He was no longer the blurred and confused teenager from before, and the warm passion merged with the figure that was imprinted in the deepest parts of his soul. Everyone took the initiative to express their feelings, so how could he have no reaction at all?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao floated up from the water lily and shifted backwards, landing on the water’s surface behind him as he gestured at the girl to say, “Please.” In this moment, his heart’s decision had been made, and whether he would end up with Wang Qiu’er in the end, she had given him a chance, and he would have to try to grasp the opportunity. She was his best buddy’s twin sister, and she had the same appearance as the girl of his dreams! Was there anything more perfect than this? Even if his heart couldn’t completely accept this, out of all the women here today, only this “Wang Qiu’er”, who had yet to reveal her appearance, attracted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young woman jumped forward gently and landed on the water lily before Huo Yuhao. She nodded in his direction, but still said nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water beneath Huo Yuhao’s feet was frozen into ice. He stared at the young girl several meters in front of him, wrapped in a long dress and still wearing her conical bamboo hat. He didn’t know why, but a strong sense of familiarity rose from his heart and made him even more emotional.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why, why does she give me such a strong sense of familiarity?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this sense of familiarity didn’t feel the same as when he had first met Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>

This was especially so after he had obtained the Eye of Destiny, and his senses became even keener.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan smiled and said, “Looks like Huo Yuhao has a lot of chemistry with this mysterious girl! Did you guys arrange this beforehand? We will find out in the final segment! Let’s carry on.”</span></p>

Nobody decided to give up their rights.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao looked up and stared ahead. The blush on her cheeks was still there, and her eyes even had a tinge of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far from her, Wu Ming laughed and said, “Listen to me, Xiao Xiao. Never miss the best opportunity because you feel embarrassed. If you accept a man at the moment he loves you the most, then you will completely capture his heart. He will love you for a lifetime, and he will take even better care of you because he is grateful."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo laughed as well, and said, “Ming’er, seems like you know this quite well. Why haven’t you captured one yet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming seemed rather vexed as she said, “There aren’t any suitable ones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao nodded in their direction, and her embarrassed eyes finally flowed with toughness and determination. “Thank you, senior sisters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She zoomed forward as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her movements were nothing like the women that had gone before her. She flew out, and five soul rings immediately appeared on her body: two yellow, two purple, and one black. There was no question that she was relatively weaker than the other ladies. She was a five-ringed Soul King, and she was undoubtedly unable to levitate and hover in the air without external forces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Xiao Xiao had her own abilities. Just when she was coming to the end of her trajectory, an enormous cauldron appeared beneath her, she landed lightly on it, and paused on top of it. A strange scene occurred immediately afterwards, as she actually vanished along with the huge cauldron, and reappeared thirty meters further along.</span></p>
