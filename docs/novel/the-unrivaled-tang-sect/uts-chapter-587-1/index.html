 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was no longer as weak as he was after he fought ten people. Even if the Death God Demonpuppet stabbed him in the back right now, the aura of death would quickly be dispelled from his body by his twin soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To guide the aura of death into his body, Huo Yuhao had no choice but to control his twin soul cores to circulate soul power at a slower speed. This allowed his soul power to become gentler so that the aura of death could gradually enter and try to corrode his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan observed both of them by one side. When a layer of the aura of death started to surface on Huo Yuhao’s skin, he said, “You can pour your soul power into Wutong and try to communicate with her soul power. While your soul power is different from hers, both of you can fuse your martial souls together. This means that your martial souls are still very compatible. At least she won’t develop resistance. You must try to multitask. On the one hand, you have to try to interact with her soul power. On the other hand, you must try to push your spiritual power into her spiritual sea. Use your Eye of Destiny to release your spiritual power. The point of entry is at the same exact spot on Wutong’s forehead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t make a sound. His Eye of Destiny slowly opened. Rose-gold sunray patterns spread from his forehead as gentle spiritual power surged from his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even with Tai Tan’s cultivation, he was still astonished when Huo Yuhao released his pure spiritual power.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This kid’s abilities have indeed increased greatly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked behind Tang Wutong and lifted her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao carefully controlled his spiritual power, approaching Tang Wutong’s brow with it. He was very aware of what was on her forehead, and where the golden trident pattern was. This pattern rarely appeared. It would only be activated when he touched any part of Tang Wutong’s body with a seal, or if Tang Wutong intentionally activated it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It should be there since Uncle Tai Tan asked me to trigger it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentle spiritual undulations gradually transmitted from Tang Wutong’s brow under the stimulation of Huo Yuhao’s gentle spiritual power. Although these undulations weren’t strong, it felt as if it was resisting any foreign invasion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were already so close to each other, but he could still sense the rejection the seal had towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purely in terms of spiritual power, Huo Yuhao was close to the standard of an Ultimate Douluo. This slight rejection couldn’t affect him. He only continued to use his spiritual power to stimulate that particular spot on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly, Tang Wutong lifted her head on her own. She no longer needed Tai Tan’s help. Dim golden patterns started to appear on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very start, there was only a streak. However, the patterns slowly grew more extensive, and her spiritual undulations also became stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished to discover that these spiritual undulations that Tang Wutong released made him want to submit to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of the strength of their spiritual powers, there was still a pretty large gap. However, this was not important. The more important thing was the mighty and dominant feeling that Tang Wutong’s spiritual power projected. When it interacted with his spiritual power, it was as if it was looking down on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had had such a feeling before, which had even caused a misunderstanding between him and Tang Wutong. It was when he had tried to fuse with Tang Wutong’s martial soul not long after he met her. Back then, he had felt something like this from her soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his cultivation increased, this feeling had slowly disappeared, and eventually vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, this feeling appeared again. The golden trident became more and more apparent under the stimulation of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power. The pressure that Huo Yuhao was under also grew stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Continue to pour out your soul and spiritual power. Don’t stop.” Tai Tan’s voice sounded once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could only maintain the output of his spiritual and soul power. Tai Tan didn’t teach him any secret methods. He only told Huo Yuhao to maintain such a state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao possessed Yin-Yang Complement soul cores. Whether it was the recovery of his soul or spiritual power, he was one of the best in the world right now. Even an Ultimate Douluo might not be comparable to him in this aspect. After all, he was the first person to cultivate Yin-Yang Complement soul cores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was under such a condition that Huo Yuhao was able to maintain his current state. The recovery of his soul and spiritual power was faster than their output. To him, it was not an issue at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he poured in his soul power, the aura of death in her body seemed to be completely forced out. There seemed to be much more of the aura of death seeping into Huo Yuhao’s body. To affect Tang Wutong’s treatment, Huo Yuhao didn’t even dispel the aura of death. He allowed it to circulate within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his body was very sturdy right now. His passageways and organs were all exuding golden light. With his immense soul power and life energy, such external forces couldn’t influence him at all. Everything that the aura of death was trying to do was in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The brightness of the sky gradually faded. As Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny was open, he knew that a day had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After day came night. After night, it was daytime again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, one day and one night had passed. Huo Yuhao was still in his original position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More of his soul power had entered Tang Wutong’s body by now. It entangled itself with her soul power without impacting it. While Tang Wutong’s soul power didn’t fuse with his, it didn’t reject his soul power either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the spiritual level, Tang Wutong’s golden trident shone with blinding golden light as it was stimulated by his spiritual power. As the intense golden light shone, the entire room was illuminated, and the might that the golden trident unleashed even left Huo Yuhao i feeling a little strenuous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a sudden buzz came from Huo Yuhao’s body. After this, a refreshing feeling instantly entered his Eye of Destiny. His rose-gold Eye of Destiny was covered by a layer of icy-blue light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this glow appeared, the might that came from the golden trident suddenly disappeared. It vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was delightfully surprised to discover the presence of this refreshing feeling. Wasn’t it the aura of the Morning Dew Dagger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sigh of the Frozen Goddess, Morning Dew Dagger. It was what he had inherited from the God of Emotions Nian Rongbing. After being subjected to external stimulation, the dagger naturally passed its aura to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t tell me that the aura of the golden trident also belongs to a god? Otherwise, why does it need to be neutralized by the aura of another god?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he could no longer sense the aura of the golden trident, Huo Yuhao was still very confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He started to pour out more spiritual power. The golden trident looked like a real entity right now. Not only was it shining brightly with golden light, but there was even a material feeling to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, summon your spiritual soul core fully. After that, force your spiritual soul core into Wutong’s spiritual sea through the spiritual connection that you’ve built with her, that golden trident.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hesitated a little. He didn’t follow Tai Tan’s instructions immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t easy for him to shift his soul core. A soul core was a soul master’s foundation. Furthermore, stability was key. Once there were problems with one’s soul core, an explosion could happen. Given Huo Yuhao’s abilities, the entire castle might be blown to pieces if his soul core exploded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t even what Huo Yuhao was most worried about. This was because he believed in his control. More importantly, could Tang Wutong withstand it? Could her spiritual sea withstand his soul core? Could his soul core be shifted over through their current spiritual connection?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry. I’m about to use our secret method. Just do what I say. Do you really think I’m going to lie to you?” Tai Tan seemed to have read Huo Yuhao’s thoughts, and immediately responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had no choice right now. He could only believe Tai Tan. He gritted his teeth and started to control his spiritual soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core was a golden whirlpool. At the depths of this whirlpool, there was a subtle golden crystal entity. Right now, his spiritual soul core started to gently shift under his intentional control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual soul core was in his Eye of Destiny. Or rather, it was connected to his Eye of Destiny. When he touched his spiritual soul core, it was immediately projected outwards from his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His bright golden spiritual soul core was revolving tremendously in his Eye of Destiny, but it was very stable. Furthermore, it was slowly becoming clearer and clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rose-gold sunray patterns disappeared, to be replaced by golden radial patterns. Huo Yuhao’s forehead also shone with golden light that was as intense as the golden light that came from Tang Wutong’s golden trident. The entire room was engulfed with immense spiritual undulations. Even the entire castle was covered by a layer of golden light from Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a sea of clouds outside the castle. The clouds that were closest to the castle were illuminated brightly. As golden light spread, the mountain peak that the Clear Sky Castle was on seemed to become an immortal paradise.</span></p>
