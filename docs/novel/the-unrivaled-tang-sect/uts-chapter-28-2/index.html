 <p><strong>Book 4: The Golden Road</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 28.2:&nbsp;Synergic Cooperation, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong Achieve Victory</strong></p>
 <p>Because of that, the agility system Long Xiangyue was struck by Huo Yuhao’s soul skill the instant he threw out his boomerang. The skill he was struck by was one of the four soul skills that came from his first soul ring—Spiritual Interference.</p>
 <p>His Spiritual Interference’s strength was much weaker than his Spiritual Shock’s, so much so that it could practically be disregarded. Even Wang Dong hadn’t sensed that Huo Yuhao had released it. In order to conceal the fact that he’d released an all-new soul skill, Huo Yuhao didn’t allowed Wang Dong to touch him, so that he didn’t use it with their Haodong Power. Instead, he’d made sure to release his Spiritual Interference with his strength alone.</p>
 <p>The interference that occurred for a split second caused a his consciousness become somewhat blurry for a moment, however at that moment, Wang Dong had enveloped him within his wings, thus protecting Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>The boomerang shot through the air, carving a beautiful arc through the air as it flew towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. From the intense light released from the boomerang, as well as the two soul skills that had been added to it, it was obvious that it couldn’t be blocked easily. However, it was still disregarded by the two of them.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong had revealed his strength in the previous match, but the main character in this match was now Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>The instant Long Xiangyue threw out his boomerang, an intense purplish-golden light shot out from Huo Yuhao’s eyes, who was mostly concealed within Wang Dong’s wings.</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen only heard a muffled groan from behind him. Immediately afterwards, the Time Elapsing Clock that had just been released instantly disappeared; Cao Jinxue hadn’t even had the chance to release a soul skill. Under Long Xiangyue’s astonished gaze, Cao Jinxue collapsed to the ground unconscious.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao was able to control the strength of his Haodong Power-boosted Spiritual Shock after his experience with it last time. Thus, Cao Jinxuan only fainted—he wasn’t injured like Ning Tian had been.</p>
 <p>Cao Jinxuan’s martial soul had seemed rather unusual, and he was even a control system soul master. In Huo Yuhao’s opinion, he was the most dangerous of the three. Thus, he hadn’t hesitated to use Haodong Power to instantly take care of him. After all, not every soul master would possess a defensive martial soul as perverted as the Rubberdon. Cao Jinxuan wasn’t an exception to this. Defenseless, he instantly fainted.</p>
 <p>“Pu——” The boomerang struck the ground a foot away from Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. The sharp aura it emanated startled even Wang Dong, and even though he didn’t know what Long Xiangyue’s soul skills were, he was stupified to discover that it’d be extremely difficult to block it without taking any damage if he were to clash with it head-on.</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen glanced backwards and opened his mouth, astonished. He’d clearly been standing in front of Cao Jinxuan, but he’d still been knocked unconscious. Just how had their opponents done it? Naturally, he didn’t know of the existence of something like Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. As long as one was in his detection radius, they wouldn’t be able to hide from him; not even if they flew into the air or hid underground.</p>
 <p>However, as a team leader, Zhou Sichen was able to remain extremely cool-headed. After being startled for a brief moment, he instantly knew that he couldn’t keep guarding himself. Both the Earthen Bear and Devilflame Tiger he’d summoned roared simultaneously before they charged towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>The boomerang that had landed beside the two of them disappeared, then reappeared in Long Xiangyue’s hand.</p>
 <p>This time around, Long Xiangyue became more vigilant and concentrated as he prepared to throw the boomerang again. After covering himself with dense soul power, he threw it.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao only had a single soul ring, and wasn’t willing to expose the fact that he possessed his Spiritual Interference soul skill. However, for him to disrupt a prepared soul master without the assistance of the Haodong Power would be an extremely difficult task. This time around, the boomerang had completely locked onto him.</p>
 <p>This was Zhou Sichen’s original plan. From the understanding they had towards Huo Yuhao’s team, they were able to faintly guess towards the importance of this one-ringed soul master. Thus, he’d wanted Long Xiangyue to go all-out and take care of Huo Yuhao before they did anything else. As long as the referee sensed that Huo Yuhao wouldn’t be able to take his blow, he’d directly remove Huo Yuhao from the match. After that, they could join forces to fight against Wang Dong, which would practically be a definite win for them.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao completely ignored his boomerang. Under the strength-amplifying abilities of the Haodong Power, the purplish-golden light shot out from Huo Yuhao’s eyes again, this time towards Zhou Sichen.</p>
 <p>After Cao Jinxuan’s sudden fainting, how could Zhou Sichen not be careful? He’d done the same thing as Long Xiangyue; he circulated his soul power around his entire body, especially his brain. He did all of this just to protect himself from Huo Yuhao’s spiritual-type soul skill.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, he was fighting against a skill powered by Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s combined efforts. How could his Spiritual Shock—equivalent to an attack from a Soul Elder—be so easily defended against?</p>
 <p>The instant that purplish-golden light shot out from Huo Yuhao’s eyes, Zhou Sichen’s head suddenly rocked backwards, as if he’d suffered a heavy blow. Immediately afterwards, his body followed suit.</p>
 <p>From his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao was able to tell that he’d guarded himself against spiritual-type attacks. Because of that, his Spiritual Shock this time was at full power.</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen knew what his opponent was intending to do, yet he’d still been unable to do anything about it. However, the defense of an assault system soul master was relatively strong, and although the attack was able to knock him down, he hadn’t yet fainted. He had, however, lost control of the two soul skills his Treasure Bible had released, resulting in the two beasts suddenly stopping in the middle of their charge towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>The instant he released his second Spiritual Shock, Huo Yuhao shouted, “Teacher, save me!”</p>
 <p>The boomerang had already crossed half the distance between Long Xiangyue and Huo Yuhao, and it was just about to reach Huo Yuhao. However, Wang Dong didn’t protect him; he unfurled his wings instead. An intense, golden light began to appear on his dazzling blue wings. This was his second soul skill, the Light of the Butterfly Goddess. At that exact moment, the Haodong Power that had originally been in Huo Yuhao’s body, rushed into Wang Dong’s body, rapidly filling it up.</p>
 <p>When he heard Huo Yuhao’s cry of help, the proctor naturally couldn’t simply ignore him. When a student cried out for help during the freshmen assessment, it signified that he’d given up and would no longer attack.</p>
 <p>A black figure flashed, and the boomerang appeared in the hands of the proctor. Nobody saw the proctor release his soul power or a soul skill, yet the light from the boomerang had already vanished.</p>
 <p>At that exact moment, Wang Dong released his Light of the Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>Right. After crying out for help, Huo Yuhao hadn’t even attempted to defend himself, so much so that he’d even withdrawn his martial soul, causing the single white ring around his body to disappear. Nobody could claim that he was breaking the rules, but in reality, he’d transferred all of the Haodong Power they’d created to Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>Immediately afterwards, the orange tinted golden light devastated the entire arena.</p>
 <p>The referee, who’d just caught the boomerang, had no choice but to make a move yet again. He released an enormous umbrella, which instantly expanded outwards. Only then was he able to block Wang Dong’s Light of the Butterfly Goddess, which was a bombarding attack that lasted for three seconds. He knew that both the collapsed Zhou Sichen and Cao Jinxue, along with Long Xiangyue—who’d just released his boomerang—were simply unable to block Wang Dong’s attack.</p>
 <p>Team Huo Yuhao had won yet again, allowing them to advance to the finals.</p>
