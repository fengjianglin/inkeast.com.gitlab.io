 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There have to be powerful soul masters here, since there are so many soldiers standing guard. The Holy Ghost Church probably has men here too. I’ll take a look once I’m back from the Setting Sun Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around and went straight for the Setting Sun Forest. He couldn’t help but wonder how Princess Wei Na and the others from the Body Sect were doing as he flew. The last time they had met at Radiant City, they were still so powerful, but they were now citizens who had lost their country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Setting Sun Forest was very close to Heaven Dou City, and Huo Yuhao could soon see the dense forest from a distance. There were faint flickers of brilliant colors deep in the forest. Of course, they were fatal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful, Little Bai. This forest has a very toxic miasma inside,” Huo Yuhao warned the Ice Bear King beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King chuckled and said, “Rest assured, grandfather. Poison is what I’m least afraid of. Besides poisons like that belonging to the Ice Empress, the soul beasts of the Extreme North rely on our extremely low temperatures to resist most kinds of strong poisons. It’s all good… let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s true. My Ultimate Ice isn’t afraid of poison, and the Ice Bear King is much stronger than I am. The Snow Empress has truly found a good helper for me, and everything is a lot safer with this fellow around.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the reason why Huo Yuhao felt confident investigating Heaven Dou City earlier that day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took the Ice Bear King into the Setting Sun Forest, and went down the same familiar path as the Ice Bear King followed beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very different from when he first came here long ago. He was still extremely weak back then, and didn’t understand anything about what was happening here. Now, he was a formidable Soul Sage, and almost a Soul Douluo. His soul power had been increasing rapidly, even exponentially, after continuously absorbing the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence every day over the past few days. Huo Yuhao could even feel that he was close to that bottleneck, and the discovery actually surprised him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s soul power was only at Rank 74 when he left Shrek City. A little more than a month had gone by, but he could already feel that he was pushing towards the next bottleneck. This cultivation speed was simply too quick!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, one of the most important reasons was that he had absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, and the Snow Empress was there to guide him. By forming his soul core, his soul power cultivation speed was greatly increased. His soul core continuously helped him increase his soul power even when he was not cultivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Icefire Yin Yang Well quickly came into view. Huo Yuhao unleashed his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice to expel the miasma as he took Little Bai into the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A man and a bear descended from the sky right into the valley. However, Huo Yuhao was immediately taken aback when they entered the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Icefire Yin Yang Well was still a paradise on earth the last time he was here, but many things were different now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many different plants growing densely inside the valley around the Icefire Yin Yang Well, but everything clearly looked a lot more chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many plants on the periphery had disappeared, and some areas even revealed empty earth. Only the immortal herbs and plants in the inner circles appeared as they were. Furthermore, such a place that was filled with life did seem a little disarrayed. Some of the immortal herbs in the inner circle seemed like they had shifted around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What happened? Did someone come inside?,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wondered as he walked towards the Icefire Yin Yang Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re here.” He wasn’t even near the Icefire Yin Yang Well when a crying voice rang out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King was startled as he turned around vigilantly. He could see a large pinkish flower that was swaying its head around, and it was clearly emanating grievous emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How are you, You You?” The large pinkish flower was the Delicate Silk Immortal, and Huo Yuhao hurriedly greeted her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Delicate Silk Immortal was clearly full of resentment. “No, I’m not good at all. Ever since you guys sent in those two bastards, our plants haven’t been well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Huo Yuhao was momentarily stunned. Only then did he realize that the mess around the Icefire Yin Yang Well was related to Big Mao and Second Mao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s wrong, You You? Have Big Mao and Second Mao caused you trouble?” Huo Yuhao asked a little anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They have caused more than trouble!” The Delicate Silk Immortal answered sorrowfully, “If not for the fact that some of us still have some strength, we would probably have become meals in their bellies. They’re not bears, they’re two pigs! Look at the outer layers. Originally, there were all kinds of herbs and plants there that were thousands of years old, but they have eaten them all. They are also very cunning, and have considered eating us more than once. We didn’t dare to kill them because of you. The home that we have relied on for subsistence has become so tattered. If you didn’t come, we might have risked everything we have to deal with them, and that’s because they have become far too powerful. If we don’t deal with them soon, they might just eat every single one of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t expect Big Mao and Second Mao to cause so much trouble. He hurriedly apologized, “Sorry, sorry. I didn’t know they would be like that. I’m here to take them away this time, don’t you worry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You You heaved a sigh of relief, and many immortal herbs and plants released similar emotions around them. They had to be wary of those two fellows eating them every day, and living a life like that was truly difficult!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King didn’t pay attention to Huo Yuhao and You You’s conversation. Instead, his attention was focused on the Extreme Chill Icespring. He exclaimed happily, “Eh, this place seems very fun! That water is interesting!” as he spoke, and he strode towards it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was caught off-guard as Little Bai leapt into the air and went right down towards the Extreme Chill Icespring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Delicate Silk Immortal’s voice froze, and was clearly a little stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this human retarded? Why is he jumping straight into the Icespring?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is your friend committing suicide, Huo Yuhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about him. He’ll be fine,” Huo Yuhao said in exasperation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King plopped right into the Extreme Chill Icepsring, and quickly disappeared into the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You You, where are Big Mao and Second Mao? Let me take them away,” Huo Yuhao asked the Delicate Silk Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Delicate Silk Immortal’s enormous flowerhead gestured to one side and said, “They’re over there. Those two fellows are either eating or sleeping to digest some herbs. They are fast asleep. Their digestive abilities are too strong. They eat every day and digest every day, and they absorb everything especially quickly. Go take a look. Take them away as fast you can… we can’t stand them for a minute longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, alright. Calm down. I’ll just take them away.” Huo Yuhao felt very guilty that Big Mao and Second Mao had caused so much harm to them. This place was a place that the Tang Sect’s ancestor, Tang San, had been to before, after all. He couldn’t just let this place be ruined!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He swiftly went in the direction that You You had pointed out, and the herbs and plants opened a path for him as they let him walk as he liked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big Mao and Second Mao were lying down in the outer layer. There were quite a few plants and herbs beside them, and there was even some residue around the corners of Big Mao’s mouth. Criminals wouldn’t want to be caught, but these two fellows didn’t care at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished when he saw them. These two fellows were changing far too quickly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s appetite was incredible, and Huo Yuhao had already known that when they were still in the Tang Sect. The food that they had to gather to feed them was equivalent to the volume that everyone in the Tang Sect ate every day. However, they were less than three meters tall when they left the Tang Sect. Less than a year had gone by, but Big Mao and Second Mao were at least seven meters tall now. Even though they were still quite a distance away from becoming fully-grown Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears, their growth was just too quick. Their current size and build meant they were at least Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears with a thousand years of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s strength couldn’t be measured by the number of cultivating years that normal soul beasts were measured by. Thousand-year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears were feared by even ten-thousand-year soul beasts, just like the first Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear that Huo Yuhao had encountered back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seems like they’ve been causing too much destruction, but they are growing very quickly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know that back when Bei Bei sent Big Mao and Second Mao into this place, You You and the other immortal herbs had allowed them to stay because of Huo Yuhao. That was because the valley where the Icefire Yin Yang Well was located was very large, and all sorts of herbs such as ginseng and huangqi could be seen everywhere. They were all very nutritious and beneficial herbs. From the immortal herbs’ perspective, those two bears could eat for a few hundred years, and they still wouldn’t finish eating those things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But what they didn’t know was that the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears’ appetite couldn’t be judged from their size. They possessed far stronger digestive abilities than normal living beings, and they had eaten nonstop ever since they had arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were still eating normal food back at the Tang Sect, and they digested normal food normally. Even though they still ate a lot back then, their appetite wasn’t that outrageous. But the herbs and plants in this place were considered rare and exotic herbs, and every single species took their form from condensing large amounts of the spiritual qi of heaven and earth. The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears were very good at absorbing the spiritual qi of heaven and earth. Big Mao and Second Mao would eat gluttonously every day. Then they would sleep, and digest everything as they slept before eating gluttonously again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Humans would have exploded from the large amounts of nutrients if they ate so many herbs every day. However, the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s were enormous, and had a frightening capacity to absorb all the vital energies of heaven and earth. They ate quickly, and digested quickly as well, ending up with things like this.</span></p>
