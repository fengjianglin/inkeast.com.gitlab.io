He shut his eyes and didn’t speak further. Ju Zi felt a chill run down her spine. He wasn’t being generous! It was only because Jing Hongchen and his Illustrious Virtue Hall were still useful, and thus Xu Tianran wasn’t willing to offend him, so he tolerated the defeat. Xu Tianran was too scary…</span></p>

He also recounted how he was able to unleash the Dragon Roar of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing his recounting of events, Wang Dong’er was in a daze. It was too much of a coincidence. Not only did Wang Qiu’er look identical to her, but she could also form a fusion skill with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmph!” Wang Dong’er snorted furiously and jumped off from the bed.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An amused look flashed across Wang Dong’er’s eyes, but she placed her hands on her hips before furiously saying, “Do you know why you were in the wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was clever. “I know. I shouldn’t have kept the truth from you. I was only afraid that you’d misunderstand, that’s why I didn’t tell you anything. However, my Dong’er is such a magnanimous person. Why would she be bothered about something as trivial as this? I’m the coward who made you angry. I’m in the wrong. I understand my mistake now. Dong’er, forgive me. Don’t worry, my heart is only for you. Honestly speaking, I also felt very weird when I found out I could form a martial soul fusion skill with her. I was even more curious about her background. However, I’m still unable to see anything. I can only feel that she doesn’t have any ill intentions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er laughed coldly. “Of course she doesn’t have any ill intentions. She only has love for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He promptly broke out coughing at her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er thought for a moment before saying, “To prevent you from ‘committing an offense’, I’ll forbid you from interacting with Wang Qiu’er alone. If there’s anything you want to talk to her about, I must be by your side. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Your Majesty,” Huo Yuhao quickly agreed with a sincere look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er returned to the bed and sat beside him. “Yuhao, you must know that I’m not jealous. It’s just that your body isn’t in good shape, but you are still working so hard. It’s better to be involved in fewer matters. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, you’re right. You’re right.” He could only agree with her now.</span></p>

However, I’m hurt because you’ve been lying to me for so long. Your punishment will be that you’ll continue to sleep alone on the bed. I’ll sleep on the sofa.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 32pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, go and cultivate. You still need to compete in the round of six in the soul engineering tournament tonight. I’m afraid your opponent will be difficult to deal with. How’s your injury?” Wang Dong’er stopped joking and asked worriedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “Don’t worry, my body is different from a normal person’s. With the immense life power of the Life Gold, this injury is nothing. I’ll be able to recover by tonight. Protect me. I’ll start cultivating now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Shrek Academy had won the match today, Huo Yuhao seemed to feel more inhibited. He felt that the tournament was getting more and more complex. However, there weren’t any clues on the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Starlight Sapphire ring on his right hand shone, and a porcelain jug appeared in his hand. It contained the distillate that he had bought from the bar the other day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er retreated to a sofa at the side, watching him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he opened the jug, a strong alcoholic smell drifted out. The distillate was very strong, and had not been blended yet. An ordinary person would be drunk after two sips of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dim icy fog spread out from Huo Yuhao’s body. He placed the jug to one side and quickly stripped, revealing his muscles. The surface of his skin was already covered with icy fog. The image of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion surfaced behind his back. It was a sign that he had unleashed his second martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He grabbed the jug again and quickly swallowed the distillate as if he were a whale. Every time he stopped to breathe, his skin would shine with a dim red glow. It was a stark contrast to the icy fog around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly circulated his soul power, and a dim golden glow appeared. His immense spiritual power enabled him to accurately circulate his soul power, and under that precise control, his soul power started to initiate the catalytic effects of the distillate. He circulated his soul power according to the method of the Mysterious Heaven Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of azure light flashed past his brow. A small yet shiny and transparent azure-green carving blade flew out. It surrounded Huo Yuhao’s body and drifted above his head after making a circuit around him. A green aura descended and fused with Huo Yuhao’s body. It was the Life Guardian’s Blade!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the strong life power of the blade and the catalytic effects of the distillate, Huo Yuhao started to fuse with the origin energy of Ultimate Ice at a much faster rate. Although he wasn’t able to move, his soul power was increasing at a faster rate than before. In addition, the speed at which he absorbed the origin energy increased as his soul power grew. His confidence in his cultivation also grew as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er seemed to be immersed in her thoughts as she looked at Huo Yuhao. She revealed a slight smile on her face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s really getting stronger and stronger. Ah, Wang Qiu’er, you are really a huge headache! She’s also so nice to him. I must watch this fool properly…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou lowered his voice and asked, “Yuhao, our opponents tonight won’t be easy to deal with. Must we win or…?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “Second senior, you are Tang Si and I’m Tang Wu now. You should call me second brother. We can’t make any mistakes now. We must win tonight! Use some of your true abilities. The rare metals that we can potentially win tonight can’t be bought with money, and the Tang Sect needs them. After we reach the round of three, we can compete against the other two underground organizations. It’s a pity that we can’t bet with rare metals or it would be even better. Let’s make a huge wager tonight, and win more money first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already amassed more than twenty million gold soul coins after winning his previous rounds. The amount of money he had was enough to equip an army of ten thousand soldiers. However, twenty million gold soul coins was nothing in the world of soul engineers. Soul engineering was a profession that burned a lot of money. Creating a successful soul tool was very lucrative, but how many soul engineers had a close to hundred percent success rate like Huo Yuhao? That was why some strong soul engineers often created soul tools of lower classes to exchange for money to sustain their daily expenses. It was also why soul engineering sects were very cautious when they accepted disciples, and why the Illustrious Virtue Hall was so respected. Without the support of an empire, there wasn’t any way soul engineers who engaged in elite and advanced research could survive!</span></p>

As Huo Yuhao and He Caitou advanced further and further in the tournament, his attitude was becoming ever more respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young Tang masters, quick. Let’s enter.” Chen An immediately went up to receive Huo Yuhao as soon as he saw him, a fawning look on his face.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second master, we’ve not started the lot drawing. You…” Chen An roughly knew how many gold soul coins Huo Yuhao had. He was a little hesitant, as it would be quite a huge bet. Even the most distinguished guests in the Golden Hall didn’t bet so much. Furthermore, he didn’t even know his opponent yet, and the last six competitors left were all very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “No worries. If I didn’t even have this little confidence, I wouldn’t be here at all. You can use it to bet. I’m confident.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Chen An acknowledged his words respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We don’t have to rush to enter. How’s the matter I asked you to settle?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An appeared to be in a spot and said, “It’s indeed a little difficult to buy rare metals now. Although we have some channels to purchase rare metals, you must know that the three underground organizations are organizing their own tournament. Rare metals are being used in great amounts in these tournaments, and a huge batch of them is being used as rewards for the participating soul engineers. The control on rare metals has become very strict, so…”</span></p>

Don’t bother explaining it to me. I only want to see the results. If you do this well, I’ll promote you from Class 5 to Class 6, and from five rings to six rings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Chen An was stunned after hearing his words. He seemed a little doubtful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? Don’t you believe me?” Huo Yuhao glanced at him coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I believe, I believe!” Chen An hurriedly nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Although I’m a domineering person, I’m never stingy towards those who help me. Give me your hand. I’ll let you feel it for a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen An was dazed for a moment, and extended his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used three fingers to feel his pulse. Suddenly, Chen An felt a wave of pure soul power transferring into his body from Huo Yuhao’s fingertip. This wave of soul power wasn’t very strong, but it was extremely pure. There didn’t even seem to be any elements present, but it contained vibrant life power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Chen An felt the pores on his body opening up. His blood was surging, and he instantly felt much younger. He was even more astonished to realize that his soul power was undulating rapidly after the pure soul power entered his body. He could feel his own soul power being enhanced, it was too obvious. In addition, he didn’t sense any evil aura from it!</span></p>
