 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe seemed a little stunned. “Yuhao? He’s back? I didn’t know that! He left the academy not too long ago to go to the Sun Moon Empire for a mission, and I haven’t seen him since.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er was standing behind him, and she rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This guy can just spout bullshit so naturally. To think that he’s already at Rank 97.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bullshit. I clearly felt his aura inside Shrek City,” Di Tian’s eyes flickered coldly, “Don’t try to smoke me, Yan Shaozhe. You have sixty seconds to hand him over. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not being polite.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And how are you going to be impolite, Beast God?” An elderly voice rang out as a beam of yellow light surged into the sky. This formidable aura crushed the pressure that the Di Tian had laid out in the sky. This yellow beam of light arrived in front of Di Tian in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Di Tian stared at Elder Xuan, who had just appeared in front of him, and he was astonished yet again. He was already surprised at how Yan Shaozhe had improved, but he wasn’t concerned about someone who was only at Rank 97. But Elder Xuan was different, and he could clearly feel Elder Xuan’s second soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That wasn’t something that just any living being could have. It was a true second soul core, one that reflected an Ultimate Douluo’s strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many transcendent soul beasts who had several hundred thousand years of cultivation, who had the strength to rival a human Ultimate Douluo, and their total soul power volume could definitely match up. But their chances of victory in an actual battle against an Ultimate Douluo were comparatively low, and the reason was because an Ultimate Douluo possessed a second soul core. It was incredibly hard for soul beasts to form their second soul core, since they could only achieve that through the Yin Yang Complement method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only two among the Ten Great Savage Beasts who had truly completed their second soul cores were the Beast God and the Evileye Tyrant King. That was the reason why the Evileye Tyrant King had dared to challenge him back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, savage beasts would become incredibly powerful after forming their second soul core. Di Tian even believed that all the Ultimate Douluo in the world would be no match for him, even if they gathered together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;However, Di Tian deeply understood how formidable Ultimate Douluos were, even though he had such an opinion. He was strong enough to defeat an Ultimate Douluo, but he would also have to pay a price if he wanted to kill that Ultimate Douluo. Therefore, he was greatly surprised when he felt that Elder Xuan had become an Ultimate Douluo. He was clear that Elder Xuan had been stuck at Rank 98 for many years, and with a human’s natural physique, it was almost impossible for him to continue moving forward. And yet, he had done it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian muttered coldly, “Xuan Zi, do you really think that you can fight me just because you’ve become an Ultimate Douluo?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan stared back coldly. “There is only one way to find out. Shrek and the Great Star Dou Forest have been at peace over the past few years, and we have tried to promote the Spirit Pagoda as much as possible. We have greatly reduced the hunting and killing of soul beasts inside your Great Star Dou Forest throughout the process. I don’t know what it is that you want today, but do you really think that you can get away with provoking Shrek like this? Di Tian, if you don’t give me an explanation today, we will not let you go in peace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan dominated reason, and the first thing he did when he arrived was to seize the initiative. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s eyes flickered faintly. The truth was that the Great Star Dou Forest and Shrek were actually in a honeymoon period over the past few years. Both sides cooperated well, and there were much fewer deaths inside the Great Star Dou Forest. That was especially so after Huo Yuhao, Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, and the others swore inside that Spirit Pagoda that they would never hurt another soul beast. That made Bi Ji, the Emerald Swan, extremely touched. That also pulled their relationship even closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, he had come forward brashly to ask for Huo Yuhao because the changes he had felt in his body were quite uncalled for and unreasonable. Di Tian didn’t really know what to say after Elder Xuan chided him fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peace between both parties was very beneficial. Di Tian wanted to pluck Huo Yuhao from Shrek City, but doing so would undoubtedly affect the peaceful outlook that they had established over the past few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But how could he let this go if he didn’t find Huo Yuhao? He desperately wanted to know what had happened to Huo Yuhao, and the reason why he couldn’t even feel his reverse scale’s aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xuan Zi, the reason why I’m here today is because there are some things I wish to ask Huo Yuhao. I’m not trying to provoke or antagonize Shrek. Call him out, and I’ll leave after asking him a few questions.” Di Tian was formidable, but he had his scruples and concerns. His largest one was his kin inside the Great Star Dou Forest, and his tone softened a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan heaved a sigh and said, “Beast God, Yuhao is heavily injured because he had to fight a formidable enemy. He’s barely breathing at the moment because he has suffered some kind of powerful attack. If you are really concerned about him, then you should help us fight against this formidable enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s been hurt by a formidable enemy?” Di Tian did believe part of what Elder Xuan had said. Certain incredibly powerful attacks such as the one he had witnessed from the Death God Douluo’s Death God Pagoda could possibly temporarily disable his reverse scale. If that was what had happened, then everything could be explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian would never help humans resolve their own battles. However, the Great Star Dou Forest could be considered in some sense to be Shrek Academy’s ally. The Great Star Dou Forest pretending they didn’t know and not showing up was one thing, but Di Tian couldn’t really say no if he was told in public.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian hesitated before he said, “Shrek has ten thousand years of foundations. How can Shrek have any problems dealing with such small and weak enemies? We’ll talk about all that afterwards; let me take a look at him first. I will find a way to treat him if his injuries are overly severe. You have to understand that I, too, do not wish him dead. He possesses the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s power of destiny after all. Take me to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan cussed in his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s hard to trick him after all because of his experience. Di Tian is such a tough nut to crack.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;How could he take Di Tian to see Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan naturally understood that the Beast God’s sudden appearance had something to do with Huo Yuhao breaking through and creating his second soul core. Even though he didn’t know how the Beast God could sense that, this was the only viable explanation. Di Tian’s arrival at this time also proved one thing, and that was the fact that Huo Yuhao was just about to succeed. Elder Xuan couldn’t let Di Tian disturb Huo Yuhao at such an important time, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan heaved a faint sigh, and he shook his head exasperatedly yet resolutely. “I’m afraid I can’t do that, Beast God. We have already treated Yuhao’s injuries, and he’s resting at the moment. Our doctors have specifically instructed that nobody is to disturb him. Why don’t we do it this way: you can stay in the academy for now, and I’ll take you to him once he’s a little better.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” The Beast God’s eyes flickered, as he could tell that something wasn’t right. He grunted coldly and said, “You’re trying to buy time, Xuan Zi. Get him out here or take me to him. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not being polite. I have been alive for several hundred thousand years, and I have seen too much of humanity’s trickery. You’re dreaming if you think you can lie to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s expression changed as he lowered his voice and said, “Beast God, are you trying to violate our pact and antagonize us humans?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God’s face turned black. He did just want to see Huo Yuhao’s situation, and he didn’t want to affect what both parties shared through the Spirit Pagoda. That arrangement was beneficial for the entire Great Star Dou Forest, after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God hesitated for a moment before he made up his mind. The power of destiny was more important, because that was an important guarantee for his breakthrough during his next bottleneck. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t make me repeat myself, Xuan Zi. My patience has its limits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s heart sank as he stared at the Beast God’s ice-cold eyes. He knew that he no longer had any wiggle room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, since you have no sympathy for our situation, then come. You have to defeat me if you wish to disturb Yuhao’s recovery.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s eyes sparkled. He wasn’t angry, but his majesty was evident as his flowing black hair drifted in the wind. “Are you challenging me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan laughed and answered, “I haven’t found a suitable enemy to test my abilities after becoming an Ultimate Douluo. Since the Beast God is here today, then I have a perfect opportunity to test how far I am from the Continent’s most powerful individual.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very well. I won’t go overboard. I will leave if you can hold off my onslaught for one hour. On the other hand, if you can’t, I will not hurt anybody residing in Shrek City, and you’ll take me to see Huo Yuhao. We won’t affect our cooperation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s eyes sparkled. “We’ll talk about that after our fight.” He surged higher into the sky as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian didn’t move at all. Black shadows flashed as he reached an even higher altitude, and waited quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe, Xian Lin’er and the others didn’t follow them. Instead, they retreated further away. They weren’t powerful enough to affect a battle at an Ultimate Douluo’s level, but watching and gaining revelations from this battle would be beneficial for their future advancement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two silhouettes continued climbing through the air before they stopped at about five thousand meters from the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul rings emerged from Elder Xuan’s body one after another, and his heavy and solemn aura immediately tainted the entire sky yellow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian hovered proudly in midair and quietly observed Elder Xuan’s soul power undulations. A contemptuous expression appeared from the corner of his mouth as he said, “Xuan Zi, you still only possess a human’s Resonance soul core. Even though I don’t know how you’ve managed this, you should understand that you don’t have much of a chance against me.”</span></p>
