 <p><strong>Book 6: Graduating</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 35.1: I Haven't Lost Yet!</strong></p>
 <p>At this moment, Huo Yuhao had no intentions of going easy on Wu Feng. His palms became jade in colour as he unleashed Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon on Wu Feng.</p>
 <p>With a “bang”, Wu Feng was shoved more than five meters away from Huo Yuhao. This time around, she couldn’t maintain her balance. As a result of this, Wu Feng fell down and rolled on the ground.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s cultivation wasn’t as high as Wu Feng’s, but he was still someone with Rank 17 soul power; he was a true soul master. His all-out Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon and Mysterious Jade Palm had still been relatively heavy blows.</p>
 <p>Wu Feng couldn’t help but shake slightly as she got up. With an “ah” she spat out a mouthful of blood. She’d clearly been injured.</p>
 <p>The students standing in the spectator’s stage were all left flabbergasted.</p>
 <p>Before the match, who would’ve predicted an outcome like this? Who could have!?</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had actually managed to gain the upper hand! Beneath his relentless attacks, Wu Feng hadn’t even had a chance to counterattack.</p>
 <p>Both Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu were astonished, Xiao Xiao’s eyes had widened in surprise, and Zhou Sichen was chewing on his finger nervously. The only exception to all of this was Cao Jinxuan, who was currently staring at Huo Yuhao with sparkling eyes.</p>
 <p>From their outer appearances, it seemed like both sides hadn’t used any soul skills yet. Yet somehow, an assault-type soul master had actually lost to a control-type soul master in hand-to-hand combat! Furthermore, this was with such a disparity in cultivation between the two.</p>
 <p>Wu Feng, who had the Red Dragon martial soul, was definitely much stronger than Huo Yuhao in terms of physique alone. Her speed, power, and flexibility were all greater than Huo Yuhao’s; what had happened?</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter that she’d been kicked in the bum, yet Huo Yuhao’s palms had sent her flying and forced her to cough up blood. Her defense had been strengthened considerably under the effects of her Red Dragon martial soul, yet she’d actually been forced to cough up some blood. Since when did Huo Yuhao have the ability to do something like this?</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao basically hadn’t participated in any direct confrontations throughout the entire freshmen assessment, except for the time that he’d used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track against Dai Huabin’s team. Because of that, his hand-to-hand abilities had been entirely overlooked. Only now did everyone realise how wrong they’d been about him. This was especially so for those that weren’t at the two-ringed rank yet. They couldn’t help but ask themselves: if they were to fight against Huo Yuhao in a close-combat fight, could they win? Had Wu Feng’s loss truly been due to carelessness alone?</p>
 <p>Wang Dong couldn’t help but stare blankly. He’d thought of many ways for Huo Yuhao to stave off Wu Feng, but he’d never considered the possibility of hand-to-hand combat. Huo Yuhao had actually decided to use his own weakness against his opponent’s strong point… yet he was winning?</p>
 <p>The most astonished person present was Wu Feng herself. She hadn’t expected Huo Yuhao to fight her like this, not even in her wildest dreams. The Spiritual Shock she’d been constantly wary off hadn’t come either, yet she’d suffered a huge loss in a close-combat fight.</p>
 <p>She also felt a burning pain coming from her back. Huo Yuhao’s palms were like two chunks of metal when they’d viciously smashed into her back. Furthermore, she’d felt two gentle forces surge through her body as soon as his palms hit her. These forces that had seeped into her body could be described as ‘gentle’, but they had seeped directly into her internal organs. Unexpectedly, Wu Feng wasn’t able to remove them in a short period of time, even with her tyrannical soul power. Thus, she had had no choice but to cough up a mouthful of blood in order to slow down the progression of her injuries. However, her internal organs had still been badly shaken.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s kick hadn’t hurt that much, as there was a large amount of flesh on her bum. However, this had been done in front of the entirety of Class 1! Furthermore, a man had never touched her buttocks before. And, as soon as he’d kicked her, a strange feeling had begun to spread throughout her buttocks; this was the main reason that she’d stumbled after getting up.</p>
 <p>“Bastard, I’m going to kill you!” Wu Feng roared angrily, then pounced towards Huo Yuhao like an enraged lioness. This time around, she didn’t hold anything back. She instantly activated her first soul skill, Dragonfire.</p>
 <p>The person who had the strongest self-augmenting soul skill amongst Class 1’s assault-type soul masters was definitely Dai Huabin and his White Tiger Vajra Transformation. However, Wu Feng was the strongest person after Dai Huabin. Her Dragonfire and Dragonfury had extremely strong self-augmenting abilities in addition to the increase in attack power they gave her. Because of this, Wu Feng was definitely an expert in close-quarters combat. If Dai Huabin didn’t use his third soul skill, the two of them would definitely end up locked in a stalemate during a close-combat fight. And yet, she’d just suffered a loss to Huo Yuhao, and it hadn’t been a small loss either!</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao continued to keep his eyes shut, but his expression became serious. He’d been able to injure Wu Feng in their close combat fight by catching her unaware and using of the Tang Sect’s secret techniques in addition to his Spiritual Detection’s foresight. At the same time, it was also because Wu Feng hadn’t used any of her soul skills yet.</p>
 <p>Wu Feng’s burning Dragonfire instantly scorched everything within a foot of her. Because of this, the scorching stream of air struck Huo Yuhao in the face before she’d even arrived. Huo Yuhao was a spiritual-type soul master, thus his Spirit Eyes weren’t able to strengthen his body in any way. He could predict all of her moves, but he wasn’t able to break through Wu Feng’s defensive soul skills!</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao didn’t choose to retreat. He knew that he hadn’t had much of a chance in the first place, and that being able to take advantage of his opponent’s lack of awareness was already an extremely good result for him.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao didn’t want to admit defeat. Even if he only had a sliver of hope left, he didn’t want to give up.</p>
 <p>As such, Huo Yuhao chose not to retreat. As he withstood the high temperatures that were assaulting him, he used his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track to rush towards Wu Feng.</p>
 <p>This time around, Wu Feng didn’t choose to jump into the air. Instead, she rushed towards Huo Yuhao on foot. The moment that Wu Feng was close enough to strike Huo Yuhao, she stopped and sent her left hand towards Huo Yuhao’s stomach while firmly balanced.</p>
 <p>As a core disciple, even though Wu Feng had a fiery disposition, she definitely wasn’t an impulsive person. After suffering a loss to Huo Yuhao, she’d definitely pay attention to his attacks.</p>
 <p>Facing Wu Feng’s palm strike, Huo Yuhao suddenly leaned to the left and dodged her attack. Making sure not to enter the one-foot area around Wu Feng, he crouched down and side-stepped to her right side.</p>
 <p>Like a bolt of lightning, Wu Feng sent a kick flying straight towards Huo Yuhao with her right leg. Her kicking speed was extremely fast, and her leg reached Huo Yuhao’s chest in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, Huo Yuhao unexpectedly slipped. He seemed to fall down, as if he’d lost control of his body. Wu Feng’s kick brushed past his chest as if it were stuck to it, instantly charring the front of Huo Yuhao’s shirt. At the same time, the scorching hot temperatures from Wu Feng’s Dragonfire enveloped his body.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection wasn’t omnipotent, as his physical speed couldn’t follow the speed of his thoughts. He’d used up the of his energy in order to dodge Wu Feng’s last attack.</p>
