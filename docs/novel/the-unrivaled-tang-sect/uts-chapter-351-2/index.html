These rewards were one of his most important goals in this tournament!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, sir. If there’s nothing else, we’ll take our leave.” Huo Yuhao was still inside his human-shaped soul tool at this moment. He raised his metal leg and was about to walk away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait.” The vice-founder raised her hand, and blocked Huo Yuhao and He Caitou’s path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao muttered plainly, “What’s up? We’ve helped you clinch the championship. Are you still not letting us go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder smiled faintly and said, “Of course not, but there are some things that I wish to discuss with you. Judging from your abilities, you seem like an evil soul master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t respond directly. “What does that have to do with you guys?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder didn’t react emotionally at all because of Huo Yuhao’s cold attitude. She continued amicably, “Of course that has something to do with us... because we are the same.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An aura that instilled intense fear into Huo Yuhao and He Caitou’s hearts instantly rose from her body as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Greyish-blue light expanded from behind her back, and an exceedingly sharp and shrill howl could be heard. The greyish-blue light surged into the sky and condensed into a phoenix, while that eerie evil aura painted the sky above the competition stage greyish-blue with incredible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a mighty aura of evil!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how powerful Huo Yuhao and He Caitou were, they felt their entire bodies turn cold and stiff as they sensed the aura that emanated from the vice-founder’s body. It was like their spirits had been locked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Evil Phoenix! That was actually the Evil Phoenix! It was a formidable martial soul that was almost considered Ultimate Evil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder was undoubtedly a Transcendent Douluo, and she was possibly higher than Rank 95!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four elders behind her took a few steps back, their faces overcome with respect and admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder’s voice was very warm and gentle. “Look, we’re one and the same. Even though I can’t tell what your evil martial soul is, you can have everything you want if you join us.” There was a peculiar charm in her voice, and her voice made Huo Yuhao feel as if his heart was pounding out of his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can use the power of light to unleash your abilities as an evil soul master, and I am a big fan of your necromantic summoning abilities. You are the Holy Son that my Church has been looking for, and we are very delighted that you have come to us. Join us, and you will be the future dictator of the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not everyone in the audience had departed at this point. Those normal citizens who were still here were transformed into greyish-blue statues as the greyish-blue light shone on them from the sky. They couldn’t move at all, and there seemed to be struggling against frightened spirits above their heads.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt his heart sink. The Holy Ghost Church was so unbridled and unscrupulous. What did that mean? It meant they had absolute faith in their strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at this time that the vice-founder’s eyes suddenly turned toward the city, as if she had felt something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, everyone began to feel the earth trembling faintly beneath their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan also felt this, even from some distance away. He turned around in shock, and he was one step earlier than the vice-founder to realize that something was amiss. However, his perception was different from that of the the Holy Ghost Church’s vice-founder. He was far more sensitive, and he could tell that this quake was coming from the location Huo Yuhao had released the green signal from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What’s happening?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder soared into the sky and transformed into a greyish-blue light projection as she swept through the air. She was moving way too quickly, and took the greyish-blue radiance that had spread out across the sky with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder gazed down upon Radiant City from a thousand meters up in the sky. Her initially calm and composed eyes transformed in that instant, and her pupils became as thin as a needle’s tip as she witnessed something that she would never forget for the rest of her life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something was happening in one corner of Radiant City. There was no warning at all as large masses of structures and buildings suddenly collapsed and sank, while stone and gravel were hurled into the sky from where the ground was collapsing inwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great earth roared furiously in the next moment. The ground that had sunk now began to rise with lightning speed, and a colossal mushroom cloud accompanied by unrivaled explosive power surged into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-founder was watching from a thousand meters in the sky, but she was still impacted this horrifying scene. She plummeted down at once, and laid down flat on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom, boom, boom, boom…!</span></p>

Everything was trembling and quaking, and it seemed as if Hell itself had descended upon Radiant City in that instant. An incomparably terrifying explosive impact swept over a third of the greatest city on the Continent in the blink of an eye, and intense shockwaves shook the entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Uncounted tons of gravel and dust flew in all directions as millions of fragments and bits of debris soared into the sky. Soil and earth billowed through the air as the scorching and horrifying shockwaves continued to ripple through the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This effect was something that not even Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells could accomplish. The entirety of Radiant City was quivering and groaning from the explosion, and was crumbling before it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were more than ten million people from all over the continent here in Radiant City to participate in and watch the tournaments. There were a lot more who were gathered in the western suburbs, all waiting for the Radiant City Elite Soul Engineering Tournament’s results. However, one third of Radiant City had already collapsed; how many lives would those frightening shockwaves take?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky was dark and gloomy over the Douluo Continent on this day, and the world was transformed.</span></p>

He didn’t dare to bring He Caitou and himself into his spectral demiplane because the petrifying explosion that resembled an apocalypse seemed to blow the heterogeneous space around them into smithereens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A yellow shadow appeared behind Huo Yuhao and He Caitou amidst the hurricane of stone and gravel and picked them up, one person in each hand. The three of them disappeared without a trace amidst a few flickers of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys did this?” Elder Xuan’s deep voice rang out beside Huo Yuhao’s ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still inside his human-shaped soul tool, but he subconsciously nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a massacre!” Elder Xuan’s elderly voice was filled with sorrow and astonishment. He lowered his voice and said, “Don’t ever speak of this to anyone. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao’s voice was trembling as an indescribable agony rose from his heart. He hadn’t expected something like this to happen, that he would trigger an explosion so horrifying that it almost wiped out the entirety of Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally understood the pain in Elder Xuan’s voice. An explosion like this would take countless lives, and there were many more who would slowly slip into the void.</span></p>

This great explosion, known by later generations as the Day of Darkness and Destruction, had absolutely delayed the Sun Moon Empire’s plans to invade the Douluo Continent. Huo Yuhao, an Ultimate Soldier, had achieved a level of destructiveness unmatched across human history.</span></p>

At this moment, their faces were all devoid of color as they lay prostrate on the ground and felt the impact of the cyclone of stone and sand. They felt the earth’s moans, and nobody knew what to do.</span></p>

The Body Douluo, Du Busi, was leading the Star Luo Empire and the Heavenly Soul Empire’s company, and they stared with slack jaws and widened eyes at the mushroom cloud looming over Radiant City. They found it hard to believe what had just happened.</span></p>

The Star Luo Empire and the Heavenly Soul Empire had a backup plan, and they had used ground-drilling soul tools that they had specifically researched to escape Radiant City underneath the eastern front. The Sun Moon Empire’s army couldn’t stop them in the end. However, not in their wildest dreams did they expect to see such a magnificent sight, which was so apocalyptic at the same time.</span></p>
