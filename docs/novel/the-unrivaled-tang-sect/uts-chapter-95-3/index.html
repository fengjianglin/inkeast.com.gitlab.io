 <p><strong>Book 12: The Strength of the Preparatory Team</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 95.3: The Top 10 Savage Beasts</strong></p>
 <p>As he spoke, the elderly man extended his hand towards Huo Yuhao, trying to grab hold of him.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao did not resist, as both he and Wang Dong were completely helpless against the elderly man. The immense Titled Douluo-level abilities of the elderly man allowed him to summon his soul power to suppress their actions.</p>
 <p>Once he grabbed hold of Huo Yuhao, the elderly man tightened his grip on Huo Yuhao’s neck using his other hand. A gush of vast soul power surged instantly into Huo Yuhao’s body.</p>
 <p>At this point, Huo Yuhao felt his body swelling up like a balloon. Regardless of whether it was the Skydream Iceworm, the Ice Empress or Electrolux, they did not react. Against an invincible opponent, none of them could save him with this diminutive figure of his.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt that the whole situation was absurd. Am I just going to ridiculously die like that? It was only his first time seeing Cheng Gang! Furthermore, he was not even any form of Soul Beast.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Something’s not right.” Cheng Gang was suddenly dazed, and the soul power that he had injected into Huo Yuhao’s body suddenly stalled. Following that, he swiftly rushed to the bedside and flung Huo Yuhao onto the bed. After that, both of his hands slapped Huo Yuhao’s body rapidly.</p>
 <p>This time, the surge of soul power was considerably less than before. Huo Yuhao could only feel a numbing sensation originating from the bones all around his body. He could not tell whether he was comfortable or feeling awful as this sensation coursed through his entire body. But Cheng Gang’s dense soul power did agitate the circulation of blood in his veins, which alleviated the overbearing pain caused by the Ice Empress.</p>
 <p>As Cheng Gang increased the frequency of his slaps on Huo Yuhao’s body with his palms, his expression became more and more dismal too.</p>
 <p>Finally, he wrenched Huo Yuhao from the bed and dragged him in front of him, bellowing, “Are you not the rebirth of a savage beast?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao stared at him coldly, “Since when did I tell you that I am the rebirth of a savage beast? I am a true, living human being!”</p>
 <p>Cheng Gang reacted to his words like a deflated balloon and threw Huo Yuhao onto the bed violently. Then, he said depressingly, “How is this possible, how is this possible? I clearly sensed the aura of a savage beast! I can’t be wrong. Only extremely powerful savage beasts will possess such a strong undulation of life force!”</p>
 <p>Under the suppression of his soul power, Huo Yuhao was immobile. However, he could still speak, “That’s because of your own greed. There’s no harm in telling you, my Ice Martial Soul is indeed the Ice Jade Scorpion.”</p>
 <p>Cheng Gang’s face was struck with a look of revelation. “So that’s the case. So that’s the case… It’s just that... how are you able to make the aura of the martial soul of your Ice Jade Scorpion appear with traces of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion? This is impossible! Moreover, how did the martial soul of the Ice Jade Scorpion appear? I have never heard of anyone who possesses such a martial soul.”</p>
 <p>With regards to this Titled Douluo elder who had appeared so abruptly, Huo Yuhao was extremely riled up, and he bellowed in rage, “How should I know? Aren’t you the Titled Douluo here? You should know better than I do. But you came here to grab me before even clarifying the situation?”</p>
 <p>“Forget it, Yuhao. This elder is not being deliberate here either.” Wang Dong finally spoke, and his voice in an unusual, tender tone. He even coupled the smile on his face with adulation. “People cannot avoid making mistakes. Elder Cheng might be a super expert, a Titled Douluo, but it’s inevitable that he will make mistakes too. He’s not doing this on purpose, and he didn’t cause you any real harm either. Just forget it.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, Wang Dong even shot a look at Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>They had been partners for such long time, to the point where they were practically telepathic. Huo Yuhao felt his heart skip a beat as he instantly understood what Wang Dong was trying to do and scowled at himself – he wasn’t as calm as Wang Dong in such a crucial moment!</p>
 <p>Only the three of them were inside the room at this moment, and the entire room had been sealed off. If this Titled Douluo wanted to cover up what had just transpired, or if he suddenly felt murderous and wanted to silence them forever, then nobody could save them!</p>
 <p>However, a sudden change in attitude wasn’t the way to go either. Huo Yuhao grunted once and stopped talking entirely.</p>
 <p>Cheng Gang growled, “It’s just my bad luck. You two little kids better watch your mouths.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong inquired, “I haven’t asked – what is your title?”</p>
 <p>Cheng Gang snorted indifferently and said, “Neither of you are worthy of knowing it.” As he spoke, he waved his right hand and withdrew the soul power in the room. With that, he leapt through the window, and his figure vanished.</p>
 <p>Only when they couldn’t feel that intense pressure anymore did Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao heave a heavy sigh of relief at the same time. They could sense how close they had been to death in front of power as real as what had just stood before them.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao walked up to close the window once again. He clenched his fists tightly and turned to Wang Dong. “We were bullied and humiliated just because we’re weak. I will remember his humiliation by heart, and I will avenge it.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong didn’t respond directly, instead changing the subject. “Wash up, let’s go eat.”</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged and stepped into the bathroom. At this moment, he felt as if the dormant Skydream Iceworm and Ice Jade Empress Scorpion had just woken from their slumber.</p>
 <p>“There are truly many talented individuals hiding in plain sight. I only released a single strand of my aura that day, and I was instantly discovered. How dangerous. However, it was only a weak Titled Douluo. Who knew that a day like this would come, when a person with abilities as weak as his could stomp around arrogantly before me. Back in the day, I would have turned him into an ice statue.”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress’ voice was filled with fury and exasperation.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao sighed and asked, “Ice Empress, what are the Ten Great Savage Beasts?”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress knew that he was feeling a little despondent, and thus explained patiently, “The Ten Great Savage Beasts is a term used by humans to refer to the ten most powerful Soul Beasts on the mainland. It’s only a ranking given to the few that they know. That guy is an idiot – once we break through the two hundred thousand year mark, we cannot be reborn into a human anymore. The weakest of the Ten Great Savage Beasts have already had more than three hundred thousand years to reach mastery – how can they take human forms? He didn’t even consider that.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was distracted by this discussion about the Ten Savage Beasts. “Who is on the list? I didn’t know that there were so many Transcendent Soul Beasts.”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress answered, “You wouldn’t know even if I told you. However, the Ten Savage Beasts may not be the most powerful soul beasts. Put simply, the older a soul beast is, the more powerful it becomes. However, the list curated by humans doesn’t include the oceanic soul beasts. Even if the list only included the soul beasts on land, it doesn’t include entities like Skydream, who train through hibernation, and other powerful entities who haven’t been discovered by you humans.”</p>
 <p>“Oceanic soul beasts? Are they powerful?” Huo Yuhao asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress replied without hesitation. “Of course they are powerful. However, the truly powerful ones all reside in the deepest abyss of the ocean. Furthermore, humans have limited abilities to venture into the sea, so the oceanic soul beasts aren’t disturbed by humans as much as the soul beasts on land. Thus overall, they are collectively more powerful than the soul beasts on land. However, the competition for survival in the ocean is a lot crueler, so the various breeds of soul beasts in the ocean are a lot larger than those on land. Therefore, even powerful oceanic soul beasts run the risk of death if they meet an even more terrifying species of soul beast. This is the reason why I cannot confirm whether oceanic soul beasts can rival the most powerful soul beast on land.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded in acknowledgement and asked, “Who’s topping the list of Ten Savage Beasts? What’s his power like?”</p>
 <p>“I’m not too sure myself,” The Ice Empress answered, “You should ask the Skydream Iceworm, maybe he’ll know. All I know is that the leader of the Ten Savage Beasts resides in the Great Star Dou Forest. However, I don’t think he’s more powerful than the Snow Empress.”</p>
 <p>“Right, Brother Skydream, how could I forget about you? You have a million years of soul power – you should be considered one of the savage beasts, shouldn’t you?”</p>
 <p>“Him? A savage beast?” Before the Skydream Iceworm could respond, the Ice Empress dismissed his comment. “He’s just a gluttonous bug, he can’t be considered a savage beast. If not for his ‘contributions’ to the Great Star Dou Forest, there wouldn’t have been so many powerful soul beasts there.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm was indignant and retorted, “Isn’t your bloodline better? If you had just played nice and followed me, we would have been able to combine our powers as husband and wife, and we would have reigned supreme over the world!”</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress laughed coldly and said, “Husband and wife? Are you even worthy? I think you’re only worthy enough to be my food. If you had just let me gobble you up back then, I might have actually become the most powerful individual on the mainland.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm did not flatter the Ice Empress as much as before anymore. Perhaps it was due to his realization that his chances with the Ice Empress weren’t too great anyway, but he had decided to toughen up. “Eat, all you know to do is eat. Are you a scorpion or a pig?”</p>
 <p>“Do you wish to die?” the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion muttered darkly.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm fearlessly exclaimed, “Come! Bite me! Since we’re all locusts on the same string, Yuhao will die if I die, and you will be gone if he dies. Hmph.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, stop arguing. Let’s just go to sleep.” Huo Yuhao tapped himself on the head as he felt a headache coming on.</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress said, “Yuhao, your body is slowly recovering. You should work hard to break through to Rank 30; then you’ll be able to control my powers more smoothly – at least, you’ll be able to protect yourself much better.”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Huo Yuhao answered.</p>
 <p>At this point, the frail old voice of Electrolux rang out. “Obtain that Ominous Soul-Devouring Carving Knife as quickly as you can. It holds great meaning for you, and for me as well. With it, my consciousness will no longer run the risk of dissipating.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Compared to the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress, Huo Yuhao was more deferential towards the Electrolux, and even trusted his words more. He wasn’t just calm and composed. He used to be a human himself!</p>
 <p>Once he finished washing up, Huo Yuhao went out for a meal with Wang Dong. Neither of them mentioned anything about what had just transpired – even though their opponent had been a Titled Douluo, it had still been a great humiliation. Furthermore, their team were the only members of Shrek Academy inside Star Luo City, as they were the contest participants, and the leader of the entire group was Teacher Wang Yan, who was only a Soul King. Who could seek justice for them? That guy was a Titled Douluo from the Star Luo Empire! This humiliation would be forever imprinted in their hearts.</p>
