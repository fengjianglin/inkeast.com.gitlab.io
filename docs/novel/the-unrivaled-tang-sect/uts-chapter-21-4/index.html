 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 21.4: Fusion of the Three Innate Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p>After hearing Zhou Yi’s words, the two raised their heads, exposing a trace of amazement in their eyes. There was no need to mention the fact that all twenty-two teams from their class had passed the assessment, but there were actually fourteen teams that had entered the top 64. In other words, their class alone occupied over 20% of the top 64 spots; the percentage of students from Class 1 who managed to enter the knockout round was double that of the other classes. With a result like this, they truly deserved to be arrogant!</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi continued speaking. “During the round-robin tournament, a total of six teams managed to win every single match they participated in. Our class only has one such team. Originally, I was planning to give them a reward, but unfortunately, they turned up late to class. Hence, their merits are equal to their demerits, so I won’t reward them or punish them.”</p>
 <p>Once again, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong became the center of attention of the entire class. The two of them truly felt depressed! They then looked each other in the eye. Their gazes looked normal, but both of them were stunned.</p>
 <p>When they looked at each other, they clearly sensed the soul power in their bodies undulate for a moment. This caused a sense of intimacy that was hard to describe to involuntarily arise, so much so that they felt like hugging each other again.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two simultaneously thought of the reason why they had ended up on Wang Dong’s bed after hugging each other.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong muttered, “Could we have succeeded?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was more certain of the answer than Wang Dong. After all, he had talked to the Skydream Iceworm! He naturally couldn’t appear too certain, but he couldn’t help but expose a fervent look in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“It could be. Shall we try it out after class?”</p>
 <p>“Yep.”</p>
 <p>The two nodded at each other at what seemed to be the same instant. A hard-to-describe sense of understanding involuntarily arose between the two, and although Huo Yuhao’s Mental Detection hadn’t been activated, the two of them seemed to be able to predict their counterpart’s next move. This feeling made them feel as if they were twins; it felt wonderful, yet extraordinarily peculiar.</p>
 <p>“Thump——” A loud sound jolted the two from that peculiar feeling. The two simultaneously raised their heads, just in time for them to see Zhou Yi’s angry face.</p>
 <p>Oops… their absent-mindedness during class had been caught.</p>
 <p>“You two, go outside and start running with chainmail on you. You’re not allowed to stop until the bell rings. You two just achieved something, but you’re already so satisfied with yourselves!”</p>
 <p><em>This isn’t fair!</em> The two simultaneously cried out in their hearts. However, they knew that as long as Teacher Zhou decided on something, there was no way she would change her mind. Helplessly, they could only leave the classroom with a bitter look on their faces and return to their dorms to get their chainmail.</p>
 <p>As she saw the two leave dejectedly, Zhou Yi snorted, “All of you, remember this. No matter how successful you are, you must always have a humble and cautious heart. Not only can arrogance cause you to deteriorate, it can also take your life. The knockout round will start tomorrow, so I’ll give you a simple explanation regarding its main parts.”</p>
 <p>The two of them were doomed to not listen to Zhou Yi’s explanation, but it was fortunate that Xiao Xiao was still there. Although she didn’t explicitly state it, Zhou Yi intended Xiao Xiao to pass the information on to them.</p>
 <p>“I’m blaming you for this.” Once they left the teaching block, Wang Dong exploded, speaking angrily to Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had a wronged expression on his face as he said, “How can you blame me for this? You were the one who insisted on me hugging you yesterday.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” A cold light appeared in Wang Dong’s eyes as he looked at Huo Yuhao with clenched teeth.</p>
 <p>“Uh… we’re a team, we should be united.” Huo Yuhao solemnly looked towards Wang Dong, who already had his fists clenched.</p>
 <p>“Unity my ass. You’re the reason why I got punished, so you tell me what you’re going to do about it.” Wang Dong said angrily, “Also, you slept on my bed last night. What’re you going to do about that?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao patted Wang Dong’s shoulder while putting his hand around his neck, “Okay, okay. We’re all brothers, so we shouldn’t bicker over a small matter like this. Okay? We should just quickly finish Teacher Zhou’s task, just in case she flips out on us.”</p>
 <p>In the instant Huo Yuhao placed his hand around Wang Dong’s neck, Wang Dong was immediately stunned. Huo Yuhao’s voice had also become softer. After speaking, the two completely stopped moving. Huo Yuhao subconsciously looked towards his hands; Wang Dong did as well.</p>
 <p>“Why would this happen?” The two spoke in unison.</p>
 <p>Correct, a strange thing had happened to the two. When Huo Yuhao’s hand touched Wang Dong’s neck, it seemed like the two had been connected. Huo Yuhao’s soul power had flowed into Wang Dong’s body in a very natural manner, while Wang Dong’s soul power had slowly flowed back. It was as if the two had formed a complete whole. Although the connection was only formed from Wang Dong’s neck and Huo Yuhao’s hand, that feeling was very clear.</p>
 <p>“That’s not right, let’s try it again.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao first pulled back the hand he was holding Wang Dong with, before gripping Wang Dong’s two hands with his own hands.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s hands were unusually soft, and they were extremely smooth; it was very comfortable to hold them. However, the present Huo Yuhao didn’t have the time to fully experience this feeling.</p>
 <p>In the instant the two held hands, the soul power from Huo Yuhao’s Mysterious Heaven Technique started moving. It flowed rapidly from his right hand into Wang Dong’s left hand. Then, his left hand generated what seemed to be an absorption force that absorbed Wang Dong’s soul power into his body. The soul power of the two rapidly circulated, and the speed of this circulation was at least double the speed of Huo Yuhao’s previous circulation speed.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was a genius among geniuses in the first place, so he immediately realised what had happened. “Try controlling it for a bit. Try and pour it into your body.” As he spoke, he pulled back his left hand. This way, only his soul power was being transferred to Huo Yuhao’s body.</p>
 <p>Immediately, Huo Yuhao felt that his soul power was explosively increasing at a astonishing rate; an unprecedented feeling of power filled his entire body.</p>
 <p>As a result of being remoulded by the Mysterious Water Pill and nourished by the Mysterious Heaven Technique, the endurance of his passageways had already reached the apex of what could be achieved by his peers. Although a large amount of soul power had entered his body, he didn’t feel bloated at all.</p>
 <p>An imperceptible sense of understanding had already appeared between the two of them. Huo Yuhao immediately activated his Mental Detection, enveloping Wang Dong within it.</p>
 <p>For the sake of immersing himself in this bizarre feeling, Wang Dong shut his eyes. Immediately, he discovered that the range of Huo Yuhao’s Mental Detection was increasing at an astonishing rate.</p>
 <p>Originally, Huo Yuhao’s Mental Detection could exceed a range of sixty metres when it was activated in a spherical manner; it could reach a hundred metres or so when it was focused in one direction. However, his Mental Detection quickly reached a radius of a hundred metres as a result of Wang Dong’s additional soul power.</p>
 <p>As the two stared stupefied at each other, Huo Yuhao’s voice trembled slightly, “Wang Dong, have you heard of soul masters who can share their soul power with another person who they fused their martial soul with?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong blankly shook his head and muttered, “Why would this happen? Don’t tell me that our attempt yesterday actually succeeded?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao had an excited expression as he said, “Shall we find a place to try it out?”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, an angry voice rang out from the window of the nearby teaching block: “Why aren’t you two wearing your chainmail and running? Why’re you holding hands and courting each other?”</p>
