 <p><strong>Book 7: The Extreme North</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 40.3: Skydream, Ice Emperor&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>In this exact instant, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but widen his eyes after thinking of a certain possibility.</p>
 <p>With their current combination, coming to the Extreme North would undoubtedly pose an enormous danger to them. Though the Skydream Iceworm was powerful, he was currently attached to Huo Yuhao after becoming his first soul ring. Even if he was an intelligent soul ring, he was still a part of him. He still relied mainly on Huo Yuhao’s strength to determine whether they were strong or weak.</p>
 <p>Under a situation like this, the Skydream Iceworm’s best option should’ve been to make Huo Yuhao stronger by obtaining his other soul rings first. Once he was strong enough, they could’ve come to the Extreme North to find this so-called Ice Emperor in order to awaken his second martial soul!</p>
 <p>However, the Skydream Iceworm had impatiently decided to come here and find the extremely terrifyingly strong Ice Emperor right after he’d gotten to Rank 20. Was it even possible for there to be no danger involved in this journey? Regardless of how meticulously the Skydream Iceworm had planned everything out, he and Huo Yuhao might be buried eternally in the Extreme North if he made a single mistake.</p>
 <p>Just what made the Skydream Iceworm insist on him coming here, even if there was an enormous risk involved in doing so? Was it just to make him become even stronger? After hearing its gentle voice, it really didn’t seem like the case!</p>
 <p>After this thought flashed through Huo Yuhao’s mind, he unexpectedly went silent. He didn’t have any other choice but to believe in the Skydream Iceworm. More than that, he prayed that the Skydream Iceworm hadn’t come here due to the reason he’d thought of. Right now, he could only patiently wait and observe silently.</p>
 <p>“Skydream, you’re courting death.” The Ice Emperor’s clear voice was suddenly filled with killing intent, and the jade green sky instantly turned dark green. An intense killing intent descended from the sky, and the originally protected hundred meter diameter around the Skydream Iceworm’s body instantly shrank to a diameter of ten meters.</p>
 <p>However, the Skydream Iceworm wasn’t scared of the Ice Emperor in a simple contest of spiritual power. Smiling, he spoke in a very unhurried and graceful manner, “No, I’m just expressing my true feelings. I’ve lived for a million years, and I’ve spent a large majority of them sleeping. However, the only thing within the depths of my heart that I can’t control is you. Ice Emperor, do you know why I’ve chosen to come back at a time like this? It’s because I’ve calculated that you’re about to reach your limit and reach a dead end within a hundred years. At that time, you won’t be able to break through to the next rank. Then, you’ll disappear in this icy world. That’s why I’ve come back. I can’t wait anymore, and an endless life has no more meaning to me. I don’t have much longer to live anymore. I’ve come back to let you continue living and let us truly be together.”</p>
 <p>Inwardly sighing, Huo Yuhao shut his eyes. Sure enough, that was the case! The Skydream Iceworm had really tricked him; he truly had his own motives for coming here.</p>
 <p>From the moment he’d met the Skydream Iceworm, Huo Yuhao had trusted him unconditionally from the bottom of his heart. The Skydream Iceworm had given him a million year soul ring in addition to four soul skills, which was equivalent to giving him a brand new life.</p>
 <p>In Huo Yuhao’s heart, the person he’d felt the most grateful to was this fellow, this intelligent soul ring of his. The Skydream Iceworm had a higher position in his heart than Tang Ya, Bei Bei, and even Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>At this moment however, Huo Yuhao felt as if something within his heart had shattered. The emotions he’d repressed since his youth suddenly exploded out like a dam bursting. He lied to me, he actually lied to me!</p>
 <p>An unprecedented amount of grievance turned into a river of teardrops that flowed down his cheeks before rapidly freezing into chunks of ice that gathered by the corners of his eyes. After all, Huo Yuhao was only twelve. Just as he’d believed that everything in front of him was filled with hope, the Skydream Iceworm’s betrayal had instantly shattered his tenacious heart.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao wasn’t scared of hardships, nor was he scared of any difficulties. As long as he saw hope in front of him, he was willing to give it his all.</p>
 <p>His one year in Shrek Academy had changed his personality drastically. In Shrek Academy, he had friends, teachers, and companions. From another standpoint, this had all been given to him by the Skydream Iceworm. It was precisely because of the Skydream Iceworm’s existence that he had confidence and faith in his heart. However, the Skydream Iceworm’s betrayal had practically cut off the root of his faith, brazenly uprooting the tall, confidence-filled tree from his heart.</p>
 <p>This feeling could no longer be described using the word ‘painful’. Huo Yuhao’s hope had been completely obliterated.</p>
 <p>Though the Skydream Iceworm’s spiritual power was extremely powerful, he had focused all of his energy on the Ice Emperor’s reaction; he didn’t notice the heaven-shaking, earth-shattering transformation in Huo Yuhao’s heart.</p>
 <p>Hearing the Skydream Iceworm’s words, the Ice Emperor turned silent. As if the Skydream Iceworm had precisely called out the worries in its heart, it pondered silently.</p>
 <p>Somewhat nervous, the Skydream Iceworm said, “I’ve come back, Ice Emperor. We haven’t seen each other for so many years, but you’re not even willing to come and see me in person?”</p>
 <p>The Ice Emperor’s cold voice rang out again. “Skydream, don’t you know that my tribe is a predator of your tribe?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm laughed indifferently, “I know that of course, but why does that matter? Is there a rule that states that one can’t like their own predator? And it’s precisely because of that that I like you even more.”</p>
 <p>The Ice Emperor said disdainfully, “Unfortunately, you don’t have the qualifications to like me. However, I’m very touched. You’ve actually agreed to bring yourself back as food for me to eat. How could I not help you accomplish your goal to fuse our bodies together like this? You should be able to sense that I’m approaching you right now. Just wait for me, I’ll get to you within fifteen minutes. I’ll take all of your love, and I’ll treat you well. I’ll slowly eat your body and energy bit by bit and make you a part of my body.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm seemed to already be familiar with the Ice Emperor’s way of speaking. Somewhat helpless, he said, “Can’t you be a bit gentler? You’re always so cold and overbearing. It’s no wonder you’re still single. Right, I’ve always wanted to ask you this: is that joke going around the Extreme North true? Did you like the Snow Emperor back then?”</p>
 <p>“Skydream, I’ll definitely rend your body into ten thousand pieces!” The Skydream Iceworm’s words seemed to have touched upon the Ice Emperor’s most sensitive feelings, causing its voice to instantly become hysterical. At that moment, the dark green sky suddenly turned a deep black.</p>
 <p>The smile on the Skydream Iceworm’s mouth had never disappeared, as if it was purposely trying to rile up the Ice Emperor. On the other hand, there were no longer tears flowing from the eyes of the hiding Huo Yuhao. Only, he felt his heart go somewhat cold.</p>
 <p>From their conversation, it was obvious that the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Emperor had many grudges and emotions between them. It was definitely not as simple as the Skydream Iceworm had said. The Skydream Iceworm had purposely riled up the Ice Emperor, which meant that he definitely had his own motives; he definitely had a move he was planning to unleash.</p>
 <p>However, did this really matter to him? Was the Skydream Iceworm still deserving of his trust? He had lied to him, bringing him to this danger-filled Extreme North. Was his only objective to help him awaken his second martial soul? No, that was definitely not the case. In the end, he had still lied to him.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Huo Yuhao’s face gradually turned chilly. The grief in his heart had caused a violent change to occur in his mental state. His nervousness and excitement had disappeared, and only a patch of ice remained in his heart.</p>
 <p>As if it had sensed the change in Huo Yuhao’s emotions, the gray pearl located within the depths of his mind shook lightly. However, it quickly returned to normal.</p>
 <p>A voice that Huo Yuhao couldn’t hear muttered to itself within the gray pearl, “The personality this kid’s cultivated since his youth goes to extremes too easily. His greatest weakness is his own heart. To him, this could be considered a form of training. Otherwise, how will he be able to mature? It’s better for me to not interfere. However, that large worm’s made me look at him with a completely new light than before!”</p>
 <p>The gray pearl then quieted down. In this exact instant, the Skydream Iceworm’s voice rang out in Huo Yuhao’s mind, “Yuhao, the preparations are all ready. When I give you the signal, you’ll have to endure the cold. You’ll have to persevere, got it?”</p>
 <p>“I will.” Huo Yuhao replied coldly.</p>
 <p>Possibly due to the nervousness he felt, the Skydream Iceworm didn’t notice the change in Huo Yuhao’s mental state.</p>
 <p>After fifteen minutes passed, the Ice Emperor who said that it’d take fifteen minutes to appear finally showed itself.</p>
 <p>The dark sky turned jade green, and a jade green light streaked across the sky. With that flash of jade light, another soul beast appeared in front of the Skydream Iceworm.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was also concentratedly observing what was going on. Though he hadn’t personally seen the third-ranked Titan Ice Devil King, he’d seen its terrifying footsteps before. In his opinion, the Ice Emperor who was also a member of the Three Emperors shouldn’t be much smaller than the Titan Ice Devil Emperor.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but feel somewhat stunned when the Ice Emperor finally appeared in his perception. He couldn’t help but inwardly sigh in admiration, It’s really too pretty.</p>
 <p>Right, the Ice Emperor was very beautiful. Though it was just a soul beast, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but sigh in admiration.</p>
 <p>The Ice Emperor was roughly 1.5 meters long, which meant that it wasn’t even as big as the Skydream Iceworm’s previous body. Huo Yuhao had made lots of predictions towards the Ice Emperor’s race, but they were all wrong. The Ice Emperor was a scorpion, a scorpion whose beauty had reached the pinnacle.</p>
 <p>Could the words ‘scorpion’ and ‘beautiful’ even be used together? Huo Yuhao was now certain of his answer to this question.</p>
 <p>The 1.5-meter-long Ice Emperor had two colors on its body. One was the color of ice, and the other was a jade green color.</p>
 <p>The front end of its body had four layers stacked above each other, and each layer was longer than the previous one by a third of a meter. Its head lay on the frontmost layer, and its silver-white mouth shone with an ominous, cold light. The front of its body was covered a type of special scale that Huo Yuhao had never learned of in Shrek Academy. No, instead of call it a scale, it was more accurate to say that it was protruding outwards.</p>
