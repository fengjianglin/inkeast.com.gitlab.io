 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But right now, Huo Yuhao took advantage of the lion’s focus on his Darkgolden Terrorclaws to activate his Ice Explosion soul skill on its left forelimb.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most solid fortresses were often felled from the inside; when the soul power in the lion’s left claw turned into explosive energy, this was exactly what happened. The Ice Explosion soul skill showed its might once more, blowing the lion’s left claw to bits. The frightening blast also riddled half of the lion’s body with injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Huo Yuhao miss such an advantageous attack?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track to accurately appear at the place where the lion was weakest. A powerful suction force was released towards the lion from Huo Yuhao. While it didn’t drag the lion to him, it did increase his speed towards the lion. With no defenses to bar its way, his right claw stabbed into the lion, causing its pathetic, miserable cries to instantly stop as it died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At present, all four metal-type soul beasts had been killed. What remained were only four purple soul rings, which floated silently in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pressed his left hand to the Golden Lion’s body, making another bomb out of it with the Ice Explosion soul skill. He then ran towards the center of the arena alongside He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he included the Spectre Wolf that he’d killed earlier, Huo Yuhao now had three ice bombs at his disposal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gong Changlong regretted speaking up for the two of them earlier; they’d killed six of his thousand year soul beasts! It had been very difficult to catch them—especially the four metal-type soul beasts that had come at the end. They’d taken him an entire year to train, yet it had all been for naught the moment that Huo Yuhao slaughtered them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t anything like a normal control-type soul master. Even comparing him to agility-type soul masters wasn’t quite appropriate. To be honest, he was more of a mesh between assault-type and agility-type soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From start to finish, Huo Yuhao had killed all six soul beasts during the test. He Caitou had only needed to help once, which had been to prevent the tiger and lion from meeting up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s very impressive display had already gone far beyond the elders’ expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t get complacent. He’d given it his all, and had used every advantage available to him. He might have depleted a lot of his soul power when he’d used his Darkgolden Terrorclaws to kill the Golden Panther, but that was to ensure that he didn’t give the panther any chances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If these four metal-type soul beasts teamed up, it would’ve been a large problem for Huo Yuhao and He Caitou. Huo Yuhao had been most concerned about the Golden Panther, since it was the most cunning soul beast of the four.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It hadn’t rush Huo Yuhao immediately, even though it held an absolute advantage in terms of speed. Instead, it had waited for an opportunity to group up with the other beasts. It was basically the general of the four soul beasts. After obtaining the Darlgolden Terrorclaws, Huo Yuhao’s offensive might soared. But he was still left with glaring weaknesses: He was weak against long-range attacks and lightning-quick opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As panther-type soul beasts were incredibly fast, the Golden Panther could’ve dragged He Caitou over if it had used hit-and-run tactics, and thus forced Huo Yuhao to fight an uphill battle against the lion and tiger together. While Huo Yuhao was confident that he could take on these two soul beasts at the same time, it would’ve been far more consuming, both mentally and physically.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why he chose the simpler approach—killing the Golden Panther with his Darkgolden Terrorclaws quickly, albeit at the expense of his soul power. He’d then used the panther’s corpse to attack the tiger. While this ‘simple’ method indeed dealt with them, it didn’t seem cost effective for his soul power. However, Huo Yuhao might have expended even more soul power if he’d been sucked into a drawn out fight with the soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone and Darkgolden Terrorclaw Right Palm Bone had shown their worth in this battle. Huo Yuhao’s fighting capabilities were completely new to the deans and Fan Yu—he’d been more offensive than a four-ringed assault type Soul Ancestor as a three-ringed control-type Soul Elder. The elders felt nothing but shock and awe after witnessing him killing the six soul beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, there was an exception to that awed feeling: Gong Changlong currently felt extremely gloomy right now, as he was the person in charge of the Beast Dueling Arena. His heart ached when he thought of the fact that six thousand year soul beasts had been wasted just like that! The amount of human and material resources needed to catch and train another six just like them would be astronomically high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Send in eight thousand year souls beasts adept at long-range attacks, and four three-thousand year soul beasts adept at close combat. I don’t believe that these kids will be able to handle them all.” Increasing the pace of the test made Gong Changlong’s heart ache, but it meant that it would end faster. However, this wasn’t too shocking. After all, Huo Yuhao had displayed abilities far beyond their initial expectations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked a little weird now. He had 2 cigars in his mouth: One thick, and one thin. They were, respectively, the ‘Spirit Stimulating Thick Cigar,’ and the ‘Soul Power Amplifying Thin Cigar.’ He grasped a Milk Bottle in his hand, as did He Caitou. The two of them leaned on each other as they stood there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were suddenly jolted, and Huo Yuhao exclaimed, “So many…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou was also stunned. “They’re trying to kill us…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Twelve soul beasts sauntered in from different directions. There was four huge beasts in front, and eight others trailing behind. They inched closer and closer to them in the center of the arena. The huge pressure emitting from them made Huo Yuhao and He Caitou pretty terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had seemed very relaxed as he dealt with the four soul beasts earlier, but that was already giving it his all. But now, their number had tripled, and from the looks of it, several of them were long-ranged attackers. Twelve thousand year soul beasts! If Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao were here, then Huo Yuhao reckoned they might have a fighting chance. But could they really win in this situation now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior, what do we do?” He Caitou looked at the dozen thousand year soul beasts that surrounded them and felt numb. This was definitely beyond what they could handle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu’s brows furrowed, “Why didn’t Elder Gong follow the plan? This is too much. They must have been expended quite a lot of their energy already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xian Lin’er said, “Don’t fret. The pressure will do them good. Also we can tell their limits from this and plan out their future training. We’re ready to save the both of them if anything happens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shut his eyes slightly and sensed with his active spiritual power. He didn’t ask for help from the Skydream Iceworm, the Ice Empress or Electrolux, even in such a perilous situation. His confidence was slowly growing as his age and powers increased, and he knew how to turn pressure into motivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior—soul tool fort strategy. I will try and control the soul beasts, and you’ll follow up under the guidance of my Spiritual Detection to attack them. We’ll try our best and see what happens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” He Caitou didn’t speak too much either. His confidence in Huo Yuhao had grown immensely following the previous battle. Many metal pipes started to appear on his body as they made clanging noises. He Caitou turned around with all the weapons on his body, maintaining a solid grip on the floor underfoot. Showcasing his ability to mount a multi-directional assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao noticed that it was the same soul tool fort strategy, but a portion of He Caitou’s soul tool fort had already been modified. It seemed like he had made considerable progress after the Advanced Continental Soul Master Soul Dueling Tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dozen soul beasts were still stalking closer. The four in front were of the same species—the Single-Horned Devilrhino. A very powerful soul beast, entirely plated in armor. It was rumored to have a strong ram and sturdy defense, while its horn &nbsp;could unleash the Sealing Light. After locking onto an opponent, it would ram them till they perished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the arena, four Single-Horned Devilrhinos with more than three thousand years of cultivation were flashing with a subtle, light-blue radiance. Their eyes had turned blood-red, and they advanced forward faster now—ready to attack at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eight long-ranged attacker soul beasts behind them also began flashing with different colors, ready to attack at a moment’s notice. If it wasn’t for the small size of the Beast Dueling Arena and them not having enough space, Huo Yuhao and He Caitou would already be facing a barrage of attacks.</span></p>
