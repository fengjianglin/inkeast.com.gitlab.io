Huo Yuhao’s gaze met Ji Juechen’s, and they leapt up concurrently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Xuan Ziwen didn’t need to announce the start of the round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t burst towards each other immediately. They stared at each other from a hundred fifty meters away, standing in their positions quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An invisible pressure started to descend on the Soul Tool Experimentation Area. Ji Juechen wielded his sword with both hands, and his six soul rings resurfaced. A streak of sharp aura shot out from his body. His entire person seemed to fuse with the sword in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fusing his martial soul into the sword. This was Ji Juechen’s cultivation method. His martial soul was converted completely into force, and was no longer a physical entity. It fused completely with his Extraterrestrial Meteoric Sword. He was the sword, and the sword was him. They were inseparable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sharp aura originated from his swift and fierce sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Extraterrestrial Meteoric Sword let out a slight roar as he injected soul power into it. The tip of the sword seemed to be shaking slightly. Ji Juechen’s aura surged. Once this sword attacked, there was bound to be trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t move as much. He stood there quietly, with his arms were wide open to his sides. He slowly clenched his fists. Distorted rays of light started to shoot out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White, yellow, purple, black, red. Five different colored soul rings intersected and flashed on his body. It wasn’t possible to differentiate which colors were real and which were fake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An azure-green radiance shot out from his backbone. His clothes couldn’t conceal its intense light. Coming from his left arm was also an azure-green light, while his right arm was wreathed in dark-golden radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A bright golden light shone from his eyes, revealing his dominant aura. There was a purple sparkle amidst the gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao unleashed his soul power, soul bones, and soul rings with their highest potential in the face of a strong opponent. The hour of meditation allowed him to unleash his full power right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Against Ji Juechen, he had many ways to deal with him. But he wouldn’t use his soul skills. That was because he could clearly sense that this battle with Ji Juechen was his best opportunity to increase his mastery of the skill he’d inherited from Elder Mu—Sovereign’s Descent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen mentioned that he wanted to see Huo Yuhao’s fist, the one he’d used against Jing Ziyan. He wanted nothing but the fist. Ji Juechen also revealed his sword intent in front of Huo Yuhao without holding back. They were going to decide this duel with the simplest method. They would also compete in the simplest of things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Huo Yuhao’s aura was inferior to Ji Juechen’s. His aura wasn’t as condensed as his opponent’s. Against the sharp sword intent, his aura was easily cut through. Ji Juechen’s aura also ballooned and put a lot of pressure on Huo Yuhao himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s left leg made a half-step to the left. Just as the sole of his foot was about to land, a muffled sound was heard. Following that, an extremely frightening aura erupted from his body. This intent was overpoweringly strong, and resisted the sword intent closing in on him. Huo Yuhao managed to counteract the situation immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An illusory light projection also appeared behind Huo Yuhao, and the illusory image of the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion surfaced subtly on his back. That’s right, Huo Yuhao used the soul beast aura from the four hundred thousand year Ice Jade Empress Scorpion to make his aura even stronger, and resisted the sharp and swift sword intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen’s body jerked slightly, but the look in his eyes only became more resolute. His six soul rings flashed, and he held his sword with both hands. The tip of his sword pointed toward the ground, and one side of his body was slightly tilted forward. His legs were still. He was facing Huo Yuhao laterally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His sword intent transformed once again. It turned from swift and fierce—to vicious. His aura shrank and clashed again with Huo Yuhao’s aura. It managed to force his aura into retreating slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Intent! Fist intent! I need to use my own intent, not the Ice Empress’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt something in his mind shattering in the face of this tremendous pressure. A sobering feeling caused him to be jolted awake in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the few powerful beings slumbering in Huo Yuhao's spiritual sea woke up. They were shocked as they saw the golden ocean surge. The immense spiritual power released a bright golden light, and the entire spiritual sea was transforming greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ice Empress, give me protection.” The Skydream Iceworm spoke, and golden rings of light started to spread out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of his nine golden light rings was crushed. After that, it consolidated again to form an entity that resembled a golden sun. This golden sun directly flew above Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea and seemed to explode. Golden light expanded in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ice Empress also revealed her original form in the spiritual sea. She lifted her pincers, and a dim azure-green light projection was revealed. She and the Skydream Iceworm were engulfed within this projection. No matter how ferocious Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea was, it couldn’t impact them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux appeared beside them silently. As he saw the combusting golden sun above the spiritual sea, he revealed a slight smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t expect the change to be so quick and vast. Good, good, good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm also appeared to be very excited. His chubby figure twisted while he was protected by the Ice Empress. The remaining eight golden soul rings on his body also flashed with waves of golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A beautiful, white figure flashed into being for a moment. This figure seemed to mutter something before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t clear on everything happening in his spiritual world. He was in a very special state now. He could only feel his soul power and spiritual power, unleashed under the control of his mind, combining at a terrifying speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A great teacher could only provide shortcuts for his students. In this world, there was hardly anyone who was a better teacher than Elder Mu; former Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion, Ultimate Douluo, and the Dragon Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sovereign's Descent was the reason why Huo Yuhao’s soul and spiritual power had combined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Mu once told Huo Yuhao that the Sovereign's Descent was a path of its own. It combines spiritual and soul power; it was a special path that involved creating one’s own soul skill. To an ordinary soul master, they could cultivate it when they became a seven-ringed Soul Douluo. It was only then that their spiritual power could complement their soul power. However, this wasn’t necessarily the case for Huo Yuhao, a spiritual-type soul master. But Elder Mu could only guide him to this path. He had to decide how he wanted to walk this path, and to what extent he would.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used his talent and hard work to use the Sovereign's Descent before Elder Mu passed on. Elder Mu was very comforted by this, but he told Huo Yuhao that combining one’s soul and spiritual power was very rare on the continent. Even he did not know how far Huo Yuhao could progress down this path. He hoped that Huo Yuhao would seize every opportunity to improve. When he could make the Sovereign's Descent into one of his soul skills, he would become one of the best soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Huo Yuhao was in a magical power fusion state. The tremendous pressure unlocked his potential and caused him to improve significantly. His Eye of Destiny had already opened on its own. Fortunately for Huo Yuhao, a layer of intense light was already shining around him, so no one could see what he looked like. Otherwise, he would’ve been exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen continued to face Huo Yuhao. Right now, he was extremely shocked. Only he knew how frightening Huo Yuhao’s aura was at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d already reached his limit as he unleashed his sword intent at Huo Yuhao, but it was like a moth flying into the flame, likewise, it resembled waves hitting an immovable boulder. His sword intent couldn’t touch Huo Yuhao at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen knew he couldn’t wait any longer. His method of using his aura to take Huo Yuhao down was completely useless now. If he waited any longer, his confidence would collapse first, not to mention his aura.</span></p>
