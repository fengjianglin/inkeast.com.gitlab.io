 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor shook. He was astonished as he stared at Huo Yuhao with eyes, made from vines. “I didn’t expect your spiritual power to be so strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strong spiritual undulations were released from the Bluesilver Emperor and reflected onto Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao sensed every single change that happened to the entire mountain valley. The Bluesilver Emperor used himself as an intermediary to connect with every Bluesilver Grass in the mountain valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One human and one soul beast looked at each other, and smiled. They felt each other’s sincerity. At the same time, they picked up speed and rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor sighed. “If your martial soul was compatible with mine, I might have chosen you. You are very strong. Although my innate abilities can’t compare to many powerful soul beasts, Bluesilver Grass have very acute senses. From your body, I can sense that you have a bright future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled and replied, “When you see my friend, you won’t be disappointed. Her martial soul is a Bluesilver Emperor. You should know that there are very few humans that can cultivate Bluesilver Grass. There was one person who managed to successfully do so in the past, and this person was very powerful. That person is also my elder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor nodded and said, “I know who you’re talking about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Huo Yuhao was a little astonished as he looked at the Bluesilver Emperor. “You know about him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Bluesilver Emperor nodded and replied, “Although our species is small and weak, our life energy is actually the most prosperous among all plants. We also have the highest population among all the plant species in this world. Our roots are connected by our spiritual senses. This is why we can sense if anything big happens to one of us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is almost as rare to find Bluesilver Grass that can cultivate as it is to find a human soul master with a Bluesilver Grass martial soul. It requires great fortune. We can only cultivate if we are aided by the power of heaven and earth. I was baptized thrice by heavenly lightning. The power of the lightning spirit exists in my body, which has completely transformed me. I’m also aware of the person you’re talking about. She had the purest lineage, and was of royal blood. That individual you are talking about is her kid, who broke free from the restraints of this world and became a god. Speaking of her, I think it’s only right that I address her as ‘Your Majesty’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t expect that the Bluesilver Emperor had such a connection with Tang San’s mother. This was a good thing. This helped to close the gap between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like all of you have a deep history with my elder. My friend is the current sect leader of the Tang Sect, which was established by Tang San. Speaking of her, she’s a direct descendant of Tang San. It seems like the Tang Sect has a great affinity with your species!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? That’s actually the case? That’s great then.” The Bluesilver Emperor was feeling in better spirits now. After witnessing the immense spiritual power that Huo Yuhao unleashed, he was now very confident in this mission. Plant-type soul beasts were much more simple-minded compared to animal-type soul beasts. However, they were much more sensitive. From Huo Yuhao, he could sense kindness and justice. In addition, the Emperor Beast also played an important role in his decision. This was why he made his decision without thinking too much about it. Now that he heard this, he felt that his decision was the perfectly right choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, they were already high up in the air. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong picked up speed at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Flying was naturally not the Bluesilver Emperor’s strength. However, this wasn’t a major problem. Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong with one hand and the Bluesilver Emperor with his other hand. To give the Bluesilver Emperor even more confidence, Huo Yuhao increased his speed, and flew along the south of the Sun Moon Empire towards the Star Luo Empire. He was lightning quick, and rapidly reached supersonic speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the series of blows that had been dealt to them, the Sun Moon Empire withdrew all its defenses to Radiant City. It was even possible to claim that they had temporarily given up on their defenses in the outer cities. No more aerial surveillance soul tools were in place to carry out surveillance. It was a far smoother journey than Huo Yuhao had expected. Since they were far from Radiant City, they didn’t run into any trouble. Very soon, they entered the Star Luo Empire’s borders, and proceeded straight to Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A flag was flying high in the Heavenly Soul Empire. There was an army within the borders of the empire, but it was extremely large. On an extremely large flag, an image of a golden sun and silver moon was shining brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldiers were lined up in one single file, which extended for hundreds of kilometers in the Heavenly Soul Empire, or rather, the Sun Moon Empire. This was because the Heavenly Soul Empire had ceased to exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This army consisted of more than seven hundred thousand soldiers. Most of the Sun Moon Empire’s elite soldiers were here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From afar, the army looked like a giant dragon. The formation that it adopted was very complex, but it completely and perfectly covered the perimeter of a massive military base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even by scanning from above, it was impossible to tell how many soul formations there were in this base. The only certainty was that it was completely closed off to people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the border. However, it wasn’t just the border of the Heavenly Soul Empire. At the same time, it was the border of the Dou Ling and Star Luo Empires. At a corner of this border less than a hundred kilometers from where the army was stationed was Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a gold-red commander’s tent that was more than ten meters high in this base. More than a thousand people could fit into this tent without it being overcrowded. But at this moment, there were very few people in the tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was in the main seat. She was dressed in fiery-red armor. The phoenix image on her armor seemed real and alive. It wasn’t just ordinary armor. It was custom-made for her, and Kong Deming was the one who personally came up with this human-shaped soul tool. It wasn't used for attacking, but it was extremely effective for defensive purposes. Kong Deming told Ju Zi that even an Ultimate Douluo would need more than three strikes to overcome the defenses of this human-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi had six subordinates with her. The youngest one was already a middle-aged man. There were three elders among the six too. Every one of them exuded a strong aura. However, they didn’t move a single inch. Occasionally, they would glance at Ju Zi. They were all in admiration of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was holding onto a letter. Between the six of them, there was even a guy who was kneeling on one knee. The letter had been brought here by this man, an envoy from Radiant City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The letter wasn’t very long. She finished reading it very quickly. After she finished, she put it down, and her brow furrowed. After this, she stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she stood up, the six subordinates unwittingly took a step back, and opened up some space in the middle for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A person, especially someone who commanded a huge army, who held an important position for a long time would gradually develop some kind of might and dominance. This was the same for Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she became the War God Empress, her temperament completely changed. She became more reserved, but also more majestic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She slowly walked down. She kept thinking and pondering as she walked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t a single sound in the tent. Everyone was fixated on her, and they waited silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief moment, Ju Zi stopped and asked the envoy, “What were His Majesty’s instructions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The envoy said, “War God Empress, His Majesty said that everything will be decided by you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi squinted and nodded. She said, “Alright, you can leave. I’ll need to think of how to reply to His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” The envoy respectfully took his leave. Whoever waited between six Class 9 soul engineers would undoubtedly be subjected to immense pressure! He couldn’t wait to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi returned to her seat and said, “His Majesty has sent news that the empire was attacked by an unknown enemy. More than ten cities were plundered. Even Radiant City was attacked. The enemies used some kind of special method to sneak to a place near Radiant City before firing thousands of low-grade cannon shells. They even used a Class 9 soul cannon shell. The Imperial Palace was breached, and heavy damage was incurred. As the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was sent to search for these enemies and was not in the capital, these enemies weren’t caught in time. Their whereabouts are currently unknown. Preliminary investigations reveal that there were at least two soul engineer legions. Elder Kong said that these enemies might possibly be able to conceal themselves, and possess spatial abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Ju Zi’s words, the six Class 9 soul engineers’ expressions changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was the greatest fear of an army? It was that things weren’t stable at the back! Under normal conditions, things at the back could be stabilized by sending some reinforcements back. They were now in control of the Heavenly Soul Empire. Although they weren’t afraid of a lack of reinforcements, internal instability within the empire would affect proceedings at the front line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One elder who was standing at the left said, “Marshal, we must not let news of this spread. We must seal all information.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi nodded and said, “Whatever I say will stay between the seven of us. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder who had just spoken commented, “It’s unbelievable. It’s impossible!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi revealed a weird look on her face. “I have the same thought too. There are many aerial surveillance soul tools around the empire. Perhaps the three empires of the original Douluo Continent can come up with two soul engineer legions. However, they shouldn’t be too strong. Concealment and spatial abilities? This is a joke. Even our empire hasn’t come up with something like that. How did they manage to do so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An elder on the right said, “Marshal, perhaps it’s the doing of some powerful soul masters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi answered, “In Elder Kong’s analysis, he mentioned that powerful soul masters can conceal themselves using soul skills. However, if they are bringing along two soul engineer legions with three hundred heavy cannons, that is completely impossible. Currently, they are unsure of how the enemies managed to do so. However, the problem is that the enemies are unpredictable. It’s difficult to track them. This time, are we are the ones suffering because of a lack of surveillance and intelligence?”</span></p>
