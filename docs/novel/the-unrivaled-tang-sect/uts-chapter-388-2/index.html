I contemplated that if she died, I could be with you forever. My love for you ultimately has that bit of selfishness, but hers doesn’t. Her love for you is pure. She could sacrifice her own life for you without any hesitation at all, just like you had done for her.</span></p>

Therefore, I left, and I returned to the Great Star Dou Forest. I made a promise to myself that I would never see you again, and I would bury everything that happened between us in the past, and I would let bygones forever be bygones.</span></p>

I couldn’t forget about you</span></p>

This time, Dong’er isn’t by your side, and we aren’t inside the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley. This time, I will not lose to her. She is in a deep sleep, so there is no way she can compete with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er presented everything through her consciousness into Huo Yuhao’s mind, and he felt like his brain was in complete disarray. Even though his spirit was already exceptionally weak, every single word that Qiu’er uttered to him in his mind stunned and astonished him at an unimaginable level. Huo Yuhao didn’t realize that his spiritual power, which was burning up continuously before this, had actually stopped burning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er could feel saltiness flow into her mouth through the corners of her lips, and tears were already streaming down her face. However, she was still holding Huo Yuhao’s head as tightly as she could, so that his forehead was still closely pressed against hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qiu’er…”</span></p>

How I wish I could spend eternity with you like this! Thank you, Yuhao, because you have finally told me that there is space for me in your heart. In the end, I didn’t waste my experience of that love that humans have. Perhaps I have become more like a human at this point.</span></p>

Both Nan Qiuqiu and Nan Shuihui, who were protected beneath this golden light, realized to their surprise that their bodies had become like statues, and they couldn’t move a single inch.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s entire body became a little blurry, and she transformed into a ball of light that resembled the shape of a human. Afterward, she melted through the spot where her forehead was tightly pressed against Huo Yuhao’s forehead. She slowly melted into Huo Yuhao’s body, bit by bit…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, Qiu’er…” Huo Yuhao couldn’t shout, because his lips were still tightly locked with Wang Qiu’er’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu could clearly hear his shouts, those hysterical exclamations that came from his spiritual world, but they couldn’t do anything to stop this process, which was almost like a divine ceremony.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Streaks of light flowed into Huo Yuhao’s forehead continuously!</span></p>

She tenderly integrated herself into his body, and Huo Yuhao’s entire body was covered with golden hues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s own projection hovering above his head discreetly and quietly vanished. The raging spiritual flames were extinguished by those golden colors that flowed into him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s body continued flowing into Huo Yuhao’s body until only her virtual self remained. She still looked like she had, but she had become transparent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An enormous vertical eye stood as a backdrop behind her, and the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s projection flickered. However, the lion was looking up at the sky at this moment, and there was only satisfaction in her three eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t do this, Qiu’er!” Huo Yuhao felt as if lava was flowing through his body as heat surrounded every inch of him. All his weakness was replaced by strength at this moment, and he felt as if his entire being was fusing with another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea became plentiful once more as golden seawater flowed torrentially through it. Everything was brilliantly golden in color and exceptionally eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three projections glimmered and hovered above his spiritual sea one after another. They transformed, respectively, into a handsome youth and two ladies.</span></p>

One of the ladies wore a flowing jade-green dress, and there were tinges of unruliness and unyieldingness amid her beauty. The other lady bloomed with cold arrogance as if she were a winter sweet in harsh ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Concrete-material realm... a realm that not even I was able to reach after one million years of cultivation, but this realm has been realized at this moment,” the handsome youth muttered under his breath, and he went down on one knee in the next moment. He placed his right hand on his chest and closed his eyes, as if in prayer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other two ladies made the same motion, but they didn’t close their eyes. Their enchanting eyes were full of reverence and longing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no question that this handsome youth was the Skydream Iceworm, while the other two ladies were the Ice Empress and the Snow Empress.</span></p>

These three powerful beings weren’t excited or overjoyed about their transformations at all at this moment. Instead, they were filled with some indescribable emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">they knew what had just happened. In that moment, not even they knew how to extinguish Huo Yuhao’s burning spiritual flames with all their power and strength. However, Wang Qiu’er did it, and they were kneeling for her.</span></p>

Naturally, she couldn’t take these three powerful beings, who all had at least four hundred thousand years of cultivation each. But these three powerful beings knew that what Wang Qiu’er ha done for Huo Yuhao wasn’t something they could do, and so they knelt for her out of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sacrifice! Yes, only a Sacrifice could produce such tremendous changes.</span></p>

No matter how much her appearance, personality, and emotions resembled those of a human, she was still empirically a soul beast in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soul beasts always became soul rings after death, and human soul masters could absorb them once they reached their bottlenecks. Soul masters depended on soul rings to break through their bottlenecks.</span></p>

If a soul beast was willing to sacrifice itself to become a human’s soul ring, then its soul ring would fuse with the soul master at the highest possible level. However, this soul beast would lose its life in the process, and even its spirit would be completely integrated into that soul master’s spirit during this fusion process. The soul beast’s spirit would disappear forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fusion process that required death without any reciprocation at all was known as Sacrifice.</span></p>

His burning spiritual sea regained its original shape, and it was even more voluminous than before. His spiritual sea fully stepped into the concrete-material realm, and in terms of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual strength, he was now amongst the most powerful beings in the world.</span></p>

This most recent soul ring aligned itself at the back, but it had a peculiar golden color. It shone with faint rosy colors but retained the brilliance and dazzling elements of gold.</span></p>

His glossy white million-year soul ring, his orange-gold soul rings that represented the Snow Empress’ spirit, and this newest rose-gold soul ring made Huo Yuhao seem like he was a being that came from another world as if he wasn’t a soul master from the Douluo Continent.</span></p>

Violent and hysterical winds billowed through the air as mountains shook and the earth trembled at that moment, and lightning sparkled and flashed in the heavens. Rolling thunder echoed continuously, as though heaven and earth were about to shatter into a million pieces.</span></p>

The entire Great Star Dou Forest witnessed torrential rain that they wouldn’t see more than once in a century… but strangely, there wasn’t a single dark cloud in the sky. There was only a patch of blood-red color at the other end of this rainstorm, and the sky above the entire Great Star Dou Forest was stained this same blood-red.</span></p>
