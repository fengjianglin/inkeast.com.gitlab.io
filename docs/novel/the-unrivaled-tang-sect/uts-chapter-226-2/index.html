 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao had already laid down her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron and attempted to shake off Han Ruoruo’s Dazzling Golden True Body. However, her actions were to no avail as well, and in the end, both her and her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron were sent into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo had erupted with her seventh and eighth soul skills at the same time. She was a powerful Soul Douluo after all, and Shrek’s Seven Monsters didn’t stand any chance if she purely used her strength to overpower them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt trouble coming the moment she made her move. He still couldn’t find out where she really was, since Han Ruoruo’s spiritual power was comparable to his, and her soul power was so much stronger, in addition to the fact that she was using her martial soul true body. Huo Yuhao needed a cultivation of seven soul rings to suppress her with spiritual power at the least; anything else was impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stretched his arms out wide and hugged Wang Dong’er while his eyes lit up at the same time. Another pair of huge dark blue eyes sparkled along with his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady’s petite frame instantly enlarged, and the Snow Empress’ virtual projection appeared behind Huo Yuhao’s back. The water around the Sea God’s Island began to ripple torrentially after it appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air grew moist as enormous snowflakes drifted down from the sky. Huo Yuhao gradually masked his own figure among all those snowflakes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice had finally descended upon the world once more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the fusion between the Ice Empress’ Domain of Perpetual Ice and the Snow Empress’ Snowy Dance of the Brilliant Sun. Both were incredibly powerful soul skills in their own right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The temperature across the entire battleground began to plummet. Wu Ming had long since backed out of the battlefield, and was back to normal, but her expression changed in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because she was a fire-type soul master, so her perception of this extreme chill was far more conspicuous. She could clearly feel how low the battlefield’s temperature had dropped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei, Xiao Xiao, and Jiang Nannan had been thrown out of the circle after they were tossed into the air one after another. This was a practice battle after all, and Han Ruoruo definitely didn’t want to hurt them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s figures vanished within the tremendous patches of ice and frost, and even He Caitou’s disappeared as well. The ground was covered with gold and silver circles of light in the same instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Streak after streak of dual-colored light surged up from the ground and stirred the waltzing snowflakes in the sky, attempting to find the three of them. However, just like how Huo Yuhao couldn’t determine Han Ruoruo’s location, Han Ruoruo couldn’t find Huo Yuhao either, not within his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming’s expression was a little sullen. She knew that she had already lost to Huo Yuhao in terms of elements, the palm she took before this was based on that elemental difference. Her Golden Crow Primordial Fire was strong, but it was nowhere near as extreme as Huo Yuhao’s ice and snow. Her element had been overpowered, and the formidable chill from that simple-looking strike had defeated her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go, Ruoruo!” While Wu Ming’s despondence was extremely ephemeral, her mentality was very strong, and she immediately began to cheer for Han Ruoruo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gold and silver circles started to transform on the ground. They gradually dissipated, and everything changed into horizontal patterns of light. These patterns began to ripple immediately afterwards, and they swept up into the sky like tidal waves. The turbulent ice and snow was stirred up even more vigorously, and the air was filled with dense, extremely powerful soul power undulations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ice and snow that were originally concentrated inside the Sparring Arena were whipped into pieces, and they gradually drifted into the air outside. Han Ruoruo had unleashed her sixth soul skill, Golden Wave. This was an area-of-effect control-type soul skill, and its main function was to dispel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She naturally couldn’t dispel Huo Yuhao’s domain, but she could still dispel the ice and snow that Huo Yuhao had formed inside this domain with his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation immediately descended into an impasse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was alright if she couldn’t find Huo Yuhao, as Han Ruoruo had absolute confidence that he would still be the first to drop if this stalemate was allowed to continue. He was only a Soul King after all, and their cultivations were ultimately still worlds apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Han Ruoruo’s Golden Wave meant that Huo Yuhao’s snowflakes were also within the area of effect. This combat practice would be over the moment she discovered Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ve lost, senior sister.” Huo Yuhao didn’t attempt to keep this up, and his voice resonated through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was almost like an instant reaction to opportunity. Han Ruoruo’s Dazzling Golden True Body immediately pinpointed his location when his voice rang out, and her Golden Wave transformed back into the Golden Skysurge and barreled towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a dark blue streak flickered once in midair, and a crack slashed through her Golden Skysurge. Three snowflakes rapidly drifted down outside the Sparring Arena as they revealed their human forms: Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong’er, and He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s face was a little pale, and it was apparent that this was caused by expending too much soul power. The ice and snow swiftly disappeared from the mountaintop, while the gold and silver colors receded Han Ruoruo stood all by herself in center of the Sparring Arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she didn’t have the look of elation that she was supposed to have after certain victory; there was only astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… you can break through my Golden Skysurge?” Huo Yuhao’s sword naturally wasn’t able to break through completely, but this was only because there was a tremendous gap between their cultivations. Han Ruoruo was absolutely certain that her Golden Skysurge wouldn’t have been able to withstand Huo Yuhao’s dark blue sword radiance if they had the same cultivation. That sword had possessed both extreme chill and incredible sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao forced a laugh and said, “I did no such thing. You’re too powerful, senior sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Han Ruoruo was too powerful. She had practically defeated Shrek’s Seven Monsters with a single strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo, Wu Ming, and Chu Qingtian were still shaken by the Shrek’s Seven Monsters’ prowess. However, the seven of them seemed a little dull… they had been defeated, after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what a gap in ability and cultivation meant, and perhaps also what a gap in battle experience meant. Han Ruoruo had been one versus six, but they had had no chance at all. Wu Ming was only knocked out because her element was countered, and she wasn’t familiar with Huo Yuhao’s abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The temperature of the Sparring Arena had dropped from all the ice and snow strewn across the ground. The teachers that came from elsewhere to watch were both stunned and slack-jawed. They came over to emphasize the importance of safety, and they inspected the grounds to ensure that they hadn’t been overly damaged before they walked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi grumbled, “Senior sister Han, you’re too brutal. I didn’t even get to use my real abilities before I was thrown out of the fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo snapped, “You didn’t get to use your abilities? You managed to swap Ming’er away. What’s up with you, Ming’er? You couldn’t even last a little while longer?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming was even more despondent than Xu Sanshi was. “I couldn’t take it, Ruoruo! I don’t even know what soul skill Huo Yuhao used when he hit me with his palm, but my martial soul true body was instantly dispelled. If he hadn’t withdrawn his soul power in time, I might’ve been severely wounded. His Ultimate Ice is powerful… his element completely overpowered mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo’s gaze changed a little when she turned towards Huo Yuhao again. Han Ruoruo hadn’t felt comfortable inside his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice either. She was fettered by the low temperature and extreme chill even under the effects of her Dazzling Golden True Body. The snowflakes that fell from the sky possessed formidable offensive strength at the same time, and she had consumed a lot of soul power. Not to mention the stunning sword that sliced open her Golden Skysurge at the end, which left an exceptionally strong impression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop complaining, everyone.” Wang Yan came over with a smile on his face. “This sparring match was short, but it was spectacular. Bei Bei, Yuhao, you guys lost the fight, but you guys were still glorious in defeat. You guys have to know that Ruoruo is considered one of the strongest students in the inner courtyard, and the cultivation difference isn’t something that can be made up with numbers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This was a practice battle after all, so it’s natural for everyone to feel a little restrained. You guys have already adjusted extremely well. It seems like the two years that the few of you have spent apart didn’t diminish your teamwork or your tacit understandings. In fact, it was Han Ruoruo, Wu Ming, and Qingtian who were lacking rapport. Ruoruo, you underestimated your opponents from the very beginning, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo blushed a little when she met Wang Yan’s intense gaze, and nodded slightly. She had indeed underestimated her adversaries; the gap in their cultivations was simply too great, and she possessed a martial soul true body while they didn’t, which meant a world of difference. Otherwise, assault-type soul masters would never make the first move in a group battle; it was always the control-type soul masters who unleashed their soul skills first. If she shared a better coordination or chemistry with Wu Ming, then Wu Ming wouldn’t have landed herself in that awkward situation.</span></p>

If you had used your Lightning Transformation the moment Ming’er was swapped away by that Mysterious Underworld Displacement, she might have been able to escape the soul skills that came right after.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian nodded as Wu Ming shot a fierce glare in his direction. It was clear that she wasn’t very pleased with his performance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yan turned towards Wu Ming and said, “Actually, you did a good job. A fight between soul masters means both sides must try their best to suppress each other by maximizing their respective strengths and fortes. However, you have to be clear about what’s up with your opponents. Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice isn’t a secret, and I know you wanted to fight against it in your heart. The fact that it can be described as an Ultimate element already proves his elemental advantage. However, even I didn’t expect Huo Yuhao to be able to break your martial soul true body. Still, your defeat isn’t unfair at all. Even though you’re a Soul Sage, it’s not easy to defend yourself against six people barraging you at the same time. The only problem was with your mentality. You must have thought that the others wouldn’t be able to do anything to you if you unleashed your martial soul true body, so breaking through their siege wouldn’t be too difficult, and you could possibly turn the tables on them instead. If you had opted to break through their encirclement instead of facing them head-on, you might have had a different outcome.”</span></p>
