 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black gaping hole in the sky, which was created by Di Tian, now had a layer of white light on it. All the spatial energy had suddenly been isolated by the white light. It was almost as if the opening was now sealed, and was no longer able to release its energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was only able to stabilize his body after flying backward for close to a thousand meters. However, his backward movement had helped him absorb some of the force exerted on him by Di Tian. On the other hand, Di Tian’s body was now covered in a layer of thick frost. The frost only shattered and fell after he shook his body intensely, and only fully disintegrated after it landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, Huo Yuhao did not gain the upper hand. Compared to Di Tian, his abilities were still considered relatively undeveloped. However, every observer present placed their hands over their mouths subconsciously. What had they just witnessed? They had just seen a human, who was just a little more than twenty years old, block Di Tian’s blow directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian was frowning as he reflected on the interaction earlier. No one had a deeper impression of the collision than him. Even though the frost on the surface of his body had shattered, he could still feel how retarded the circulation of his blood and soul power had become. This was caused by the extreme temperatures of the frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was actually able to seal my spatial energy and inflict his Ultimate Ice on my body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the meantime, Huo Yuhao was not feeling too well after the collision. Purple-black lines were flickering on his body. However, they quickly faded away under the jade blue light released by the Icy War God’s Armor. No one knew his current state because his body was concealed by the human-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao suddenly vanished after his figure faded away like a mirage. Even the Beast God, who had been focusing on Huo Yuhao, could only sense a slight distortion in the air before losing his target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A worried expression started to form on Di Tian’s face. He had finally concluded that he had underestimated Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This young man was a lot more powerful than he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right. He must have succeeded. If not, there would be no way that he could have blocked my attack without having first attained the Ultimate Douluo rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yin Yang Complement technique. He was actually able to form his second soul core using the Yin Yang Complement technique with a human body. I can’t let this go on. I must stop his development no matter what. If not, it will be impossible to control him in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Beast God took a deep breath before raising the Dark Dragon Sword in his hand. Following which, he closed his eyes. He had no intent to kill Huo Yuhao. However, he had to take him away today and imprison him within the Great Star Dou Empire at all costs. The Beast God planned to destroy the power which Huo Yuhao had painstakingly cultivated, and leave him and the power of destiny within the Great Star Dou Forest forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao’s body reappeared again, he appeared behind Di Tian. The Icy War God’s Armor instantly released a brilliant jade blue smoke behind it as it sped up and carried Huo Yuhao forward by nearly five kilometers. Huo Yuhao was getting nearer to the Sun Moon Empire troops.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit!” Ju Zi exclaimed as she ordered, “All soul tool deployment areas, get ready!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, she had to ensure her troops were ready for what could happen next. Huo Yuhao was undoubtedly trying to bring whatever destruction his clash with Di Tian would create to the Sun Moon Empire military camp instead of Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that Huo Yuhao was able to withstand a single blow from Di Tian meant that he was pretty close to the level of an Ultimate Douluo, even if he was not quite there yet. If Di Tian—the current strongest individual in the world—were to clash with him above the Sun Moon Empire’s military camp, it would probably bring apocalyptic destruction to the troops and their equipment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian seemed to be acting a little strange. He was not going after Huo Yuhao. Instead, he was just wielding his Dark Dragon Sword with a single hand, and standing there as though he had been frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao was still running. With his cultivation, it only required him to sprint a few moments to cover tens of kilometers. Before long, the Sun Moon Empire’s troops were beneath him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless virtual images appeared from Huo Yuhao’s body as he disappeared. He only left a distorted glow in his place after his disappearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had executed his Spiritual Interference Domain. He wanted to make sure no one beneath him was able to pinpoint his exact location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul tool deployment areas were unable to attack at this instant. They could only watch as their surveillance soul tools tried their best to locate where exactly he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, Di Tian suddenly made his move. His movement was extremely simple and elegant as he flipped in mid-air before wielding his Dark Dragon Sword with his two hands instead of one. The gigantic sword suddenly released a blinding purple-black sword light in the air. However, the sword light merely appeared for a short while before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was strange to see Di Tian’s attack disappear after he seemed to have made an all-out slash in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the entire sky began to contort and twist as the dense purple-black clouds which were hanging over the land beneath them started to disappear. The sun reappeared and continued its irradiation of sunlight on the land beneath it. However, no one could sense the warmth from its rays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan felt as if his heart had skipped a beat at that instant. Di Tian, who had just completed his slashing motion, seemed to have returned to his formerly calm and collected state. However, he had turned around as he gazed in the direction of the Sun Moon Empire’s military camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao reappeared. However, this time around, he was no longer in mid-air, but on the ground. He was standing inside the Sun Moon Empire’s military camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was standing there quietly, as though he had sensed something. His hands were wielding the dagger in his hand as he looked around warily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding soldiers were able to notice his presence instantly. However, no one dared to confront him. In fact, even the surrounding soul engineers did not possess the courage to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of them were foolish enough to believe that they could challenge a person who had just managed to withstand a blow from Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature of the air around Huo Yuhao plunged instantly. Any place within a thousand meters of him was now permeated with a chilling aura. The entire Icy War God's Armor which he was wearing had now taken on a jade blue color. The Morning Dew Dagger which was in his hand was now emanating a radiant glow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A chilling current surged within the white icy mist. A figure slowly formed behind Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This figure had long golden hair. It was floating behind Huo Yuhao as it revealed a smile on its face. One of its pupils was black, while the one was white.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a grunt as he suddenly waved his Morning Dew Dagger upwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This action was extremely succinct, but it contained a lot of force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the meantime, Ju Zi's orders were being disseminated across her army. "All soul tool deployment areas and linked defensive soul tools, activate at full power. Do not hold back."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire was fortunate to have had their soul engineers ready to set up their soul tool deployment areas. All of their linked defensive and offensive soul tools were already charged and ready for use.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi's orders could be implemented right away after they were broadcasted and communicated through sound amplifying soul tools and communication soul tools.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several radiant barriers quickly formed above the military camps as they enveloped the large volume of space beneath them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, an inconspicuous crack suddenly formed in front of Huo Yuhao. Following which, a purple light flickered from within it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao moved his Morning Dew Dagger and managed to block the blow from the purple light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Clingggg!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bright metallic sound echoed in the air. Huo Yuhao’s body was vibrating intensely, as though he had just been electrocuted. The insane amount of destructive energy spread to every single corner of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, his two Yin Yang Complement soul cores seemed to have stopped working. In fact, Huo Yuhao found himself incapable of thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hummmm!” The Morning Dew Dagger released a bright humming sound as its blade began to tremble. In fact, it was trembling so fast that it appeared to be in possession of multiple blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Multiple deep blue whirlpools began to form on the Icy War God’s Armor. The ground beneath Huo Yuhao started to vibrate as those whirlpools started to fall to the ground from Huo Yuhao’s armor. After landing on the ground, those whirlpools began to expand furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Huo Yuhao felt as though everything inside him had stopped. Following which, he could sense the frightening power being channeled into his body by the Dark Dragon Sword tearing up everything within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sensation felt horrible. In fact, it was unbelievably frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two figures started to appear behind him.</span></p>

They were also a sun and a moon. However, while Di Tian had a black sun and a purple moon, Huo Yuhao’s sun was golden, and his moon was a brilliant blue.&nbsp;</span></p>
