Segregation, control and defense. Your Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron is indeed a powerful tool soul.” Wang Dong complimented. An increase in Xiao Xiao’s abilities was equivalent to an increase in their team’s strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had the lowest cultivations among everyone in Shrek’s Seven Monsters. It was impossible for them not to have the desire to catch up with their seniors. However, the three of them possessed twin martial souls and the greatest potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao laughed and looked at Huo Yuhao, “Monitor, show us how powerful the fellow that almost destroyed my arm is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was still a little petrified as she mentioned the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Right Palm Bone. If Huo Yuhao hadn’t absorbed its strength away, her right arm would have been gone by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and lifted his right arm. As a dark golden radiance flashed, 5 sharp claws that resembled blades extended from his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was rather difficult to fuse with this Darkgolden Terrorclaw Right Palm Bone. However, it’s indeed different from an ordinary soul bone. There are 2 forms to it. The first is the ordinary form just like what we’re seeing now. The other form is during a soul skill attack. Take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao chose a rock that was as big as a millstone and threw it up. He then slashed his right hand towards the rock. The rock was cut into several pieces without even making a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pieces of the rock landed on the ground. Both Xiao Xiao and Wang Dong rushed to take a look at them. The rock had been divided into many pieces, and the cuts were very sleek.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao stared wide-eyed, “This, this is like cutting tofu! It’s really sharp.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled, “You shouldn’t feel indebted to me now that you’ve seen this. I’ve obtained an extremely good soul bone for myself too! The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear is able to become one of the most dangerous soul beasts because of its Darkgolden Terrorclaw.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao shook her head and said seriously, “It’s different. Monitor, I know it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled slightly and said, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. I shall show you its soul skill form.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze straightened as he spoke, and the terrorclaws on his right palm waved in the distant air. An intense dark gold radiance shot out, and the powerful terrorclaws changed into 3 meter-long dark golden claw projections before they clawed into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No dirt or gravel was displaced from the ground, but five 3 meter-long scratch marks appeared. Even the air seemed to have been clawed. After Huo Yuhao finished clawing, there was still an echo left in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao teased Xiao Xiao, “Do you want to test out my Darkgolden Terrorclaws with your Cauldron’s Might?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine. Thanks.” Xiao Xiao shook her head hurriedly, and quickly put her Threelives Soulcrush Cauldron away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong asked, “Yuhao, what’s the rate of depletion of your soul power when using this Darkgolden Terrorclaw?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered, “It’s still fine, as it only comes from a two thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. There’s not much depletion in its original form. It’s just like a part of me – nothing different from my hand. The depletion is greater when I’m using the soul skill. It depletes around 30% of my soul power every time I use it. Elder Xuan was right. I can feel this right palm bone absorbing my strength slowly after it has fused with me. It seems like it really can evolve.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong said, “Let’s go. Let’s enter the Star Dou Forest again and hope our luck continues. We’ll find a suitable soul beast for your third soul ring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure.” Huo Yuhao nodded. Becoming a soul elder was necessary for every powerful soul master, and it was also the first major barrier in the development of every soul master. For those whose soul power and martial soul were weaker, they were destined to be unable to overcome this barrier in their entire life. After crossing this barrier, a soul master was no longer in the beginner stage anymore. He would have reached the intermediate stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the three of them were not ordinary soul elders, they still had to make this breakthrough in their soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three proceeded in the direction of Star Dou Forest after they packed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They covered the tens of miles quickly. Huo Yuhao continued to lead them while Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao followed behind him. The three of them seemed familiar with Star Dou Forest as they entered it again. Huo Yuhao initiated his Spiritual Detection Sharing and they proceeded much faster than the first time they had entered the forest. They covered around 10 miles in less than an hour, and started to search for a suitable soul beast for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Huo Yuhao knew that it wouldn’t be easy to find a spiritual-type soul beast that suited him, he didn’t think it would be that difficult either. Over the next 10 days, they circled almost half of Star Dou Forest. But they didn’t manage to find a suitable soul beast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did encounter spiritual-type soul beasts, but these soul beasts were either too weak or not old enough. He couldn’t possibly fuse with ten year or hundred year soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their strategy also changed during this period of time. Their original strategy was not to rile any soul beasts, but they wouldn’t cave in when they met soul beasts that attacked them actively. In this way, they prevented a lot of trouble. However, this didn’t manage to attract higher-level soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they did benefit slightly from their 10 days in the forest. They had to remain on alert in the Star Dou Forest as they might be in danger at any time. Under such conditions, they &nbsp;started to assimilate their experience in the tournament and understanding during their closed-door cultivation, and coordinated better and better with one another. Thousand years soul beasts no longer posed any threat to them. Of course, this was only if they met one of such soul beasts. They could only escape if they met a bunch of soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In these 10 days of training, their mindset, attainments and the development of their potential were all very important to them. Elder Xuan didn’t appear in these 10 days, as if he wasn’t following them at all. He allowed them to move freely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao finally understood why he hadn’t been made a core disciple of Shrek Academy. It was too difficult for his Spirit Eyes to obtain a suitable soul ring. His good fortune seemed to have ended after he hunted the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Night had fallen again. The three of them retreated from Star Dou Forest and rested at a small hill 30 miles away. They slept in two small tents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, we can’t continue on like this! We’ve circled almost half of Star Dou Forest, but we’ve only seen a few spiritual-type soul beasts. Even then, none of them were suitable for you.” Wang Dong furrowed his brows as he looked at Huo Yuhao flipping grilled meat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao flipped the grilled meat skillfully and said, “It’s indeed difficult to find a soul beast that’s suitable for me. It’s already rare to find a spiritual-type soul beast. It’s even more difficult to find one that’s suitable for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao said, “Monitor, why don’t we go deeper in? If we go further in by another 10 miles, I believe the quality of soul beasts that we’ll encounter will be higher.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was silent. Although they knew that Elder Xuan was protecting them secretly, they were all very proud as the new generation of Shrek’s Seven Monsters. None of them wanted Elder Xuan to intervene unless there was a special situation. They could naturally sense their improvement in all aspects after these 10 days of training. This was especially evident for Xiao Xiao, who was able to use her Cauldron’s Might more freely. She should be able to determine the outcome of a battle with one sweep of her Cauldron’s Might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong nodded and said, “I agree. Yuhao, you don’t have to think so much. We should be able to deal with a ten thousand year soul beast with our combined strength if we meet one, or at least we’ll have no problem preserving our lives. Even if we venture a further 10 miles in, we’ll still be very far from the center of the forest. We’ll just see fewer hundred year soul beasts. It won’t be too dangerous with your Spiritual Detection Sharing’s ability to warn us and if we’re careful enough. In addition, greater pressure will also be beneficial for us. Elder Xuan hasn’t appeared, not even to eat your grilled meat, because he wants to give us more training. I feel that our soul power and live experiences have improved significantly during this period of time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Alright, we’ll go deeper in then. However, I have to put this across first. If we meet a ten thousand year soul beast, we have to leave the area immediately after the battle.” As the team leader, he had to take responsibility for everyone’s safety. They could venture deeper in with their current abilities. Huo Yuhao didn’t persist any further, since Elder Xuan was secretly protecting them too.</span></p>

The temporary bottleneck wouldn’t affect his cultivation, and it would increase accordingly when he obtained his soul ring. This was said to be confirmed by one of Shrek Academy’s founders, a teacher known by the title of Grandmaster. This Grandmaster’s research on the 10 core competitive powers in the world of soul masters also played a huge role in erecting Shrek Academy’s foundation as the continent’s top academy.</span></p>

He opened his eyes quickly. When he opened his eyes, a golden light shone in the small tent.</span></p>
