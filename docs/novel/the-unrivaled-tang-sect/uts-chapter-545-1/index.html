 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was probably Huo Yuhao’s least confident attempt in fusing with a Spirit, apart from the time when he had fused the Snow Empress. However, it was also his most important fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Low-pitched incantations echoed in the seawater. Huo Yuhao released gentle spiritual undulations from his body. These undulations spread towards the Mermaid on the Frigid Jade Bed, releasing a gentle aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mermaid was deep in sleep. Her soul had been crushed and the spiritual power in her spiritual sea was close to drying up. Her soul power had already ceased to exist, and her life energy was almost fully drained. Everything pointed to the fact that she was about to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was still very beautiful in this state. Her giant tail still shone with a dim, golden glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was also dim gold. As he recited incantations, his spiritual power engulfed her body and covered her in a layer of gold. It also seemed to give her a layer of life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soft and gentle incantations echoed continually. Huo Yuhao’s body also turned golden. An ethereal projection of a hexagram array appeared underneath his feet. He was well into the recitation of his incantations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong, the Princess of the Sea and the others were all watching intently from one side. In this aquatic world, there wasn’t any danger from the outside world. The real danger only came from the fusion process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one knew what the result would be, but they were all praying for success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly, a strange aura came from the sleeping Mermaid. This aura manifested as streaks of golden light. These streaks of light were released from her head. As they were released, they crystallized, and dense soul undulations also appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea grabbed the hand of her eldest daughter tightly. The streaks of golden light were the remnants of the soul energy of her youngest daughter’s soul. Once they dissipated, any indication of her youngest daughter’s life would cease to exist. She would be truly dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao appeared as calm as could be. He gently moved his hands in the air to fit the rhythm of his incantations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul energy released from the Mermaid started to gather under his control. Slowly, it took a humanoid appearance of a human. It was the appearance of the Mermaid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that she had no expression right now. It didn’t seem any different to her sleeping self.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea was very tense when she saw this. She knew that Huo Yuhao’s compression of her soul energy using his spiritual power could only last for some time. Once he let go, her daughter’s soul energy couldn’t possibly return to her body. This also meant that there was no room for regret now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao wasn’t going to back out. He only had one chance, and there wasn’t any room for failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s voice became more high-pitched as he recited the incantations. His Eye of Destiny also completely lit up, and a beam of golden light shot out of it, striking the soul of the Mermaid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gentle soul undulations started to become more intense. The Mermaid’s soul started to gradually open her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she opened her eyes, she immediately revealed her emotions. She was even very emotional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fear, it was extreme fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was completely at a loss. She was so fearful that there was only terror, sorrow, fear, and all other types of negative emotions in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s heart sank. She clearly knew how difficult it was to fuse with a Spirit under such conditions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook a little, but he didn’t stop reciting the incantations. His eyes were still fixated on the Mermaid, as he tried to communicate with her on a spiritual level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mermaid’s soul was struggling intensely to break free. Her powerful soul energy could be felt. She was struggling as hard as she could to destroy and break free from the restraints she had been placed under.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she would forever leave this world if she managed to do so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the Princess of the Sea and her daughter were very anxious. The Princess of the Sea really wanted to comfort her daughter! However, she couldn’t do so. She could do so at all! Right now, the sleeping Mermaid could only see Huo Yuhao, as she was stimulated by his spiritual power. She couldn’t see anyone else, and was completely immersed in his incantations. Only Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power surrounded her, and he was the only one trying to comfort her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, no, no!” The Mermaid was struggling as hard as she could. The entire contract was shaking tremendously. Huo Yuhao’s hexagram array even started to crack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spiritual power of this Mermaid was very strong, even stronger than that of her elder sister. Even though only a part of her soul remained, she was still resisting so hard that Huo Yuhao was about to cave in. After all, he had completely let himself go as he recited the incantations. He had no ability to resist at all. He was completely subjected to any impact inflicted on him by the other party’s soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fresh blood flowed from Huo Yuhao’s mouth, nose and ears. At this point, they were just pitting their spiritual power against each other. No, they weren’t fighting at all. Rather, Huo Yuhao was trying to persuade the Mermaid. If he couldn’t do so, he would undoubtedly suffer a major backlash. In addition to that, he would fail completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong clenched her fists. At this point, no one could help Huo Yuhao. It was just a spiritual interaction. Furthermore, it had nothing to do with the strength of one’s spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such an equal contract could only be fulfilled if both parties were willing. Otherwise, failure was inevitable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was holding on as well as he could right now. This was why he was suffering from a backlash. Otherwise, he could have given up on the contract earlier, and allowed the Mermaid’s soul to dissipate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how could he possibly do that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea could no longer bear to watch. From the condition Huo Yuhao was in, she could tell that he was already trying his best. He couldn’t do any better.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My little girl, are your really fated to die like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was also becoming more and more dejected as time passed. The negative emotions experienced by this Mermaid were much worse than he had expected. He couldn’t sense any positive emotions coming from her at all. Her negative emotions were raging. When she felt that she was a human, she immediately resisted with all her might. Under this circumstance, hanging on even for a while longer took a huge toll on him, much less completing the equal contract.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What should I do? What should I do?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tried to think of various solutions, but this was his first time experiencing such a situation! What kind of appropriate solution could he think of? He could only try his best to last a little longer, and hope that this Mermaid would experience a change in her emotions. That would give him an opportunity to explain himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, things didn’t go the way he wanted. Not only did her emotions not show any signs of changing, but they even became more frenzied. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea started to show little cracks as it clashed with her spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t hold on. I think I really can’t hold on anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly to himself. He couldn’t use his life to exchange for more time! There were still five other Spirits in his spiritual sea. Once there was critical damage to his spiritual sea, his five other Spirits would also be critically hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sighed to himself. Although he was very unwilling, he also recognized that there was no other way. He could only choose to give up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The contract was at its peak right now. The souls of both parties were starting to interact. Even though the Mermaid greatly ostracized Huo Yuhao, their souls still had a chance to interact under an equal contract.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was going to be his only try. If this Mermaid didn’t show any signs of improving after they interacted, Huo Yuhao would have to end this fusion. Otherwise, he might suffer irreparable injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once their souls interacted, everything happened according to Huo Yuhao’s expectations. The Mermaid’s soul immediately jumped away in fear, as if she had been greatly shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, it’s still not working. Do I really have to give up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao was feeling hopeless, the Mermaid’s soul actually calmed down for a moment. Following this, she seemed to be in a slight daze, and just stared at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What? She’s no longer attacking me? She’s no longer trying to break free from me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was also a little perplexed. He had tried so hard earlier, but didn’t achieve anything. Why was it that things were on the brink of changing now that he was about to give up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a layer of white light appeared within Huo Yuhao’s soul. This layer of white light wasn’t under Huo Yuhao’s control. Then, it separated from his soul and drifted in mid-air.</span></p>
