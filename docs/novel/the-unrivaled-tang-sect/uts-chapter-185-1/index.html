He appeared very fierce as he looked at Huo Yuhao and Na Na. “I shall let you feel what’s it like to be devoured by thousands of souls. Your spirits will be torn apart and your bodies will become my puppets. Die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was horrified.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this the Myriad Soul Banner that Elder Yi mentioned?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Yi had once mentioned that a necromancers’ control of undead creatures was restricted to a specific domain due to their limited spiritual power. However, they could use tools to enhance their control and transformation of spirits. The Myriad Soul Banner was such a tool. He mentioned that an extremely cultivated Myriad Soul Banner could contain tens of thousands of spirits. Against enemies, the avenging spirits could be commanded to launch large-scale attacks. All living matter affected by these avenging spirits would become carriers of these spirits. They would quickly be roped in as part of their Undead Legion. Once the bodies of these undead creatures were destroyed, their spirits would return to the banner and they would continue to devour the spirits of the living to evolve. It was rumored that they were as resistant as Gods when they evolved to their most highest form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Myriad Soul Banner was a tool that offended the heavens. Once a necromancer managed to successfully create it, he would definitely suffer the scourge of the heavens. It was like the negative repercussions of the Light of Destiny—it was only a matter of time before he was jinxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this evil soul master so strong that he could possess a Myriad Soul Banner</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was shocked, Huo Yuhao still naturally wouldn’t allow these avenging spirits to attack him. A ring of formless spiritual ripples spread; it was Spiritual Interference. The avenging spirits were instantly affected by his spiritual power, and they descended into chaos as they flew like headless flies. Their pathetic cries resonated throughout the underground hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s astonishment was soon replaced by composure. Through Spiritual Detection and Spiritual Interference, he realized that there weren’t that many of these avenging spirits, at most four or five hundred of them. In addition, each of them was very weak individually. They were completely different from the powerful avenging spirits that Electrolux described, which couldn’t be overcome simply with his Spiritual Interference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Holy Ghost didn’t expect that the Holy Ghost Flag would be rendered ineffective. This flag didn’t belong to him, it was the most important treasure of the elder from the Sub-Altar. Not only was it a Class 7 soul tool, but it also had to be used by an evil soul master skilled at controlling spirits. In the Sub-Altar, only he and that elder could control it. It was left in the Sub-Altar as a precaution. The elder once said that the Holy Ghost Flag was sufficient as long as the opponent wasn’t an eight-ringed soul douluo. In addition, the Great Holy Ghost was equipped with powerful evil soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he controlled this flag, he didn’t use any soul skills. He only burned his six soul rings using a special method that belonged to evil soul masters. This provided him with enough spiritual power to control the flag. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out fresh blood into the air, which instantly turned into a blood-red avenging spirit in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The avenging spirit blew apart as it flew into the air, staining a large portion of the other avenging spirits. Suddenly, the powers of the avenging spirits soared, and Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Interference couldn’t fend them off any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao was already muttering an incantation when these amped avenging spirits appeared. His golden eyes turned grey, even his Eye of Destiny. Behind him, an elderly-looking figure subtly appeared, and there seemed to be an ancient voice chanting along with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he were alone, he wouldn’t hesitate to attack and get rid of the Great Holy Ghost before snatching his flag. The crisis would be averted as simple as that. However, Na Na was behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The avenging spirits had become extremely ferocious under the Great Holy Ghost’s command. He couldn’t ensure her safety in the slightest if he rushed forward to attack. Dealing with these avenging spirits first was essential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pointed toward the sky with his right index finger and shouted mightily, “Purify these stained spirits.” A ring of white light was released from the Eye of Destiny. His boundless spiritual sea started to surge with waves, and his immense spiritual power was unleashed under the guidance of his incantation. The spiritual power was converted into a purifying force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood-red lights from the bodies of the avenging spirits disappeared as the white light passed. They were forced to stay still in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the white light spread to every corner of the underground hall, all of the vicious avenging spirits were dyed white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that Light of Purification reached the Great Holy Ghost, he let out a pathetic scream. Black smoke rose ceaselessly from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He shouted pathetically, “This, this is a force that destroys spirits! Who, who are you? Only the Holy Emperor possesses such strength! You’re also an evil soul master, you’re also… but why did you…?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t continue any further as he spoke till here. That was because a huge figure had already arrived in front of him. His neck was grabbed by black, bony claws, and he was lifted up. It was an attack from the converted Second Holy Ghost’s skull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the eyes of the black skull were dancing with dim-golden flames. They were a type of spiritual fire that carried a shred of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual awareness. The Second Holy Ghost had been completely purified, and submitted to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The avenging spirits in mid-air appeared to be very weird. They weren’t nearly as ferocious as before, and they slowly formed corporeal faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me, what kind of organization is the Holy Ghost Church? Where is the Main Altar?” The black skull lifted the Great Holy Ghost in front of Huo Yuhao. After being cleansed by the Light of Purification, the Great Holy Ghost’s cultivation had fallen to half its original level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Holy Ghost was in a daze as he looked at Huo Yuhao, “Holy Son? Are you the reincarnation of the Holy Son? Holy Son, you should find the Holy Emperor. He’ll help us rule this world! Only those with holy powers like us are qualified to rule!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. “Answer my question.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Great Holy Ghost revealed a weird smile on his face. “Holy Son, the Holy Emperor will find you one day. When that happens, it may be the best opportunity for us Holy Ghosts to rule. Long live the Holy Emperor!” As he spoke, his eyes dimmed, and his entire body turned into ash, which easily escaped the claw’s grasp before dispersing into the air. There wasn’t even a corpse left. Everything was very strange. The Holy Ghost Flag also fell in front of Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao picked the flag up, but quickly crushed it with his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na was dumbfounded. Although she knew that Huo Yuhao was very strong, she had already gone feeble long ago when she heard the cries of the avenging spirits, and couldn’t exert any soul power herself. At that point in time, she had thought that everything was over, and despaired. However, she was shocked by what followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned the tide right in front of her. She wasn’t even clear on how he had managed to pull it off. The crisis was destroyed, the Great Holy Ghost was dead, and the skull converted from the Second Holy Ghost was being controlled by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything changed too suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Na Na.” Na Na was jolted to her senses after Huo Yuhao shouted her name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly, find your parents. You don’t have much time. The evil stains on these avenging spirits have been cleansed under my Purification Spell. Once they’re completely cleansed, they will be purified and rise to the heavens. If you have anything to say to them, tell them quickly. I’ll be waiting for you outside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao was already headed outside, and quickly escaped. It was very weird, as the Holy Servants didn’t react even though the commotion inside the underground hall was quite loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the underground hall, Huo Yuhao bumped into eight of them. Their abilities were greatly inferior to Na Na’s. They collapsed under Huo Yuhao’s surprise attack, they didn’t stand a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Great Holy Ghost and Second Holy Ghost are both dead, while the Sub-Altar has been destroyed. The spirits of your loved ones are being purified. If all of you still want to see them again, quickly go inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stripped off their headgear, revealing young and pale-looking faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was enraged as he saw their dazed looks. “If I wanted to harm you, you’d already be dead. Why haven’t you gone inside yet? If you miss this opportunity, you’ll never see your loved ones again. This is your best, and only, opportunity to leave this evil organization and free yourselves from their restraints.” He added some spiritual power into his shouting, which jolted these Holy Servants to their senses.
