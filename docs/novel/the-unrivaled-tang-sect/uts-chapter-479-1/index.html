<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the Delicate Silk Immortal had said, if some more time were to pass, and Big Mao and Second Mao became sufficiently powerful, they would probably make a move on those immortal herbs. Those immortal herbs were plant-type soul beasts, and weren’t adept in battle. On the other hand, Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears were almost the most frightening soul beasts, and battle was their forte. Their ancestors in the ancient times were probably individuals that could match up to the giant dragons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at these two in exasperation, but he was feeling happy inside. Big Mao and Second Mao’s growth undoubtedly added a lot of strength to the Tang Sect once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wa, this feels so good, just so good. Grandfather, I don’t want to leave. It’s too comfortable here.” The Ice Bear King’s voice rang out from the Extreme Chill Icespring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao snapped his head around. The Ice Bear King was swimming joyously and without care within the Extreme Icechill Spring in his original form, his body was emanating icy blue light. He did seem like he was enjoying himself a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You You was rendered speechless, and the other immortal herbs descended into silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had thought Big Mao and Second Mao were large enough, but they truly paled in comparison to the one in front of them. Furthermore, the Ice Bear King, who was still swimming happily, didn’t mask his aura at all, and the frightening ice-type undulations made the Blazing Delicate Apricot, who was on the Blazing Sunspring’s side, quiver uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two little bears had already given them enough trouble. If this extra-large bear had a go, he probably wouldn’t even need a few days to devour every single plant in this place. All the plants in this place feared for their safety, and nobody dared to make a sound. They were afraid of angering Huo Yuhao or this enormous bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao cursed under his breath as he activated his spectral demiplane, and he hurled Big Mao and Second Mao with one hand each into the demiplane. He erected a border inside the plane to protect the bears from being harmed by the undead outside before he returned to the Extreme Chill Icespring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was naturally unafraid of the Extreme Chill Icespring at his current cultivation. The temperature around the Extreme Chill Icespring was similar to that around the Manifold Mysterious Ice Cavern, and was probably higher than the cavern’s inner areas. The salient feature of this place was that the mouth of the spring coexisted with the Blazing Sunspring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandfather, my injuries are healing very quickly in this place. But I’m a little hungry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single plant around the Icefire Yin Yang Well almost shriveled when they heard that he was hungry. This time, their entire bodies were trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao almost laughed out loud when he saw how they were reacting. He could clearly remember, back when he was first here, how high and mighty these plants were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll find something for you to eat when we’re out. Are you saying that the Extreme Chill Icespring helps you with your recovery?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King immediately nodded seriously and said, “This place is filled with much origin energy of heaven and earth, and it’s just so comfortable. I don’t want to leave anymore. Why don’t you let me stay here, grandfather, and you can come get me after you finish your business?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh…” Huo Yuhao hesitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” You You immediately cried out in agony. “I beg you, Huo Yuhao, take him away. I will give you whatever you want, even if what you want is more than your ancestor Tang San’s limits. You can have whatever you want. We will cooperate as long as you don’t let him hurt us. Please take him away. Otherwise, we will be doomed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was all smiles when he heard the flower’s words and said, “How ashamed I am. I have already received so much help from you guys. How can I take anything more?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Delicate Silk Immortal didn’t even hesitate. “No, this isn’t something that you want. We are giving things to you of our own will. Every single one of us will give you something. Besides the Bluesilver Emperor that we can’t do anything about, the things we can give you should be sufficient for you to accomplish a lot of things. I just hope you will leave immediately after taking those things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Delicate Silk Immortal shook its flowerhead gently as it spoke, and the Delicate Silk Immortal Pill that Huo Yuhao had seen before flew out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pinkish pill emanated an alluring fragrance as it drifted towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao caught it subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pill was lukewarm, and shone with pinkish hues in his hands. Its gentle aroma gave him an incredibly refreshing and comfortable feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">You You was a little depressed. “Is that enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I was about to take the bear away without asking anything from you guys. However, he’s injured, and I’ll stay here with him for two days before we leave.” Huo Yuhao spoke the truth. Even though the immortal herbs and plants here had been hostile to him before, he did get quite a lot of help from this place. He didn’t harbor any resentment or hatred at all towards these plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, his ancestor Tang San had left this place behind. How could he let the Ice Bear King cause any destruction here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But You You didn’t feel that way. The flower immediately thought Huo Yuhao was being sarcastic when it heard his words, and it immediately used the plant’s language to communicate with the other plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long before an entire pile of all kinds of good stuff that immortal plants produced appeared in front of Huo Yuhao. For instance, the Blazing Delicate Apricot’s Blazing Rubber was in that stack. The Blazing Delicate Apricot was evidently afraid of Huo Yuhao holding a grudge against it, and it took out almost every single bit of its blazing rubber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other plants made their own contributions, and almost everything was the best that they could produce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was completely taken aback. He didn’t expect that the destruction that Big Mao and Second Mao had wrought would lead to something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t intend to take anything from those plants, but if the plants were so generous and giving everything out of their own free will, he would do himself wrong by not accepting their gifts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Huo Yuhao acted according to the various records inside the Poison Scripture that Tang San had left behind, and he used various methods to keep all these absolutely precious items and essences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t any burden on his conscience. After all, he hadn’t harmed the plants here. Essences were precious, but the many plants with more than a hundred thousand years of cultivation around the Icefire Yin Yang Well wouldn’t take long to recover after cultivating for a period of time. You You and the others were most afraid that Huo Yuhao would destroy everything here to get what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao understood that many of these plants were afraid of the Snow Empress and the Ice Bear King, who was happily swimming in the water. His own individual strength wasn’t enough to threaten these plants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sincerely expressed his gratitude to the immortal herbs’ generous gifts, and the plants looked on eagerly as he pulled the Ice Bear King away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King did recover a lot more quickly in this place, but the plants weren’t assured at all! Huo Yuhao had taken gifts from them, and he would be ashamed if he dallied any longer. The Ice Bear King wouldn’t need too long to recover outside, anyway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao still wanted to laugh out loud as he left the Setting Sun Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortune has shone upon me... and I couldn’t even stop it from happening! Oh, my ancestor, I didn’t ask them for anything! They wanted to give everything to me of their own will...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao touched his face and thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Am I being a little shameless? However, those precious essences and treasures are useless if they remain in that place. In my hands, at least I can save and help people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was confident that with the Delicate Silk Immortal Pill, even if he couldn’t completely heal Tang Ya, he could still suppress the evil soul power within her body to a certain extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s time to visit Heaven Dou City to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dash of cold light flickered beneath Huo Yuhao’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire, and the Holy Ghost Church… no matter what, I will not let your plans succeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The journey from the Setting Sun Forest to Heaven Dou City wasn’t far, but he was extra careful. He landed fifty kilometers from Heaven Dou City, and changed into regular clothes that normal citizens wore. He also used Imitation to readjust his appearance and facial features before he travelled towards Heaven Dou City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Ice Bear King, his appearance was unfamiliar in the first place. Even though he was a little fatter than he should be, he was just some fatty if he deliberately concealed his aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They arrived outside Heaven Dou City’s city wall in the evening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dusk was falling over the city as the sunset glow crept over the horizon. Blazing red clouds viewed from outside the city seemed to blanket the entire city in a layer of reddish-golden hues, and everything was dazzling and gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and the Ice Bear King lined up at the gate, and went through inspection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where are you from, and what is your business in Heaven Dou City?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a team of fifty soldiers at the gate. Twenty were responsible for guarding the gate, while thirty others were responsible for interrogations and inspections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had a wide arsenal of reasons and whatnot, and invented a name for himself and the Ice Bear King as they snuck through the gates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s soldiers didn’t deliberately cause any trouble for them. They were holding soul power detectors in their hands, and they could tell whether someone was a soul master by sweeping over that individual. If someone wasn’t a soul master, just asking a few questions was sufficient before the soldiers would let that person through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul power detectors were useful against typical soul masters, but they were completely useless against someone like Huo Yuhao, who was adept at concealing himself. As for the Ice Bear King, his ability to conceal himself was possibly even stronger than Huo Yuhao’s, and he was more direct. The Ice Bear King withdrew his soul power into his soul core, and the thick layer of fat on his body severed any kind of undulations readable by the soul power detectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Dou City was still bustling and flourishing. Huo Yuhao used his spiritual power to sweep around after entering the city, and could still discover the marks of battle. That was especially true around the city wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, both parties had undergone an epic battle when the Sun Moon Empire invaded Heaven Dou City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Dou City is where the Tang Sect originated from!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but clench his fists tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t you worry, Teacher Xiao Ya. I’ll help you take back our place of origin in the future, no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei and Tang Ya were considered family. Huo Yuhao wouldn’t have been able to enter Shrek Academy if not for them, and even if he fused with the Skydream Iceworm, he couldn’t possibly have accomplished what he had today. Therefore, the gratitude he bore to the two of them came from deep within his heart. The Holy Ghost Church had captured Tang Ya, and she had become the evil sect’s Sacred Lady. Besides Bei Bei, he was the one that felt the most pain. Furthermore, there was still Ma Xiaotao, who he saw as an elder sister!</span></p>
