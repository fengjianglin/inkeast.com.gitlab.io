 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look, Xiao Ya, the Tang Sect is right in front of us.” Everyone from the Tang Sect was escorting Bei Bei and Tang Ya, and they were finally back at the Tang Sect. The Tang Sect’s main gate was within sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya still seemed very dazed, and she could barely walk forward as Bei Bei supported her. Her entire being seemed like a walking undead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you still remember, Xiao Ya? You told me back then that your greatest wish was for the Tang Sect to recover, and regain their former glory. That was also your late parents’ wish. The truth is, I have been working hard ever since to find a way to rebuild the Tang Sect. I wanted to give you a pleasant surprise, but it’s my fault that you decided to leave because I didn’t try harder to understand your thoughts. That’s the reason why so many things happened afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Look, I have rebuilt the Tang Sect for you, and it grows stronger by the day. You have to recover as quickly as possible! Nannan is right, you are the rightful leader of the Tang Sect. The Tang Sect needs you to support it. How can you do that by being like this?” Bei Bei whispered into Tang Ya’s ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone walked towards the Tang Sect as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s eyes were still dazed, but when she saw the Tang Sect’s name on the plaque that hung over its main gate, her eyes trembled faintly as her lips quivered. “The Tang Sect…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though her voice was very, very soft, everyone from the Tang Sect were at least Soul Emperors. Everyone could hear her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s body shook as he stared at Tang Ya with a look of pleasant surprise on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya was still looking at the large words on the plaque. There seemed to be something more in her eyes, and her lips were still quivering. But she couldn’t say another word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone naturally stopped. They paused, and nobody disturbed her as they just let her stare at those words. There was finally something that could affect her memory, which was just fantastic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s eyes seemed to recover their confusion after a few moments. She leaned into Bei Bei’s embrace, and the color in her eyes disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said softly, “Yes, this is the Tang Sect, and it’s our home. You will stay here from today onwards, and I will accompany you always. Is that okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Tang Ya wouldn’t respond, but only then did everyone start escorting them once more, and walk into the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-----------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone started getting back to work once they came back. They hadn’t left for a long time, and they came back much earlier than the month they had predicted. However, there was still quite a bit of work piled up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, Xiao Xiao and the others went to handle those affairs, while Huo Yuhao accompanied Bei Bei to settle Tang Ya in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei stared at Xiao Ya, who was lying down on the bed, as he whispered to Huo Yuhao, “Did you hear that, Yuhao? Xiao Ya said, ‘the Tang Sect’!” Bei Bei’s eyes grew excited as he spoke, like a little child at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly nodded and said, “I did, of course I heard her. This is probably Teacher Xiao Ya’s deepest memory. Don’t worry, eldest senior brother; her memory will definitely recover as long as we continuously dispel those evil poisons. You have to continue speaking to her, as that will help catalyze her recovery. I will delegate some tasks right away, and once that is done, there are some other plans that I want to speak to you about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? What plans? If it isn’t complicated, then just tell me now. I’ve spoken to Sanshi, and he’ll help me with some of my work for some time to come. I will spend more time accompanying Xiao Ya.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “It’s not complicated. I brought back some natural treasures when I brought Big Mao and Second Mao back.” With that, he recounted how Big Mao and Second Mao ate all those herbs and medicines inside the Icefire Yin Yang Well back in the Setting Sun Forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry after listening to his story. “Those two fellows! But it seems like a bad thing has changed into a good one. I didn’t pay much attention when you told me last time. Seems like you’ve brought back quite a harvest?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “It is quite copious. I have taken away almost all the fruits and whatnot which they gestated that can be considered immortal herbs. Even if they’re considered hundred-thousand-year soul beasts, they need thousands of years to gestate good stuff like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei asked, “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lowered his voice and said, “You know, eldest senior brother, that the situation in the continent is very unclear. Even though the Sun Moon Empire has temporarily halted their invasion, war can break out again at any time, judging by the way they do things. Once the Heavenly Soul Empire can’t stop the Sun Moon Empire’s great army, the Academy will quickly receive the brunt of their attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, both the Sun Moon Empire and the Holy Ghost Church have perceived our Academy as a thorn in their side, and they would be more than happy to see us gone. Therefore, we have to make our preparations early if we want to be sufficiently effective in this war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When we were resting in my spectral demiplane several days ago, I closely studied the poison and medicine manual that Tang San, our ancestor, left behind. Tang San has detailed comprehensively what those natural treasures do, and how some herbs complement each other, and how some herbs reject each other. I am certain that everyone’s cultivation will increase exponentially after consuming these herbs. The Tang Sect’s overall strength will be greatly boosted afterwards!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think I should process these herbs soon. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei answered without hesitation, “That’s fantastic! Of course you may! What do you require the Tang Sect to help you with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that. Eldest senior brother, I just need you to convince Teacher Xuan to give me some time. I will learn about forging soul tools from him once I finish processing the herbs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei laughed. “So you’re worried about that. Don’t worry, even though Teacher Xuan is extremely stubborn, he seems to have conceded after you crafted that Class 8 soul tool. Furthermore, he isn’t an unreasonable person; you have a suitable reason, and you’re doing this for everyone. He won’t disagree. But are you confident in being able to do all that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. “There shouldn’t be a problem. Tang San’s medicine manual points out that these natural treasures will already have very strong effects when consumed individually. But because these herbs have their own special characteristics, they will also have side effects when consumed unless they’re especially suitable for a particular martial soul or body type. Forging pills from these herbs means I will attempt to fuse their unique characteristics together, which requires great control. I should have no problem with that with my Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, the things that I have brought back are of even higher quality than the herbs that Tang San has detailed. If I can refine them correctly, they will be greatly beneficial to the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded and said, “Alright, go ahead. I fully support you on this. I’ll look for Teacher Xuan in a little bit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s great!” Huo Yuhao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei instructed him, “But don’t mention this to others, because you can’t give everyone too much hope. The more hope they have, the more disappointed they’ll be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao understood the meaning in Bei Bei’s eyes. He knew that his eldest senior brother was trying to protect him. Everything would be fine if he was successful, but if he wasn’t, Bei Bei was afraid that everyone would have differing opinions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei took care of Tang Ya, and Huo Yuhao immediately left the Tang Sect. He had to delegate some tasks before purchasing some secondary materials. Forging and processing herbs wasn’t that simple, and even though he had just told Bei Bei that he was confident, he didn’t dare to be careless or overconfident at all. These were natural treasures, and weren’t something that money could buy. He would regret it immensely if something went wrong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tasks that he had to delegate were simple, and Huo Yuhao had already discussed them with Elder Song on the way back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song oversaw all the auctions within Shrek City. She had told Huo Yuhao to look for the auctioneers, and tell them that he was to announce this task through an auction. Elder Song had already sent people to give the auctioneers a heads-up after entering the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bounty, after the Tang Sect thoroughly discussed it, was finally set at a promise from the Tang Sect for a Class 8 stationary soul cannon shell or a soul tool of the same class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a bounty sufficient to drive people crazy. Both Class 8 soul tools and a Class 8 stationary soul cannon shell were priceless treasures, and only the Sun Moon Empire had them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already thought things through. If the person who claimed the bounty chose a soul tool, then he had Hongchen’s Blessing, which Jing Hongchen had given him, and he could take that one out. As for a Class 8 stationary soul cannon shell, Xuan Ziwen was already attempting to forge one. Huo Yuhao believed that with his abilities, crafting one wouldn’t be very difficult.</span></p>
