 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong nodded and replied, “Yes!”</span></p>

The way she looked at Tang Wutong also changed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was confused as she asked, “Sister Nannan, what’s going on? Didn’t the two of you just agree that martial soul fusion isn’t very common?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan was stunned as she looked at her, as if she was about to see through her. Tang Wutong felt very uncomfortable as she was watched, and furrowed her brow. “What’s wrong with all of you? You’re all acting so weirdly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan sighed and said, “We were wrong. Maybe we were all wrong. We didn’t expect it to be like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong’s expression turned a little gloomy, “Can you be clearer with your words? Do you have to be so unclear?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan shook her head and said, “Wutong, I’m sorry for all this. I apologize to you on behalf of Yuhao. His change has nothing to do with you, nor is he angry with you. Haih…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was puzzled as she asked, “Then what’s going on? When he was eating his breakfast earlier on, he seemed to have gone mad. The look in his eyes was hollow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An unbearable look flashed across Jiang Nannan’s eyes as she answered, “Yuhao is too pitiful. Alright, let me tell you a story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When Yuhao first came to Shrek Academy, he was only an ordinary young man. He only managed to enter the academy by using the Tang Sect’s quota. If he went through an ordinary examination, he wouldn’t have been able to pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was immediately drawn to this story. Although she felt that Huo Yuhao was a lecher who had tried to hug her, she was very aware of Huo Yuhao’s abilities. He was a Soul Sage who wasn’t even twenty years old. He even had twin martial souls! If he couldn’t even make it into Shrek Academy, then Shrek Academy’s standards were simply too high!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan continued saying, “After entering the Academy, he stayed in a dorm like many of the other students. He had a roommate called Wang Dong. Very soon, they became good friends. They worked hard, learned, and cultivated together. Although Yuhao appeared to be very ordinary at the start, he put in more work than anyone else. Very soon, he showed his potential in the Academy. On the other hand, Wang Dong was innately talented. With the two of them working together, they managed to become the champions of the freshmen assessment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After this, they competed in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament. They performed brilliantly, and eventually won the tournament, contributing greatly to the Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As time passed, everyone’s abilities grew significantly. As an exchange student, Huo Yuhao went to the Sun Moon Empire to learn. His friendship with Wang Dong grew tighter and tighter. After that, they met once again during a blind date in the Academy. There, he found out that the roommate that he had stayed with for so many years was actually a lady. She wasn’t Wang Dong, but Wang Dong’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This change in her gender also caused their relationship to change. Very soon, they became a couple that everyone was envious of. However, Dong’er seemed to have some kind of congenital disease. To save her, Yuhao went to the Setting Sun Forest, a place that is extremely dangerous. He suffered critical injuries, but brought back a valuable treasure. When he returned to the academy, he was on the verge of death. The Academy did its best to save him, and managed to preserve his life. However, he was paralyzed, and couldn’t walk anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After that, we participated in the same tournament for the second time. As the Sun Moon Empire targeted all the competitors of the tournament, we were forced to escape to a place called the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley. Dong’er was hurt there, and went into a coma…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan related the story of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er to Tang Wutong. Tang Wutong was slightly lost at the start, but she couldn’t help but be moved when she heard the story.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“…Yuhao couldn’t find Dong’er just like that. He didn’t know where she went until he met you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan took a deep look at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong furrowed her brow. “You mean that Wang Dong’er and I look similar?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan silently nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong snorted and said, “There are thousands of people in the Douluo Continent. What’s so strange even if we look alike? All of you recognized the wrong person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan sighed and said, “We initially thought that you were Dong’er, just that you’d lost your memory. Now it seems like we got the wrong person. Yuhao acted the way he did earlier because he confirmed this point.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? How did he do so? Just because his martial soul can’t fuse with me? It’s a joke.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan said, “A person’s martial soul can change. However, it’s very difficult to change the type of one’s soul power. Yuhao and Dong’er’s martial souls were completely compatible with each other. They both possessed twin martial souls. With the fusion of their twin martial souls, they managed to unleash an unprecedented four fusion skills. Before they managed to grow strong, they were able to beat stronger opponents with their fusion skills. They even called the fusion of their soul powers Haodong Power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When Huo Yuhao asked you to fuse your martial soul with him yesterday, his main intention should have been to confirm whether or not you were Dong’er. If your soul power could fuse, then it would have been almost certain that you were Dong’er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But now, it seems like… we were all wrong. To Yuhao, he’s lost hope. It’s understandable how tormented he feels right now. I’m sorry, Wutong. We might have caused you problems. But please understand him. He’s not even nineteen yet, but he’s gone through too much. He’s carried too much pain. It hasn’t been easy for him to reach where he is today and persist all this way. Even if you aren’t Dong’er, can you treat him better? At least seeing you can help to alleviate his yearning for Dong’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was silent, but nodded gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So there’s actually so many deep layers of reasoning. You should have told me earlier. Even though I’m not that Wang Dong’er, it seems like he isn’t a bad guy. Sister Nannan, thanks for telling me all this. You can go and eat now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Jiang Nannan acknowledged her words. There was a lost look in her eyes. She stood up, and went to get her own breakfast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong also stood up after sitting down for a while. She waved at Jiang Nannan before returning to her own tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong’er.” Tang Wutong was a little dazed as she stood in her tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wang Dong’er also has twin martial souls?” She lifted her left hand as she lowered her head. Streaks of dark gold light surged, and a strong aura was slowly released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third senior, I’m really fine. Don’t worry.” Huo Yuhao smiled as he spoke to Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi had rushed over and comforted him. The more Huo Yuhao claimed that he was fine, the more worried Xu Sanshi was. After knowing him for so many years, he understood Huo Yuhao very well. How could he possibly be fine? After finding out that Tang Wutong wasn’t Wang Dong’er, Huo Yuhao must be devastated.</span></p>

If you aren’t fine, we can go. We can follow you to find Dong’er. We’ll be able to find her.”</span></p>

The continent is so expansive, we won’t achieve anything if we search aimlessly. Third senior, go and have your breakfast. After everyone finishes eating, we’ll discuss tonight’s plan. We’ll still need to coordinate with the military so that they’ll be able to reinforce us.”</span></p>

He patted Yuhao’s shoulder before walking out of his tent.</span></p>

I’m in such great pain, but I’m able to tolerate it. If this were the past, I’d probably collapse.” After he finished mocking himself, he sat down cross-legged and starting to meditate.</span></p>

Although Tang Wutong wasn’t Wang Dong’er, at least he knew that Wang Dong’er was fine. After the war was over, he would put everything down and look for traces of her across the continent.</span></p>

The White Tiger Duke and Princess Jiuju stood around the table. Apart from the two of them, there were only Huo Yuhao and the rest from Shrek Academy. There wasn’t even a guard in the huge tent.</span></p>

The reconnaissance mission that Huo Yuhao was about to embark on was too important to the Star Luo Empire, and they had to keep it as confidential as possible, preventing any information from being leaked. Thus, only the ten of them were there.</span></p>
