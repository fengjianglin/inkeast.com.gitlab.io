<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aerial surveillance soul tools were very scattered. Undoubtedly, they had learned a lesson when Huo Yuhao had destroyed many of them at once. There were more of them now, and they were all dispersed. Furthermore, they were carrying out more in-depth surveillance to achieve greater results. Of course, this required more efforts to be invested. On that point, Ju Zi naturally didn’t skimp at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his period of observation, Huo Yuhao discovered that the aerial surveillance soul tools didn’t just protect the military base below. They were also directed towards the Dou Ling Empire. It wasn’t an exaggeration to claim that the Dou Ling Empire’s troops would be discovered as long as they came within thirty kilometers of the base. What would follow would likely be the attacks of the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion directed towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was still in awe right now. He was very impressed by the professional standards of the Sun Moon Empire. In just half a month, the size of the base was already ten times bigger than when he was first here. There were also more people around. He had not seen many of the large-scale soul tools. All the soul tools were in use, but the noise pollution they created wasn’t very high. He was less than three thousand meters in the sky right now, but no sound from below was audible at this altitude. Evidently, the Sun Moon Empire had done a great job at minimizing noise pollution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao wasn’t very experienced in mining rare metals, he could tell from the scale of their mining operations that the amount of reserves in the mines was definitely extraordinary. The Sun Moon Empire would not take much time to mine all the metals, given the scale of their mining operation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the sky, everything was clear. There were more than twenty mine tunnels. Chunks of ore were constantly being transported out of these openings. These could become rare metals that were worth a lot, and be used for the cores of soul tools after they were purified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was also a soul engineer. Even though he was far away, he could still recognize some of the more special rare metals. Given the amount of rare metals &nbsp;they had, it naturally meant that more and more weapons could be created by the Sun Moon Empire. Although the same thing would happen if he was the one with the rare metals, at least the Tang Sect and Shrek were producing weapons to stop the war, and resist invasions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s plan was very simple. First, he wanted to blind this Sun Moon Empire army before leading the Tai Tan Snowdevil army to attack them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tai Tan Snowdevil King was very unconvinced by this plan. In his opinion, the number of people here wasn’t enough to pose any threat to the Tai Tan Snowdevils. In a few attacks, everyone from the Sun Moon Empire would certainly be killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao warned him that there were many powerful weapons in the human world. Even if he was a soul beast, his life was still in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan Snowdevils were the most powerful species of savage beasts in the Extreme North. They possessed incredibly terrifying strength. Their bodies were their strongest weapon and ability. Their dominating strength was a nightmare for their enemies. However, their bodies were very large, which made them easy targets for soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was able to convince the Tai Tan Snowdevil King under the name of the Snow Empress. He was here to help. He didn’t want his entire species to be critically hurt because of him. If that was the case, he wouldn’t be able to account to the Snow Empress, either!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After observing for some time, Huo Yuhao carefully retreated. He was too easily spotted in the day if he took any action. The results would be better at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He silently returned to where the Tai Tan Snowdevils were stationed, and tweaked their original plan slightly. The Tai Tan Snowdevil King led his own species, as well as the Ice Bear King, to take a brief rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress didn’t permit the Ice Bear King to bring his own species with him. This was because the Ice Bear King was going to leave with them after this. If he brought his own people with him, he would be put in a difficult spot later on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What they needed now was to wait for nightfall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time slowly passed, and the sky slowly turned dark. A figure silently flew out from a snowdrift in the distance. More figures followed, and slowly scattered. They were all slowly moving forwards. They lightened their footsteps and tried not to make any sound as they moved forward, all of them advancing towards the same target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure in front of everyone else, with a height of around two meters, wasn’t Huo Yuhao. He was a burly man with an extremely muscular physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When savage beasts reached a certain level, they could transform into a human appearance, and the Tai Tan Snowdevil King was no exception. However, soul beasts weren’t willing to do so unless it was necessary. They could only unleash their greatest strength in their original state. Right now, they did this to better conceal themselves. In Huo Yuhao’s plan, the Tai Tan Snowdevil King definitely played the most important role.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What about Huo Yuhao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he wasn’t alone in flying towards the sky. There was a big fatty beside him. If one wasn’t observant enough, they would assume that it was a pig flying in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little helpless as he asked the Ice Bear King, “Little Bai, why are you in this form? Ah Tai looks more normal than you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That ‘pig’ was indeed the Ice Bear King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the Ice Bear King was just like a ball-shaped human. He flew beside Huo Yuhao with his huge belly. He could glide as much as he wanted. He wasn’t wearing anything, either. After all, he couldn’t fit into Huo Yuhao’s clothes! His flesh was all round, and even his head was ball-shaped. His look was extremely interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Bear King chuckled and said, “Grandpa, you don’t know about this. When I first transformed into a human, I specially asked Mom. She said that she likes me in my chubby state. That was why I chose this look. I look cool! Look at my fat. It doesn’t change how charming I taste.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smacked his forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can one describe taste as charming?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t say anything else. After all, he was already in this state. There was no way it could be changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the effect of Huo Yuhao’s Imitation, they slowly concealed themselves and flew into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he had surveilled the place earlier was because he needed to verify the area covered by the Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his daytime surveillance, Huo Yuhao already had a plan in mind. Since the Sun Moon Empire was mainly watching the Dou Ling Empire, they could sneak in from the other side. In this way, they could get close. Once they took action, they could also breach the Sun Moon Empire’s base faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao led Little Bai higher and higher into the sky. Little Bai was a savage beast. While he looked plump, he was actually faster than Huo Yuhao after he started flying. However, he admired Huo Yuhao more and more right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grandpa, your Spiritual Detection Sharing is really fun. I can see so far even though it’s so dark. Haha, take a look! Ah Tai is still foolishly running. Look at him, he’s so small. It’s so fun!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quiet. Otherwise, I’ll ask your mom to whack you.” Huo Yuhao could only turn fierce against the babbling Little Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai immediately quieted down. After turning into a human, his eyes became a little shifty. He pleaded, “Grandpa, don’t do that. I’ll keep quiet!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little amused, and stopped entertaining him. His Spiritual Detection wasn’t just linked with Little Bai. It was also linked with the Tai Tan Snowdevil King below. This aided his commanding through his surveillance and detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was a thousand meters from the ground. This was a huge burden on his spiritual power, given how far he had to unleash his Spiritual Detection Sharing. Without his soul core, he would have been unable to do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, the Tai Tan Snowdevils stopped at his command. They hid behind a mountain covered in snow. This mountain was a bit more than twenty kilometers from the Sun Moon Empire’s base. It was also the limit of the aerial surveillance soul tools. As the other Tai Tan Snowdevils were unable to become humans, they were being deployed further away, near the twenty-five kilometer mark. They crouched down and silently waited for instructions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These Tai Tan Snowdevils were easily commanded, carrying out Tai Tan Snowdevil King’s instructions without any questions asked. This made Huo Yuhao’s job much easier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao and Little Bai were already close to the boundary of the aerial surveillance soul tools. Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “It’ll depend on us next. Come, let’s go.” As he spoke, his figure flashed, and he sat on Little Bai’s shoulders. In terms of cultivation, they were a far way off from one another. The tough job of rising into the sky was naturally easier for Little Bai.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Bai kicked his legs in the sky. His actions seemed very clumsy, but his body shot up like a huge cannon shell. He was even faster than the White Tiger Duke had been!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was seated very stably on his shoulders, like a spike that had been nailed to the Ice Bear King’s shoulders. The wind around him quickly flashed past, and the temperature dropped continuously. Their surroundings also became increasingly quiet.</span></p>
