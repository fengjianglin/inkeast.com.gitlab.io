 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe instantly opened his eyes wide. “This is actually the Heavenly Centipede Douluo, Nangong Wan? No wonder he seemed so familiar. When I was out exploring after I graduated from the Academy, I once interacted with him. His martial soul was very difficult to deal with, especially with the poison in it. I wanted to kill him then, but his poison was too strong. Eventually, he escaped. I didn’t expect him to land in your hands today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song shook her head and said, “He didn’t exactly land in my hands. Yuhao and I teamed up to capture him. To be honest, I’m starting to like the idea of fighting alongside Yuhao. With him around, I feel that my powers have increased.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe didn’t expect Elder Song to think so highly of Huo Yuhao and laughed, “Elder Song, don’t spoil my little junior like that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song chortled and said, “I mean what I say. Yuhao’s spiritual power is not inferior to any spiritual-type Titled Douluo. Apart from his cultivation being slightly weaker, his control and auxiliary abilities are definitely not inferior to a Titled Douluo. For fights at our tier, it would be of great help if he were around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little embarrassed as he said, “Elder Song, you praise me too much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song smiled without saying anything. Yan Shaozhe laughed, “Little junior, don’t be so humble. Come, tell us how you faced the Heavenly Centipede Douluo, and describe the entire fighting process.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at Elder Song. After Elder Song gave him permission, he described how he had met and fought the two evil soul masters in detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After learning that he had killed another evil Titled Douluo, Yan Shaozhe couldn’t laugh anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they were not that strong yet, those from the Tang Sect didn’t participate in fights against Titled Douluo. However, Yan Shaozhe was clearly aware of the abilities of evil Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew how frustrating they were to deal with. He questioned whether he could deal with two evil soul masters in such a short time even if he teamed up with Elder Song. From Huo Yuhao’s description, it seemed like the two evil soul masters were killed even before they managed to unleash their full strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes are very mysterious. No wonder Elder Song is so in awe of him. No wonder he’s a leading figure of the new generation! No wonder teacher mentioned that the Academy would have a pillar once Yuhao grows up. The Academy’s reputation as the top academy on the continent is destined to continue on!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao.” Yan Shaozhe suddenly turned serious and looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes? Dean Yan.” Huo Yuhao didn’t understand why Yan Shaozhe had suddenly become so serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe said, “After this operation ends, don’t go out so often anymore. Remain in the Tang Sect or on Sea God’s Island to cultivate. It’s best if you wait until your cultivation reaches that of a Titled Douluo before you leave again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t expect Yan Shaozhe to say this. He revealed a bitter smile on his face. The Tang Sect already had a Teacher Xuan who wouldn’t let him leave the sect. Now there was Dean Yan as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded in agreement and said, “Shaozhe is right. After we return this time, I’ll talk to Elder Xuan. Don’t leave Shrek City so easily in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Song, Dean Yan, why is that?” Xiao Xiao asked, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe smiled and answered, “The Academy can’t afford to lose him. Yuhao is too important to the Academy’s future. Even though soul tools have become the trend of late, individual abilities are still of critical importance at the highest level. In the future, the Academy will need someone who is very strong. Yuhao is shaping up to be this person. He was like teacher back then. He’s even surpassed him. We can’t let him take any risks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded. She completely agreed with Yan Shaozhe’s point of view.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and said, “Titled Douluo… that’ll take some time. But…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are no buts,” Elder Song said. “No matter what happens, nothing is more important than your successful development. Whatever you want to achieve outside, the Academy can help you. However, you must remain within Shrek City. Bei Bei, you are responsible for watching him after we return. If he sneaks off, I’ll question you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Bei Bei revealed a smile on his face. He secretly thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like I don’t have to worry about little junior’s safety for some time now...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao coughed and said, “Elder Song, Dean Yan, we should interrogate Nangong Wan first. Let’s see if we can find out where Teacher Xiao Ya is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded and said, “I’m afraid it’ll be difficult. Evil soul masters are very twisted. They aren’t afraid of dying. Furthermore, we can’t force them to say anything. What ideas do you have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I can use my spiritual power to interfere with his thoughts and question him from there on, forcing him to tell the truth. However, my spiritual power must be far beyond his before I can do that, and he’s a Titled Douluo. Even if his soul power is sealed, his spiritual power is still very strong. I’m afraid it’ll be difficult.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s eyes shone with a cold light. “That’s simple. I’ll just make him sufficiently weak. A person’s mind is greatly connected to his body. When someone is weakened beyond a certain degree, his mind will also become weak and vulnerable. You can exploit that opportunity to question him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “If that’s the case, I’ll give it a go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone else can go back and rest. Shaozhe, Yuhao, follow me.” Elder Song grabbed Nangong Wan with one hand and walked toward a room where no one was staying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Elder Song, let me tag along.” He was really anxious about Tang Ya’s whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded and said, “Alright, you can come along.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four of them led Nangong Wan into the room. Elder Song passed Nangong Wan over to Yan Shaozhe and said, “Shaozhe, you can take over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe nodded and said, “Let me take a look at his condition first, to see if he has any restrictions placed on him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentle white light shone from Yan Shaozhe’s hand. He used his palms to quickly slap Nangong Wan all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he started slapping, Nangong Wan started shaking. At the beginning, the shaking was very gentle. However, as Yan Shaozhe slapped him even harder, Nangong Wan’s body started to shake more and more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To a Titled Douluo, the power of his soul core was the core of his strength. Elder Song was using her soul power to seal Nangong Wan’s soul core such that it spun at a slower speed. From there, it would be unable to provide him enough soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe only checked for fifteen minutes before he stopped. He nodded at Elder Song and said, “It should be fine. Even the Holy Ghost Church will find it difficult to put any restrictions on him, given his cultivation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded and said, “Let’s start then. What do you plan to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s eyes flashed coldly, “I’ll cripple his soul core first and allow his soul power to dissipate. In that way, he won’t harm anyone anymore. Furthermore, without his soul power to support him, his body will become very weak, even with his great spiritual power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded and said, “Alright, we’ll do that then. You can do it, I’ll protect you. Yuhao, be prepared. After we cripple his soul power, we don’t know what kind of reaction we will elicit. We need to keep him from descending into hysteria.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao walked to one side and sat cross-legged on a chair. He temporarily took a rest to restore his energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe stood in front of the bed that they had laid Nangong Wan out on. His hands formed a ring in front of his body. Gentle white soul power surged out, and gradually turned dim gold. The soul power undulations he released also started to dance like flames. The soul power slowly formed a whirlpool drifting above Nangong Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t easy trying to cripple a Titled Douluo’s soul core. It was like what had happened when Huo Yuhao performed histest. A huge explosion could occur if one’s soul core was affected. If the soul core of a Titled Douluo exploded, it could potentially be very dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a Titled Douluo died, like the Masquerade Douluo had, things would still be fine. That was because the soul core of a dead Titled Douluo would shrink and slowly vanish as he gradually lost his life energy. Even if an explosion occurred, it would happen in another dimension. It wouldn’t affect this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, crippling a soul master’s soul core before he was dead was much more troublesome. A soul master’s soul core depended on the soul master’s life energy. To cripple his soul core, the soul power in his soul core had to be guided out, and the soul core had to be destroyed just as it was at its weakest point.</span></p>

A white whirlpool subtly appeared in front of Yan Shaozhe’s belly, where his soul core was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was a Transcendent Douluo. As Elder Mu’s inheriting disciple and the dean of Shrek Academy’s Martial Soul Department, he was very strong. His Radiant Phoenix was a top-ranked martial soul, and he was a Transcendent Douluo. All these years, his soul power had been slowly improving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was now a Rank 96 Titled Douluo. Compared to Elder Song, he was only inferior by one rank. Although the difference in this one rank was very great, Yan Shaozhe might not be much weaker than Elder Song if he fought her with his full strength, considering that his martial soul was much stronger.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao, who was resting, could feel something. He didn’t need to open his eyes, and only silently sensed the soul power undulations from Yan Shaozhe’s body. He was secretly impressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe’s soul power was circulating in a whirlpool state around his soul core. However, the circulation of his soul power was much slower than Huo Yuhao’s, because his soul power was completely fluid!</span></p>
