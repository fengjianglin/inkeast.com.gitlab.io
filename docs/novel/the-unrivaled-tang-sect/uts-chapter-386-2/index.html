 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of golden light that looked like a moving dragon appeared within the area where all the soul tools were deployed. The streak of golden light was simply too quick. Wherever it passed, soul tools were instantly destroyed, and pathetic screams started to ring out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder shouted, “What are the aerial surveillance soul tools doing!? Lock onto them!” As he spoke, he shot a look at the Fourth Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had to hold the fort here and control Huo Yuhao and the other two. It was more suitable for the Fourth Elder to deal with that streak of golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Elder nodded slightly. Soul rings started to rise from beneath his feet as he lifted his right hand. There were nine soul rings: two yellow, three purple and four black. They showed off his immense Titled Douluo abilities. A thick black fog was also released from his body, engulfing him completely. No part of his body could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This black fog started to descend. As it shifted, it revealed a sharp aura, even though it looked very gentle. In a flash, it reached the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The figure that was flashing within the golden light materialized and appeared in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she appeared, she immediately caught everyone’s attention. Even the evil soul masters were drawn to her, because she was simply too beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her powdery-blue wavy hair flowed behind her head, and there was a layer of frost covering her ravishing face. An illusory golden dragon subtly appeared around her body. She was also holding a long spear with two pointed sides, pointed diagonally towards the sky. Even though she was standing in place, she seemed like the greatest creation ever. At this moment, she was looking at Huo Yuhao trapped within the Third Elder’s lightning net with her big, powdery-blue eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao appeared to be in a daze. Following this, this dazed look turned into a touched and guilty look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, this person with such ravishing looks, wavy hair, and beautiful eyes was the Golden Dragon Girl, Wang Qiu’er!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t understand why Wang Qiu’er was here at such a time. However, he had mixed feelings right now.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qiu’er, you were really silly! It’s not worth it for me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao slowly shut his eyes as he took in a deep breath and gradually retracted his Domain of Perpetual Ice. However, the layer of golden light on his body became stronger. His Eye of Destiny was completely open at this point, and there seemed to be countless streaks of golden light shining in this vertical eye. It appeared to be boundless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, a thin golden line also appeared on Wang Qiu’er’s forehead. In the next instant, it split open, revealing another golden vertical eye. It was also shining with countless streaks of golden light, and it seemed identical to Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything around them seemed to solidify when these two Eyes of Destiny opened. Time and space were completely locked at this instant. Even the Third and Fourth Elders were drawn to the golden lights from their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er lifted their heads together and faced their Eyes of Destiny towards the sky. Two beams of golden lights shot into the sky at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two beams of golden light illuminated everything, and the sky turned bright gold at this final moment before dawn arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two beams of lights intersected and instantly burst to a higher position. The pre-dawn darkness was torn apart, and a huge golden vertical eye appeared in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Streaks of golden lights scattered everywhere and engulfed everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er were the first two to be affected by these streaks of golden light. An illusory projection of a golden vertical eye appeared behind their backs, turning them slightly illusory. As for the rest, including Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu, they felt that there was something in their bodies controlling them as these streaks of golden light engulfed their bodies. An indescribable sense of crisis and suppression quickly spread in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Destiny Gaze!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the true, complete version of Destiny Gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er, a small vertical eye also appeared above everyone’s heads. However, the vertical eyes above Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu were a dim gold. The vertical eyes above the rest were icy-white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take action! Quick, kill them!” a sharp scream sounded out. The first to react weren’t the two Titled Douluo, but the eight-ringed Soul Douluo, Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had a spiritual-type martial soul, and so she was the least astonished by everything that was happening. However, she was also the most sensitive to danger. The feeling of having her destiny controlled by someone else filled her Spirit of Vengeance with fear. Along with the deep impression that the scene in Huo Yuhao’s Imitation had given her, she only had one thought in her mind right now – escape! The only way for her to escape was to kill Huo Yuhao, Wang Qiu’er, and the rest! After she killed them, everything would return to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her screams was filled with spiritual undulations. The soul engineers who were in a daze were immediately jolted awake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, countless streaks of blue light wove in the air and started to reach towards Huo Yuhao and the rest. Most of the firepower was targeted towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, something strange happened at this moment. These soul rays and cannon shells that shot towards the four of them struck nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed as if they had covered every angle, and that Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er couldn’t possibly escape, but nothing they fired hit them. The soul rays and cannon shells simply brushed past their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if some mysterious, special force was protecting them from harm. Even Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu were spared from harm, as many soul rays simply brushed past their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Idiot, who told you to attack? Seal our surroundings and don’t let them escape!” The Third Elder shouted furiously and tightened his lightning net, which helped to block off the attacks coming from the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion for Huo Yuhao and the rest. While Huo Yuhao was just a good research subject, he couldn’t let Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu come to harm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he shouted, Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er moved at the same time, as though they were telepathically linked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao sank down, and it seemed as if he was trying to collide against the lightning net below him. Wang Qiu’er twisted and charged upward towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Elder naturally wouldn’t let her go to Huo Yuhao’s aid. He snorted, and black fog spread from his body. A sinister beam of cold light instantly surfaced, and slashed towards Wang Qiu’er’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Elder’s martial soul was a Netherworld Sword. His Netherworld Sword was extremely special. It could create another alternate plane of space that was illusory, mysterious and unpredictable when it was used. Every time this alternate plane of space was created, he needed to ignite someone’s spirit as the price. As his cultivation increased and he became a Titled Douluo, he could only seal the souls of nine dead people. After using them, he had to replace them. Even with all this, he was still considered one of the evil soul masters that had committed the fewest sins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attack of his was called Netherworld Slash, the Fourth Elder’s first soul skill. It was sharp and quick. With the abilities of a Titled Douluo, even a small hill could be slashed in half with this soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder revealed a disdainful look on his face when he saw how Huo Yuhao charged downward. He mimicked a clenching action, and his lightning net shrank once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was confident in his soul tool. No protective barrier was effective against his lightning net. An Invincible Barrier could only protect one’s body, but it couldn’t help one breach his lightning net.</span></p>
