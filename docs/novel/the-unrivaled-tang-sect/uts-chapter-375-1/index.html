It was necessary to proceed with caution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on his own senses and observation of the flow of people around him, Huo Yuhao believed that he had entered a central region of Sunrise City. He stopped conserving his spiritual power as he reached this region. He activated his Spiritual Detection and focused his spiritual power to scan in a certain direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wherever his spiritual power passed, everything that he surveyed was presented in his mind as a three-dimensional construct. As there were many buildings in the city to obstruct his detection, he couldn’t detect as far as he could in an uncluttered area. However, the findings that he obtained were sufficient for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He started thinking, his spiritual sea undulating tremendously. He slowly made a full turn and quickly scanned in one direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunrise City only stretched slightly more than twenty kilometers across. With Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power and the Eye of Destiny, he could almost scan the entire city if he stood in the center of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just that he couldn’t actually do this, as it would be too dangerous. His Eye of Destiny was too attention-catching. Even as he observed his surroundings, he conserved some of his spiritual power. Although his ability was unidirectional, he restricted the distance of his detection to a radius of two kilometers. In that way, he could still capture everything that was within the core region of Sunrise City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a Titled Douluo couldn’t do something like this. There were no surveillance soul tools that could carry out such an all-around inspection, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao completed his turn, there was a surprised look in his eyes. However, he soon returned to normal, and walked in the direction of the marks left behind by his teammates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tang Sect had decided to put up at a medium-sized hotel. Before they set off, they had already put on their disguises. Of course, the hotel that they were staying in was naturally not at the address that Nan Qiuqiu had left for that small team leader.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was sitting in the main hall of the hotel, drinking cheap beer as he waited for Huo Yuhao. After seeing him enter the hotel, he immediately waved Yuhao over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao walked over to Xu Sanshi’s side and sat down. He also ordered a pint of beer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What took you so long? Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “I’m fine. Has everyone settled down?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi nodded. “Things are fine. Have they revealed anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “A few things. I haven’t found where they are keeping the hostages. However, there a few high-class soul tools installed in the center of the city. The majority of them are stationary soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had discovered many things as he observed the city. He had discovered more than thirty residential houses were equipped with advanced soul tools. They were at least Class 6 soul tools, and there were even a few that were Class 7 and Class 8. There were some that he felt were very dangerous, especially those that he had never seen before. It was even possible that they were Class 9 soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Huo Yuhao not be shocked given such a situation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunrise City was under complete surveillance right now. Undoubtedly, there were many surveillance soul tools above the city. Once something was found to be amiss, signals could be transmitted to the ground immediately. The advanced soul tools that were hidden in the city could then immediately seek out their targets. If there wasn’t any emphasis on preventing civilian casualties, those who were discovered were almost certainly doomed. In addition, there were still the two soul engineer legions outside the city!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi furrowed his brow and asked, “What about underground? What did you find out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “There’s nothing underground. My Spiritual Detection is greatly affected once I try to use it underground. It can only extend fifty meters underground. Even if I use my Eye of Destiny, it can only increase the range to a hundred meters. I need to be directly above in order to get a clearer picture.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I haven’t surveyed the entire city yet, but I think that the hostages are likely to be locked underground. As long as it’s deep enough, and the number of entrances and exits are restricted, it’ll be very difficult to breach. They’ll be much more secure than if they were above ground. Considering how the Sun Moon Empire likes to construct all types of structures underground, that is the likeliest possibility. However, they took very strict defensive measures this time. After I entered the city, I discovered that there were many pipes connected underground at the edges of the city walls. There are people watching these pipes, which are used to listen for any underground movement. As for any other measures, I haven’t discovered them yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi nodded and said, “It’s already not easy to discover all this. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, take your time. After all, we’ve just arrived. Go back and rest. We still need to continue tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Huo Yuhao followed Xu Sanshi back to their rooms. There were four guys and three ladies among the seven of them. The three ladies shared one room, while the four guys were split between two rooms. Huo Yuhao stayed with Ji Juechen, since He Caitou and Xu Sanshi were unwilling to room with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Ji.” After he entered, Huo Yuhao immediately saw Ji Juechen sitting on a bed. He sounded very annoyed at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he entered, a sharp sword intent quickly greeted him. The room was dimly lit, but two bolts of electricity immediately flashed as Ji Juechen opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his sword intent was like ice in the face of boiling water, it was immediately dispelled. Furthermore, it didn’t even cause Huo Yuhao any problems.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen was stunned. “I didn’t realize you were already so strong. What’s your cultivation like now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled slightly and replied, “You seem to only say those words when you are concerned about your opponents’ abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When can we start fighting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao twisted his lips and said, “It won’t be soon. The enemies we are facing are unprecedentedly strong. We were sent over this time because the strong soul masters from the Academy are certainly being watched. The Tang Sect is less of a target. In addition, the Sun Moon Empire won’t expect people of our cultivations to save the hostages. We’ll likely only make our move after I find out what the situation in Sunrise City is like. However, it’s more important to outsmart our enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Ji Juechen acknowledged his words before shutting his eyes and meditating again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little annoyed as he shook his head. He felt that his words were falling on deaf ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t eat in the hotel, either. After eating some dry rations, he sat cross-legged on a bed opposite Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t enter a deep meditative state. Right now, he was wracking his brain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After his observation today, it seemed his hypothesis about the arrangement of soul tools and soul engineer legions was pretty accurate. The city was covered both inside and outside, and there were both ground-based and aerial soul tools. The entire city was covered. However, Huo Yuhao still felt that this wasn’t the full strength in Sunrise City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The city seemed to be very strong, and they even had Class 9 soul tools to hold the fort. However, could they really hold off the other three empires on the continent with two soul engineer legions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the three empires risked everything, they could mobilize more than fifty Titled Douluo. With such strength, it was unlikely that the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions could resist them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one from the Holy Ghost Church is here? Impossible, they must be involved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao understood evil soul masters by now. The cultivation methods of evil soul masters were different. Usually, they involved the sacrifice of living spirits, which was also the reason why they were known as evil soul masters. As for these hostages who were held captive, they were undoubtedly very suited for cultivation. Their bodies and spirits were no doubt very valuable to evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, the Holy Ghost Church regarded them highly. Once the war escalated into a full-scale one, these hostages would lose their significance, and the Sun Moon Empire wouldn’t keep them alive anymore. They would try to make them submit, and if they refused, they would be killed.</span></p>
