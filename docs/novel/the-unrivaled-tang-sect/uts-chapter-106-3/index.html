 <p><strong>Book 13: Life Gold</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 106.3: The Eye of Life</strong></p>
 <p>Both the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Empress remained at the lake, as if they had felt the probing from Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power. They turned their gazes into the sky, and Huo Yuhao immediately sensed that they were watching him.</p>
 <p>At this moment, these two powerful soul beasts started to radiate with pale brilliance. Especially the Skyream Iceworm, who was a emanating tender golden light that flooded his spiritual sea. It looked like he was fusing his vast pools of soul power with himself to boost his expanded spiritual sea.</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress was emitting layers of light that were a mix of icy-white and green. These layers of light were first infused into the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton before they were spread all around Huo Yuhao’s body.</p>
 <p>Neither the Skydream Iceworm’s nor the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s power could increase Huo Yuhao’s soul power, as they had already become Huo Yuhao’s martial souls, but the Mysterious Heaven Technique’s soul power had also taken two different forms of existence. There was no question that the changes they were currently undergoing were meant to boost Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea, his physical strength and the power of every one of his soul rings.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao could still use his spiritual detection to perceive his surroundings before his absorption of the Life Gold. However, there was no way he could be clairvoyant, and his personal senses were only slightly superior to those of normal people. The Life Gold had triggered an almost sublime transformation in his body, but his powers didn’t appear vastly improved, as the effects worked to develop his potential while giving him a boost to his senses.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao rushed into the bathroom to cleanse his body and changed into a set of clean clothes the moment he witnessed the changes that were happening to the Skydream Iceworm and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. He checked himself in the mirror and made sure that there wasn’t a third eye on his forehead, as if that eye had only existed in his sensations – but the feeling of its existence was just too real.</p>
 <p>He refused to mull over it too much, and returned to his bed. He started to channel the Mysterious Heaven Technique and activated his soul power to begin his cultivation, as he had a faint feeling that cultivating at this time would be most beneficial to himself.</p>
 <p>All Wang Dong saw when he slunk back into the room was Huo Yuhao, who was deep in meditation.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was a little surprised as he watched him. Even though Huo Yuhao didn’t seem any different on the surface, Wang Dong had a feeling that there was something different about his friend, and it felt like his temperament was different. Huo Yuhao’s physical appearance was originally slightly above average, but he suddenly seemed to have a new and unique kind of charm.</p>
 <p>Self-confidence, steadiness and a few measures of depth – yet, he was still filled with liveliness and brimmed with vitality.</p>
 <p>“This guy is just too hardworking. He can still be so involved even when he’s cultivating alone – he can even enter deep meditation.”</p>
 <p>Soul masters generally experienced two different states during their cultivation – meditation and deep meditation. Standard meditation could typically be interrupted, and the soul master would wake up naturally when there was external stimulus, or if the soul master detected any change in his physical surroundings, so any adverse effects would be highly limited. Therefore, this form of meditation was also referred to as light cultivation.</p>
 <p>This was the state that they would typically enter when Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao teamed up to concentrate the Haodong power. After all, they had to pass the Haodong power around, and thus they couldn’t let their soul power course around freely.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, deep meditation was a serendipitous occurrence that only came about when one had an epiphany in the process of normal meditation. The meditator’s consciousness would sink deep into his or her cultivation, and their entire being would be fixated – one would no longer be able to experience any changes in the outside world and, would only wake when it was time.</p>
 <p>The soul master’s soul power would be circulating automatically during deep meditation, and at a speed that was much faster than during normal meditation. At the same time, the soul master would experience a higher level of absorption and perception during deep meditation. Many things that were typically perplexing or difficult to fathom would become a lot more transparent and understandable during deep meditation.</p>
 <p>Any soul master would wish that he or she could enter deep meditation during cultivation, especially when they were breaking through a bottleneck. If the soul master was lucky enough to encounter deep meditation, he or she would experience a success rate of higher than eighty percent.</p>
 <p>Because of the very reason that deep meditation encompassed a profound level of comprehension and cultivation, soul masters in deep meditation were most afraid of being interrupted. They ran the risk of going insane if they were interrupted, and it could even be reflected in real and severe bodily harm.</p>
 <p>It was easy to differentiate between normal and deep meditation. There was no change in physical state or appearance during normal cultivation, as soul power was only circulating inside the soul master’s body. There would only be a slight external aura or release when there was a special or esoteric technique in play, or if the soul master was breaking through a bottleneck – for instance, when Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were cultivating with Haodong power, Huo Yuhao’s body would radiating with golden light under the effects of the Golden Light Left Arm Bone.</p>
 <p>Due to the need for personal protection, the soul master’s soul power would be automatically released to protect himself or herself during deep cultivation, and mask his or her aura at the same time.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was currently in this exact state. There were layers of white light shimmering outside his body, as if his entire body were a jewel that sparkled with plain rays of light.</p>
 <p>It was natural for other people to develop some sense of envy or jealousy when they witnessed others in deep meditation. However, Wang Dong was different, and he only felt glad for Huo Yuhao. He made a few mischievous expressions before he took a chair, discreetly departed the room and took his place outside to protect his friend and prevent Huo Yuhao from being affected by anybody from Shrek who came around looking for him.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao felt a wave of warmth course through his body the moment he woke up from his deep meditation. The green colors in his body had vanished completely, and his soul power was vastly improved. He had just reached Rank 28, but he was now clear of a third of his journey into Rank 29. Besides cultivating with Haodong power in his daily activities, this episode of deep meditation proved to be of great help.</p>
 <p>His speed of cultivation during deep cultivation was higher than when he channeled Haodong power with Wang Dong. However, this was only a state that came around solely by chance.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao leapt down from the bed, and he felt light as a feather. There was an inexplicable feeling of comfort, as if his entire body was a lot lighter than before – this was a feeling that couldn’t even be fully described with the word “beautiful”.</p>
 <p>Everything seemed to be different, and his self-confidence returned – was he finally getting closer to greatness?</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao clenched his fists tightly together as he glanced outward. It looked like it was still midday, but he felt as he if he had been renewed, and the flames relit inside him.</p>
 <p>“Why hasn’t Wang Dong returned? He’s taking too long to bathe,” Huo Yuhao didn’t feel that he had taken a long time to cultivate, and distinctly remembered that they had been cultivating together in the morning before he took back the Soul-Devouring Carving Knife. Afterwards, Wang Dong went ahead to take a shower while he continued to cultivate – he should be back by now!</p>
 <p>He walked out as these thoughts turned in his head. The moment he pulled the door toward him, he felt a pushing force coming from the other side.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was caught off-guard, and subconsciously reacted as he leapt backwards and quickly released his martial soul – but what came next left his mouth agape.</p>
 <p>“Bam-”</p>
 <p>“Ouch.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong fell backwards along with his chair, and Huo Yuhao immediately hurried forward to help him up. “What are you doing? Why are you waiting outside? Why didn’t you come in?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong had been sitting outside this whole time, and his body had been leaning against the door. He was already starting to doze off, and when the door opened, Wang Dong fell backwards onto the ground with his chair.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was furious. “You’re terribly ungrateful! I was protecting you, and all you do when you wake up is let me fall back onto the ground. Are you going to take care of me if I cripple myself because of this?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “Have I not been taking care of you in the dorm? When have you cleaned up the dorm? Or swept the floor? Or mopped the floor? When have you even done anything at all? Even your wardrobe is cleaned by me. You’re like a big boss figure every day.”</p>
 <p>“I…” Wang Dong wanted to retort, but he couldn’t find a suitable argument to make. He scowled and said, “Stop with your loud rhetoric and your fallacious arguments. I’ll let you off the hook this time. You seemed to be having a good time with all that deep meditation, while my ass was about to break into several pieces.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao reached out and pressed against Wang Dong’s butt cheeks. “It’s all good. Let me massage you.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was still young, but his little butt cheeks were firm and springy. Huo Yuhao squeezed a few times, and immediately realized that the feeling in his hands was pretty good.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was quick. Before he even finished his sentence, his hands were already in action, and Wang Dong’s entire body froze. He even felt a little immobilized.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao squeezed a few more times, but faintly realized that something was amiss. He glanced at Wang Dong out of the corners of his eyes – Wang Dong was glaring at him, and his face was black while his eyes were spitting flames.</p>
 <p>“Does it feel good?” A chilly voice floated out from between the gaps in his teeth.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s not so bad.” Huo Yuhao’s answer was almost subconscious.</p>
 <p>“Go to hell.” Wang Dong tossed his head and raised his left leg for a high kick that was aimed straight at Huo Yuhao’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao tilted his head backwards hurriedly and dodged his kick. However, Wang Dong’s body was extremely nimble, and his right foot, which was supporting his body, rotated like a fulcrum, and his left foot returned once again – and swept across Huo Yuhao’s body at once.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t even need to see with his eyes as he swung his body backwards and avoided Wang Dong’s kick once more while his entire body became like a plank.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s sweeping left leg paused in the air and slammed downwards at Huo Yuhao’s abdomen. Huo Yuhao spun around in midair as he dragged his right leg upwards and pressed his kneecap against the calf of Wang Dong’s left leg to stop its movement. At the same time, his right leg sprung up and back down again and wrapped around Wang Dong’s right leg like a whip. He pushed against the ground with both hands and pulled backwards – instantly, both of them fell down together with their legs still intertwined.</p>
 <p>It was clear that Wang Dong had never expected Huo Yuhao to be so adaptable. He watched Huo Yuhao with an astonished look and said, “When did you become so agile and flexible?”</p>
 <p>“I’ve always been flexible,” Huo Yuhao answered proudly, “and a gentleman uses his mouth, not his fists.”</p>
