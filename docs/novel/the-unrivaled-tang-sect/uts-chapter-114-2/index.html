 <p><strong>Book 13: Life Gold</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 114.2: The Body Sect</strong></p>
 <p>Yes, it was a natural and smooth feeling. From the very start, Ma Rulong took the initiative. Following that, he relentlessly chained his attacks while reacting accurately to Jiang Peng’s changes, using the most suitable soul tool to respond.</p>
 <p>He seemed to have achieved victory very leisurely. However, the truth was that he would have had to face the continuous attacks of his opponent if he messed up even a single chain attack. Jiang Peng’s Darkdemon Heavenquake allowed one to see how frightening a Soul Emperor’s explosiveness was.</p>
 <p>The entire place was struck with awe as Jiang Peng was defeated. Over on the Imperial Profound Academy’s side, the faces of Jiang Peng’s team members were filled with dismay. If even Jiang Peng couldn’t defeat Ma Rulong, who else could?</p>
 <p>What was even more frightening was Ma Rulong’s composure. His chest started to shine with a white halo immediately after he struck Jiang Peng. Without a doubt, it must have been the effect of some soul tool that was similar to the Milk Bottle. It was replenishing Ma Rulong’s depleted soul power.</p>
 <p>The Imperial Profound Academy was stunned for a while before hesitantly sending a new team member up to the competition stage. However, what chance did they have left?</p>
 <p>Ma Rulong didn’t display his strength any further. He only used the few soul tools that he had used before. Even so, no one could resist him with his precise control.</p>
 <p>According to Huo Yuhao’s observations, the only soul tool that could possibly be a Class 7 soul tool was the golden cannon. The cannon shot out rays that were of extremely high temperature. These rays were so hot that even Ma Xiaotao’s phoenix flames would be penetrated if they met. The referees even had to intervene in the following rounds of the competition to save the Imperial Profound Academy’s team members.</p>
 <p>Ma Rulong eventually ended the remaining matches with his soul tools, and the Imperial Profound Academy dropped out of the tournament. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy reached the finals without a hitch.</p>
 <p>A lot had happened in this year’s Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, but it eventually was still the pair of old rivals that would meet in the finals – Shrek Academy and the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao watched the entire competition carefully. On the way back to the Grand Imperial Star Hotel, he constantly pondered over something. Wang Yan was also doing the same.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was greatly moved by Ma Rulong’s strategy and the entire competition process. Firstly, Huo Yuhao learned that a soul tool created by oneself was the most appropriate soul tool to use. Ma Rulong had also showed Huo Yuhao the strategy of a soul engineer. The key to Ma Rulong’s successive victories lay in his control of the battle.</p>
 <p>They were stopped by 2 people when they were about to go up to their rooms after reaching the lobby of the Grand Imperial Star Hotel.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Wang Yan was walking in front, but he was blocked. He was stunned, and lifted his head to look at the two people blocking his way.</p>
 <p>They were two men who looked very ordinary in terms of appearance, but their figures were very peculiar. One of them had an abnormally large right arm, whereas the other one was very thin, but his head was huge, as if he were a big-headed doll.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan felt a chill in his heart and said in a deep voice, “Excuse me.”</p>
 <p>The guy with the huge right arm said, “All of you can go, but this little fellow must stay. We need to talk to him.” This guy was growling. Although he was trying to restrain himself, he still released a terrifying, authoritative aura. He was pointing towards Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was also stunned. “I don’t know either of you.”</p>
 <p>The big-headed guy looked at Huo Yuhao and smiled slightly. He said, “Don’t you know us now?” The look in his eyes was very strange. It was weirdly gentle. When Wang Yan and Xu Sanshi peered into his eyes, they went into a trance. Huo Yuhao suddenly tensed up and golden light shone from his Spirit Eyes. Wang Dong was in a momentary daze, and a streak of odd radiance flashed in the depth of his eyes. He also wasn’t confused by the big-headed guy’s gaze.</p>
 <p>“We don’t mean any harm. We just want to talk to you. If you don’t want those around you to be hurt, follow us.” The big-headed guy saw the shocked look in Huo Yuhao’s eyes and led the other guy to the resting area at one corner of the hall. There were a few sofas there for guests to rest.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan and Xu Sanshi woke up from their trance too. The two of them were astounded that the big-headed guy could force them into that trance. His cultivation must be above theirs! Wang Yan’s abilities were nothing spectacular in Shrek Academy, but he was still a soul king. To be suppressed by someone else so easily, the gap in their abilities shouldn’t be small.</p>
 <p>However, Wang Yan calmed himself down after a period of momentary shock. He nodded at Huo Yuhao and said, “Go and hear what they have to say. I will follow you. Wang Dong, Xu Sanshi, the two of you can return to your rooms first.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong wanted to reject this proposition, but was dragged away by Xu Sanshi. Xu Sanshi shot a look at him, and Wang Dong finally understood what his intention was. It was obvious that Xu Sanshi wanted Wang Dong to follow him to get reinforcements. He only left indignantly upon realizing this. He even shot a look at Huo Yuhao before he left.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan was a little amused as he said, “It’s fine, you don’t have to bring any reinforcements over. Since they have decided to intercept us here, they won’t do anything. This is Star Luo City, and also the place where all the competing members of the tournament are staying.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi chortled and replied, “It’s better to be wary.” As he spoke, he dragged Wang Dong up.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao proceeded to the resting area with Wang Yan. There were only the two weird guys there. While there were many guest going into and out of the hotel, none of them went to the resting area.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Yan sat across from the pair of oddballs. Huo Yuhao asked, “Why are the two of you looking for me? It must be my first time seeing the both of you.”</p>
 <p>The big-headed guy smiled and nodded. He answered, “Of course. But we’ve observed you for quite some time already. If I’m not wrong, your first martial soul, which is also your main martial soul, must be your eyes, and your first soul skill must be something related to spiritual detection, and you can even share it with your compatriots. Through some special method, you’ve also managed to cultivate some kind of shock ability with your spirit. Based on my judgment, it’s like the Purple Demon Eyes from the Tang Sect. Whereas your second soul skill from that martial soul should be something to do with bewitching others. I recall an Iceworm from the north that uses such an ability to hoodwink its opponents. Am I right?”</p>
 <p>The big-headed guy was called Lang Ya. His simple words caused a chill to go up Huo Yuhao’s spine. The feeling of being seen through seemed to have left him completely exposed in front of the other party.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, he was resilient. Although he was shocked, he did not say, “How did you know?”.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Huo Yuhao’s shock, the big-headed guy continued, “Let me introduce myself. My name is Lang Ya. This is my brother, Yu Tao. We are both from the Body Sect. I’m sure you’ve heard of the Body Sect before.”</p>
 <p>Not only did the words ‘Body Sect’ leave Huo Yuhao horrified, but Wang Yan also opened his eyes wide, and his pupils shrank.</p>
 <p>Although the Body Sect rarely appeared in the world of soul masters, they were still very reputable. Among the few strange existences in the world of soul masters, evil soul masters undoubtedly took the top spot. And in terms of peculiarity and power, only the Body Sect could match up to the evil soul masters.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the Body Sect was even more scary than evil soul masters in the eyes of most soul masters. While evil soul masters were powerful, they often appeared alone or in small groups. The Body Sect was a true sect! It was called the most mysterious sect in the world too. It was conceivable how many venerated the powers of the Body Sect.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Yan could never imagine people from the Body Sect appearing in front of them because of the rarity with which they revealed themselves. But now they had come specifically for Huo Yuhao. Wang Yan could figure out what they wanted without even asking them. But the strange thing was that he didn’t seem very nervous.</p>
 <p>Lang Yan smiled at Huo Yuhao and said, “I shall not beat around the bush any further. We are here to bring you back to the sect.”</p>
 <p>“Bring me back?” Huo Yuhao was stunned. He had never joined any sect before!</p>
 <p>Lang Ya nodded and replied, “We’re bringing you back. The Body Sect is the home of all soul masters with body souls. Since your eyes are your martial soul, it means you’re part of the Body Sect. And since we’ve found you, it’s only natural that we’d bring you back.”</p>
 <p>Although Huo Yuhao had heard of the Body Sect a few times before, they were filled with mystery and power. Without a doubt, joining the Body Sect would be very beneficial to his Spirit Eyes. But could he trust these 2 guys who had appeared so suddenly? Even if they could be trusted, could he just leave Shrek Academy?</p>
 <p>Without much consideration, Huo Yuhao shook his head determinedly and said, “Thanks for your offer, but I’m a student of Shrek Academy and a member of Shrek. At the very least, I won’t consider joining any sect before I graduate from the academy.”</p>
 <p>Lang Ya laughed indifferently and said, “Shrek Academy, the best academy? However, they don’t seem too impressive. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have let someone as young as you compete. The Body Sect is the most familiar with body souls, and we’re the most suited to guide you to become the best. With your talent, you will shock the entire world of soul masters within 20 years. Although the Body Sect rarely reveals itself, we will be an unstoppable force once we do so. Your martial soul hasn’t experienced its second awakening, and you have yet to experience the true power of a body soul. Following us back will only be beneficial to you.”</p>
