 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao’s soul core was like a tornado in the sky, then Yan Shaozhe’s soul core was like a huge whirlpool that could devour everything in the ocean. The soul power that it contained was much greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Titled Douluo is indeed a Titled Douluo!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao secretly looked on in awe, he was also reflecting on himself. As his abilities increased, his self-confidence also grew. He was even confident of fighting some Titled Douluo. However, the aura that Yan Shaozhe exuded right now made him fully aware of how inferior he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t that the case? Although he appeared to have controlled the fight earlier, that was because Elder Song was around! If not for her, he would have died against an evil Titled Douluo, even if it was just a duel. If those two evil Titled Douluo had unleashed their full strength right from the start, he wouldn’t have been able to take advantage of them or even handle a fight at that tier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song and Dean Yan were both right. He had to get stronger. After he returned this time, he had to work harder on his cultivation as he learned about soul tools from Teacher Xuan. At the very least, he had to fully absorb the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence in his body first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao was thinking about all that, Yan Shaozhe began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white whirlpool above Nangong Wan slowly descended. The sharp part of it landed directly on Nangong Wan’s dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it touched Nangong Wan’s body, Nangong Wan shuddered and regained consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw the flames on his body as he awoke, he was astonished. He clearly felt that his soul power was quickly seeping out through his dantian. It slowly dissipated, and as it dissipated, it entered another dimension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They, they’re trying to cripple my soul power...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan was horrified as he said, “No, no… you can’t do this!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve harmed so many people,” Yan Shaozhe said coldly, “we are only carrying out justice. We are already being very merciful by not killing you. It’s a good thing to get rid of your abilities as an evil soul master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, no, I beg you! Leave me some soul power! I’ll let you do whatever you want.” To a Titled Douluo, the dissipation of his soul power was too terrifying. He was too used to having great strength. The moment he lost it all would be a worse torment than death itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was moved and asked, “Oh? You’ll let me do whatever I want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan couldn’t move, and could only speak, “Yes, yes. I’ll do anything you want. If you need me to, I can become an undercover agent in the Holy Ghost Church. You can put restrictions on my body. As long as you let me keep my soul power, I’m willing to do anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song furrowed her brow and looked at Yan Shaozhe. On the other side, Huo Yuhao had also slowly opened his eyes. They didn’t expect Nangong Wan to be so spineless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, let me ask you a few questions first.” Yan Shaozhe said. However, the whirlpool was still sucking away his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan answered in pain, “Can you stop sucking away my soul power first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe snorted coldly and said, “As long as a Titled Douluo’s soul core isn’t destroyed, isn’t it easy to restore his soul power? We can leave it like this. It’ll keep you awake, too. Let me ask you now. Answer me as quickly as possible. If you hesitate, I’ll destroy your soul core. You only have one chance. Don’t test my determination.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. Ask me then.” Nangong Wan knew that he was doomed. In front of a Transcendent Douluo, there was no way he could take chances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where’s the Holy Ghost Church’s headquarters?” Yan Shaozhe asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his question, Nangong Wan was stunned, then laughed bitterly. “I can’t tell you. Before I entered the church, all those who are able to enter the headquarters had restrictions placed on them. Once we reveal anything, the restriction will be triggered. Surely you don’t want me to blow apart, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was afraid in his heart. If not for Huo Yuhao’s previous experience, he would have had his doubts. However, he was convinced this time. In spite of this, he remained very stern. “You’re a Titled Douluo. Who can place those restrictions on you?” As he spoke, he immediately strengthened the draw on Nangong Wan’s soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan hurriedly said, “I really can’t say anything. Our Supreme Leader was the one who personally placed the restrictions on us. Apart from her, the sect leader, the vice-sect leader, and the Chief of the Worship Hall, everyone else in the sect has had restrictions placed on them. Once we mention where our headquarters is, we’ll immediately blow up and die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe furrowed his brow. “Does this mean that the Holy Ghost Church can take your life at any time if you betray them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan said, “That won’t happen. It’s not easy placing restrictions on someone to control them. The Supreme Leader’s curse can only be triggered in a very specific way. It’s only when I entertain the thought of revealing that specific place in my head. Apart from that, there won’t be any other effect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So this curse can’t be removed?” Yan Shaozhe asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan laughed bitterly. “It’s not impossible. If someone’s spiritual power is greater than the Supreme Leader’s, this curse can still be removed. However, it’s too difficult. The Supreme Leader is an Ultimate Douluo. She’s too strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe nodded and asked, “Alright, let me ask you then. How many people are there in the Holy Ghost Church? How are they divided?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Nangong Wan didn’t hesitate, and immediately said, “The most powerful figure in the Holy Ghost Church is our Supreme Leader, who is also the Sun Moon Empire’s Death God Douluo. Apart from her, we also have our sect leader and vice-sect leader. They are married. Our sect leader is called Zhongli Wu, while our vice-sect leader is called Feng Ling. We have eight honorary elders below them, who are all Titled Douluo. There are evil soul masters of different tiers underneath these eight elders. Apart from all of us, there are also special people in our church, including the two Holy Ladies. Great hope has been placed on them, they are very talented, and they hold important positions in the church. They’re even more important than the eight honorary elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The evil soul masters in the Holy Ghost Church Worship Hall are the strongest. The Hallmaster of the Worship Hall, who is also the Chief of the Worship Hall, is the Darkness Holy Dragon and Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao. He has eleven others in the Worship Hall under him. They are all Titled Douluo, and five of them are even Transcendent Douluo. Including the Chief, there are twelve of them. Their statuses are very high in the church. Only the Supreme Leader can command them. Even the sect leader can’t do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe and Elder Song looked at each other. They had really benefited greatly from catching Nangong Wan this time. Such information was too valuable to Shrek Academy and the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. Finally, they had some knowledge of the Holy Ghost Church’s internal structure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to Nangong Wan, the Holy Ghost Church had more than twenty Titled Douluo, including two Ultimate Douluo. They were indeed very strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei continued asking from one side, “Why aren’t the eight honorary elders in the Worship Hall if they are Titled Douluo too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan replied, “The Worshipped are hired by the church. They aren’t all evil soul masters. The eight elders have lineages related to the church. That’s why they’re different. Furthermore, those that are evil soul masters in the Worship Hall are all very talented. Their martial souls are very strong. For example, the Scorpion Tiger Douluo Zhang Peng is one of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei asked again, “Apart from you and the Masquerade Douluo, who else from the Holy Ghost Church is at the front line? Is the Masquerade Douluo one of the eight honorary elders?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan answered, “Masquerade is ranked seventh among the elders. Apart from the two of us, the sect leader is also at the front line. There’s the sect leader, a Holy Lady, and six members from the Worship Hall. Excluding me and Masquerade, there are two other honorary elders here. I’m ranked second among the elders. Out of the other two elders, one is the Third Elder, the Dark Lightning Douluo. Although his soul power is only at Rank 92, he’s also a Class 9 soul engineer. His abilities aren’t beneath mine. The other one is the Fourth Elder, the Netherworld Douluo. His martial soul is a Netherworld Sword, and he’s at Rank 93.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the words ‘Third Elder’ and ‘Fourth Elder’, Huo Yuhao suddenly jumped off his seat. A hateful look came over his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for their ambush back then, Wang Qiu’er wouldn’t have needed to sacrifice herself. Huo Yuhao deeply hated the both of them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe squinted and muttered to himself, “The Holy Ghost Church is really relentless! They actually have eleven evil Titled Douluo. This time, we killed one of them and captured another one, but there are still nine left. These evil soul masters are definitely more terrifying than Class 9 stationary soul cannons if they join the war. I remember news from the Heavenly Soul Empire that purported that the borders of the empire were only breached because of the evil soul masters, and the great casualties they caused. The same happened when Heaven Dou City was attacked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao came to the bedside at this moment, suppressing his hatred and asked, “What are your Holy Ladies called? And where are they?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan said, “They have no name. We call them ‘Holy Lady’ directly. The one at the frontline right now is the Bluesilver Holy Lady. The other one, known as the Phoenix Holy Lady, is with the vice-sect leader. The Bluesilver Holy Lady follows the sect leader, as he holds an important position. He stays in the tent next to the central tent in the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion’s area.
