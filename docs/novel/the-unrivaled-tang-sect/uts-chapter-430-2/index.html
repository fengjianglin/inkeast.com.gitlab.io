 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions had already revealed their strength in the war. , They couldn’t rely on traditional methods against such legions anymore. It was only possible to overcome them by unleashing the potential of soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another series of strategies were discussed before Elder Xuan dismissed the conference. Bei Bei and a few deans left together. They needed to get busy preparing for the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion’s formation. Elder Xuan kept Huo Yuhao behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, I’m afraid that you’ll need to return to the front line. You aren’t just the only Ultimate Soldier nurtured by the Academy, you also have immense spiritual detection abilities. Although it’s dangerous, no one can compare to you in terms of your surveillance skills. It’s because of your timely discovery that the Star Luo Empire was able to uncover the Sun Moon Empire’s scheme. Return to the Star Luo Empire and continue to aid them. At the same time, get some of the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools if possible. They will be very important to our future. I have discussed this matter with Teacher Xuan before. He said that producing surveillance soul tools requires a lot of special and rare metals. Only the Sun Moon Empire produces them, especially aerial surveillance soul tools. Can you bring some of them back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “I’ll try my best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You must be careful.” Elder Xuan said with a serious look, “I’m afraid that the strength of that Death God's Ray is something even I can’t bear. I’d be seriously hurt if I was the one resisting it. However, the person unleashing such a powerful attack definitely has to pay a huge price for it. It doesn’t just operate based on soul power, it also involves a fusion of spiritual power. Its strength can even exceed an attack from an Ultimate Douluo. If you have the opportunity, you must uncover the secret of this Death God so that it’s more convenient for us to deal with it in the future. Otherwise, I don’t know how many lives from the Star Luo Empire will be lost before we can tackle it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded seriously. Just like Elder Xuan had mentioned, the entire Star Luo Empire, and even the other empires of the Douluo Continent, would be greatly threatened in the future if this Death God couldn’t be handled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many lives would be lost because of the terrifying strength it possessed! Furthermore, higher-end combat strength would be needed. An ordinary attack wasn’t sufficient to allow the Sun Moon Empire to fire such a powerful soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Go back and discuss things with Teacher Xuan. Although the production method of such a soul tool is very mysterious, there are definitely ways to find out how it was made.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh yes, the Academy will also send a few people to follow you to the front line this time. Otherwise, your powers won’t be sufficient. Furthermore, it’s not very appropriate for you to remain there using the identity of a normal soldier. The Academy will produce a document which will recommend the few of you meet the marshal of the Star Luo Empire’s Northwestern Field Army, the White Tiger Duke. All of you will coordinate with him. You’re from the Star Luo Empire. It’s fine if you undertake a military role.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened and he said, “Elder Xuan, do you mean that we’ll start aiding the Star Luo Empire now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan shook his head and replied, “I don’t consider it to be aiding them. We still can’t touch the higher-end combat strength of the Academy, because the Heavenly Soul Empire might be attacked by the Sun Moon Empire. At this time, the Academy can’t incline itself towards either the Star Luo or Heavenly Soul Empire. Otherwise, tongues will wag. As a result, those who are following you this time will be mostly from the Tang Sect. In my opinion, Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan should follow you. They aren’t that useful when it comes to soul tools, anyway. He Caitou should remain here. Given that Xiao Xiao is so close to He Caitou, she can remain here too. I’ll not touch Bei Bei, so you can choose one more person from the Tang Sect, and the Academy will send one person as well. What do you think about Tang Wutong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Elder Xuan finished speaking, there was already a smiling intent on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned, and revealed a surprised look on his face. In fact, he was also very conflicted. When Elder Xuan said that he should return to the front line, the first feeling that he had was that he was unwilling to do so. There was only one reason… Tang Wutong! It didn’t matter whether Tang Wutong had anything to do with Wang Dong’er and Wang Qiu’er. Her appearance already left Huo Yuhao very conflicted. He was willing to pay any price to remain here. If Tang Wutong was Wang Dong’er, he had to try his best to help her to regain her memories. If she wasn’t, he still had to at least interact with her to be certain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was in a much better mood when Elder Xuan said he was going to send Tang Wutong to the front lines. He hesitated a little before saying, “But didn’t she apply to be a teacher in the Academy? Will there be any problems if she follows us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan smiled and shook his head. He said, “Don’t worry, she isn’t just here to apply for a teaching role. She also wants to apply for a position in the Shrek Guardians. The Academy will use this opportunity to test her, and I’m going to use the excuse that you’re the chief examiner, so she’ll follow your orders. She’s also a Soul Sage, and her abilities aren’t weak. Didn’t you experience them before? As for the sparks that could potentially form between the two of you, and whether she really has lost her memories, that’ll depend on your own efforts to find out. You are so outstanding. Even if Tang Wutong isn’t the same person as Wang Dong’er, I believe you can still successfully chase her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned a bit dimmer, and he shook his head. He said, “Why would I chase her if she’s not Dong’er? But I believe she is! Thanks, Elder Xuan.” As he spoke, he took a step back before bowing seriously to Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan smiled and said, “Silly kid, the Academy will always be your strongest backer, no matter what. Go now. I’ll talk to her immediately. Rest for a day and return to the Tang Sect to choose your people. Tomorrow morning, return here, and take her along with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After leaving the Sea God’s Pavilion, Huo Yuhao bowed towards the Golden Tree once again before he flew across Sea God’s Lake and left the Academy. He rushed towards the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, he was feeling very complex. He was excited, delighted, and even a little uncomfortable. He was most afraid of finding out that Tang Wutong and Wang Dong’er weren’t the same person. If that was the case, all his hopes would be dashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this were the past, he certainly wouldn’t be so nervous about everything. After all, Tang Wutong and Wang Dong’er were simply too alike. However, things were different now. Given there was also a Wang Qiu’er, he was unsure whether Tang Wutong was Wang Dong’er. He had to find out everything for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly returned to the Tang Sect with these feelings. Bei Bei, who had returned to the sect earlier, had already informed everyone, and they were all waiting for Huo Yuhao in the Conference Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little junior!” He Caitou was the first to rush up and gave Huo Yuhao a big hug. Xu Sanshi was next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao opened his arms towards Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao, he was stopped by the both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi fiercely asked, “Rascal, what are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “Of course I’m trying to get closer to my senior sisters! It took me so long before I returned. I must treat everyone the same way, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t even think about it!” Xu Sanshi and He Caitou said at almost the same time. Everyone was so amused that they burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little annoyed as he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Alright, I won’t hug them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi also relaxed his grip on Huo Yuhao and touched him lightly before saying, “Little junior, you should know about Tang Wutong, right? She’s too much like to Dong’er. What’s going on? First, it’s Dong’er. Then, it’s Qiu’er. Now we have a Tang Wutong. Don’t tell me they’re triplets?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he said the word ‘triplets’, his eyes immediately brightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aiyo!” Xu Sanshi screamed immediately after that. One of his ears was already being pulled by a delicate hand. Jiang Nannan said fiercely, “What are you thinking of? Triplets? You’re even salivating. Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi hurriedly laughed, “I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare! Don’t even talk about triplets. Even if there were ten of them, they couldn’t compare to my Nannan! Yuhao, look at you. The moment you return, you cause an internal conflict in my family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone laughed again. Huo Yuhao smiled as he said, “This has nothing to do with me. It’s your own problem.” He paused for a moment before saying, “As for Tang Wutong, I don’t know if she’s Dong’er. However, I believe that I’ll be able to tell if I interact with her more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi said, “Good luck, little junior.

Elder Xuan held me back to tell me that he wanted me to help the Star Luo Empire’s military do some surveillance work. At the same time, he wants me to obtain some aerial surveillance soul tools. Oh yes, I brought one back this time. I’ll send it to Teacher Xuan later.”</span></p>

Ever since Qiu’er sacrificed herself, I took over her power of destiny. Before the Death God's Ray appears, I’ll definitely have some kind of premonition. That transcendent soul tool isn’t much of a threat to me, I’ll be fine as long as I don’t get close to it.&nbsp;</span></p>

The most frightening part about it is that it doesn’t just target one spot. It can perform a sweep, which makes the area that it covers much wider. There’s another mission that I have to perform when I go to the front line this time: find out as much as I can about the Death God's Ray! I’m supposed to find out what happens when it’s fired, and what kind of destruction it brings.”</span></p>
