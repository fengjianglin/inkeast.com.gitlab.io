 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sssss…” The white mist abruptly crashed violently against the Godsealing Altar’s golden light barrier, as if a wail had suddenly appeared in the Hallmaster’s consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hallmaster continued to grin as he said, “You should count yourself lucky, as there are hardly any treasures that are worthy of my emphasis and my cherishment. Do you know what a person’s greatest agony is when he or she has reached the pinnacle? It’s the lack of happiness. I can feel this blissful sensation from you, and I believe this blissfulness will be with me for quite a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was almost midday, and it was still lesson time. Shrek Academy’s main gate felt extremely tranquil today as the myriad of vendors and merchants that would gather here on typical days were all absent. There were five people standing before the enormous gateway.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person standing in front was Shrek Academy’s Martial Soul Deparment’s Dean, Yan Shaozhe, and the Soul Tool Department’s Dean, Xiao Lin’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three people behind them were: the Martial Soul Department’s vice-Dean, Cai Mei’er, the Soul Tool Department’s vice-Dean, Qian Duoduo and the Soul Tool Department’s core teacher, Fan Yu, who was also Huo Yuhao’s mentor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Deans were all present along with Fan Yu, who was almost set to become the Soul Tool Department’s next vice-Dean. This group was substantial and monumental, but they were not accompanied by other teachers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their heads were slightly tilted as they glanced towards the far end of the horizon, and everyone was standing silently in wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several figures that looked like tiny black dots gradually drifted into view one after another in the skies in the distance, and descended from the sky as the five of them looked on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They have returned.” A faint smile broke out on Yan Shaozhe’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xian Lin’er took a step forward and muttered, “They’re finally back.” Her eyes flowed with obvious excitement and exhilaration, and it was a wonder she wasn’t trying to oppose Yan Shaozhe at every available opportunity like normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, the five of them were here to welcome the return of Shrek Academy’s heroes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several figures flitted onto the ground. The first person that came into view was the slovenly-dressed Elder Xuan, and he waved his large hand, and the others descending behind him caught the two stretchers in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was still unconscious on the stretcher, but Jiang Nannan was wide awake. She was so thrilled when she saw the words “Shrek Academy” across the enormous gate that tears of excitement flooded from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they hadn’t even been gone for two months, they had experienced and gone through far too much over these two months.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei and Dai Yueheng caught Xu Sanshi’s stretcher, while Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were responsible for Jiang Nannan’s stretcher. Everybody’s eyes sparkled with excitement, and the younger ones all began to tear up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had been through so much suffering, but they managed to defend Shrek’s honor and glory. They were finally home, and they were finally standing before the main gate that they were so familiar with.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Welcome home, children.” Yan Shaozhe and the others strode forward and welcomed them with open arms. All five of them paid their respects to Elder Xuan as they spoke before they arrived before Shrek Academy’s marvelous students.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe and Cai Mei’er managed to suppress their emotions, but Fan Yu couldn’t control himself, and lunged forward as he pulled Huo Yuhao and He Caitou over. He scrutinized his two dear disciples, and only heaved a sigh of relief after he was sure that they were in one piece.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou swallowed and said, “I didn’t embarrass you master. I didn’t embarrass Shrek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu glanced at him, and then at Huo Yuhao beside him, whose face was flowing with tears, and he grabbed the both of them into a bear hug as he said, “Silly child. I am not afraid of you guys disappointing me – all I wish for is that everyone returns home safely!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This period of time was way too torturous and agonizing for Fan Yu. He wasn’t even supposed to be here, as he was not yet the Soul Tool Department’s vice-Dean.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu hadn’t enjoyed a single day of peace ever since the main team members had returned with heinous injuries, and his heart began to beat out of his chest when Elder Mu decided to let Shrek Academy continue on in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament with an incomplete team. He was extremely aware that the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament wasn’t an entirely safe competition, and participants died almost every time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He only had two direct disciples! Fan Yu and Zhou Yi didn’t have their own children, and he had long treated He Caitou and Huo Yuhao as his own children. There were several times when he wanted to venture into Star Luo City, but was stopped by Qian Duoduo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Fan Yu not be elated, now that his prized disciples had returned home? This hardened man couldn’t help it, and tears cascaded down his cheeks in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Deans shook hands with the group before they personally led them all back into the academy. A small boat was already waiting on the the Sea God’s Lake’s shore.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody exchanged looks with one another as they turned towards the Deans with astonished looks on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe smiled and said, “You have sacrificed so much for the academy. You continued on in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament with an incomplete team, and eventually brought home the championship. This record will forever be etched into Shrek Academy’s history, and the conference held within the Sea God’s Pavilion has decided that everyone shall be rewarded – on the Sea God’s Island, inside the Sea God’s Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Neither Huo Yuhao nor Wang Dong knew what the Sea God’s Pavilion was about, but Dai Yueheng and Ling Luochen were aware, and they instantly reacted with intense shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sea God’s Pavilion was Shrek Academy’s cardinal location for official businesses and meetings, and it was also Shrek Academy’s actual treasury. Shrek Academy’s top secrets were all kept there, and nobody was allowed to enter besides the Sea God’s Pavilion’s Elders and the four Deans under normal circumstances. The opportunity to enter the Sea God’s Pavilion was an incredible honor. Both Dai Yueheng and Ling Luochen had never heard of any student who had been allowed to go inside, and this was the case even for their seniors that participated in the previous Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament and eventually took home the crown.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody got onto the boat, and Yan Shaozhe personally checked Xu Sanshi’s health. He immediately passed on an order for both Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan to remain on Sea God’s Island for treatment and recovery.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao knew that the Sea God’s Pavilion existed, but he didn’t really know anything much about it. He was anxious and excited when he was told that he was about to set foot on the island. Sea God’s Island had something that was touted as the most impressive cradle for soul masters across the entire Continent – Shrek Academy’s inner courtyard!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fact that Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao were able to visit the island at such a young age was enough to excite them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sea God’s Lake’s surface area was immense, and it was far larger than the rest of Shrek Academy added together. The boat pierced through the layers of mist, and the shape of an island gradually drifted into view after about fifteen minutes</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sea God’s Island only appeared to be roughly two square kilometers, and its surface wasn’t flat and smooth at all. Instead, it seemed like a small mountain, with all kinds of buildings constructed upon it. The structures that were usually obscured behind the layers of dense mist finally appeared right before their eyes, and the excitement in their eyes grew ever more radiant.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though everything was unfamiliar and novel, these things were still the stuff of legends to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe didn’t let someone take Xu Sanshi away to rest yet. Instead, he took them all and stepped along a narrow stone path towards the Sea God’s Island’s inner regions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sea God’s Island was extremely quiet, almost as if it were uninhabited. Everything just seemed too tranquil and serene, and the entire place felt like Shangri-la. The various pavilions and structures that were hidden within a myriad of tall and endless vegetation appeared graceful and elegant. This was Huo Yuhao’s first time here, but he fell in love with it at first sight.</span></p>

The air along the trail was fresh, and all that vegetation blocked everyone’s vision. There was a mysterious and enigmatic feeling as they sauntered along the footpath, as if they were just inside the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long for them to reach a position near the mountain summit, and a single pavilion immediately appeared before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a three-story building, and the entire structure was gray and made of wood. It appeared simple and unadorned, yet there were tinges of vicissitudes upon it. One would realize upon closer inspection that there was a layer of grease-like light on the structure’s wooden body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three-story building was about ten meters tall, and it didn’t feel grand or magnificent at all. However, a black horizontal inscribed board hung from the top of the first level’s entrance, and three radiant golden words announced the building’s identity – Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody developed a solemn and respectful feeling as they saw these three words. Judging by the distance, the Sea God’s Pavilion was not only close to the mountain summit, but was also near the island’s center.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe stopped before the Sea God’s Pavilion’s entrance and turned towards the Shrek team members with a faint smile on his face. “I didn’t let Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan rest because I wanted them to have the experience of stepping into the Sea God’s Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned back towards the Sea God’s Pavilion after explaining himself, and he bowed respectfully and said, “They’re back, teacher.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody was taken aback when they heard “teacher”. Both Dai Yueheng’s and Ling Luochen’s faces were stricken with shock, even though they were disciples from the inner courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe was the Martial Soul Department’s Dean, and his status was already extremely high in the minds of the inner courtyard’s disciples. Even Elder Xuan wasn’t as important to them as Yan Shaozhe due to the differences in their responsibilities. Never once did they expect that Yan Shaozhe’s teacher was still alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come in, everyone.” An old voice rang out, and a scene that astonished everyone appeared before their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three-story Sea God’s Pavilion that was just as unassuming as it could be suddenly brightened without warning right before them. Radiant beams of golden light glowed, and the entire pavilion became golden, as if it were a building made entirely from pure gold.</span></p>
