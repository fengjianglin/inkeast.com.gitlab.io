<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Emperor Douluo and Death God Douluo had teamed up. The Dragon Emperor Douluo defended, while the Death God Douluo attacked. Against more than ten soul formations, they didn’t even have any intention of retreating. On the contrary, they even suppressed their enemy. This was a demonstration of their power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao could also tell that this was the furthest they could go, even though they were very strong and powerful. After all, they were humans. Even though they were very strong, it was already very astonishing that could resist the world’s strongest combination of soul tools. However, it was a different story if they really wanted to fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, a huge, black dragon silently appeared below Ye Xishui. It was carrying her. In the next instant, it carried her high into the air. It broke through space just like that before vanishing into the night. This caused the second round of linked attacks to hit nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they avoided the attacks, they weren’t fleeing. They just left. No power was great enough to retain them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was standing in front of her tent. Earlier, she had clearly sensed that she was very, very close to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, news passed that sixty-seven soul engineers from the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion had died. The soul tools at the top of the mountains were greatly damaged. Only half the original strength of the soul formations could be used on now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just an attack by two people. However, that was sufficient to cripple the strongest army on the continent. This was even though the army was at its strongest. What a tragedy this was! But this was power, extreme power that humans could achieve at their limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi suddenly felt fearful. This was her first time having such a feeling. Right now, she truly understood that humans were truly the peak of this world once their abilities reached the peak. Could her army have resisted the two Ultimate Douluo if they had attacked them sneakily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Titled Douluo had their principles. They wouldn’t hurt ordinary people. However, what could they rely on to rule this continent after their greatest fighting strength was wiped out? No wonder there were some who claimed that Ultimate Douluo were the strongest strategic weapons in this world. It was indeed the case! Class 9 shells were far inferior compared to them. Ultimately, Ju Zi lacked such power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi silently returned to her tent. She gave the order to mend the soul formations. At the same time, she also instructed her army to be more alert. The linked defensive formations always had to be half-on. Once any enemy appeared, they were obliged to attack, no matter the price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Revenge was being sought on them. Next, it would depend on how they reacted to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, the Death God Douluo’s attack was undoubtedly just to test their strength. What was next? What would happen in the next fight? Ju Zi didn’t know. For the first time, she felt that her destiny wasn’t in her own hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong continued to lie prone. They only opened their eyes after the fight was over and the Darkness Holy Dragon had concealed himself and the Death God Douluo in space. When they looked at each other, they saw the horror in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it was us, how far could we have gone?” Tang Wutong asked Huo Yuhao a little doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and said, “We’d be able to resist one attack, and that’s only if we have the Goddess of Light.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded gently. That was roughly what she had estimated too. It was only when the Goddess of Light was around that they could resist an all-out attack from the linked offensive soul tools earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Darkness Holy Dragon resisted had five strikes consecutively. The first one was stronger, while the other four were weaker. When Huo Yuhao referred to resisting an attack, he was referring to an attack of the same standard as the first strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Darkness Holy Dragon is too strong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao softly said, “I didn’t expect Elder Long Xiaoyao to be so strong. If I’m not wrong, his cultivation should still be below Ye Xishui.” After learning from his teacher that Long Xiaoyao had in fact been secretly helping him, Huo Yuhao didn’t feel so vengeful towards him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Does your teacher know that you’re complimenting me like this?” A low-pitched voice suddenly sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao subconsciously tightened his grip on Tang Wutong’s hand. Both of them used Instant Teleportation at the same time before they were reappeared a hundred meters away. Immense soul power undulations also instantly rose from their bodies, reaching an extreme state. Both of them revealed horrified looks on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to know that they had been using Imitation to conceal themselves!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black figure silently walked out from space. It was as if he had appeared from thin air. Another blood-red figure followed him out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Death God Douluo appeared even younger now. It was just that her face was very pale. Long Xiaoyao’s aura was also a little unstable, but his eyes weren’t lifeless. Instead, they were glistering like stars in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw how wary Huo Yuhao was, Long Xiaoyao couldn’t help but laugh. “Good, you’ve indeed improved a lot. No wonder Zhong Liwu suffered under your hands. I bet you didn’t expect it. You didn’t expect us to find the two of you, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao silently shook his head and bowed, “Greetings, Dragon Emperor and Death God.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao ignored his greetings and continued speaking, “We only discovered you not because your spiritual power is not concealing you well enough. On the contrary, your spiritual power seems to be greatly accomplished. Even we can’t discover you using our spiritual power. We only discovered you through our senses. You can’t imagine how acute our senses are. You can only fuse with this world once you become an Ultimate Douluo. When that happens, you’ll become part of this world. When something in this world threatens you, you can still trace the source even if you can’t see it. This is how we found you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed a little awkwardly and said, “Both of you are too awe-inspiring and domineering. We are very impressed, and could only cheer you on from afar. We have no ill intentions. If there’s nothing else, we’ll leave.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao turned around with Tang Wutong and was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hold up!” Ye Xishui’s rather hoarse voice echoed. Suddenly, it was as if thousands of avenging spirits were crying sorrowfully. A huge pressure fell from the skies and engulfed Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes suddenly lit up. There seemed to be a boundless night sky and shining stars in the depths of his eyes. His Ultimate Ice aura spread from his body and viciously collided with Ye Xishui’s aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A silent boom echoed through the air. A clash of auras was even more dangerous at their level than a real fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it were someone else with a lower cultivation, he would be instantly crushed into powder if he couldn’t resist Ye Xishui’s overwhelming aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body shook a little, and he took half a step back. Ye Xishui shook slightly, but she didn’t step back. There was also an astonished look in her sinister, ice-cold eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She hadn’t expected this young man to be capable of resisting her pressure. It was also her first time being resisted, apart from Long Xiaoyao. There were even a few kings of soul beasts who had tried before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past few years, Di Tian was the only one who had put her at a disadvantage. However, she had still managed to escape safely, and Huo Yuhao had been critically hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, she could clearly sense that Huo Yuhao hadn’t borrowed Di Tian’s strength, but he was still able to resist her power. This was no longer achievable by a Rank 98 Titled Douluo. Currently, it was as if his strength was at the tier of an Ultimate Doulou!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How is this possible? How old is he? Has he formed his second soul core? Don’t tell me that Zhong Liwu’s words were true?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Emperor Douluo sighed slightly when he saw how astonished Ye Xishui was. “Xishui, don’t be like this. You’ll only scare the kid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui looked coldly at him, “You should meddle less with my business. It seems like little Wu was right. This kid has already comprehended the profundity of second soul cores. He’s relying on their martial soul fusion to forcefully increase his cultivation infinitely close to that of an Ultimate Douluo. I really want to see if he can fight my Death God Pagoda.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, blood-red light shone brightly behind her. Her giant Blood Soul Demonpuppet also surfaced, and the Death God Pagoda reappeared. This time, it was facing Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression changed greatly. He had personally witnessed how powerful the Death God Pagoda was. Right now, it was impossible that he was not anxious facing the Death God Douluo in a duel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xishui!” Long Xiaoyao’s voice became even deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui coldly looked at him. “Are you trying to help him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head and retorted, “Watch your temper! You’ve not changed even after all these years. It’ll be difficult for us to kill them given that we aren’t in our best condition. Since this is the case, why don’t we chat with this young man? You’ve already used your Death God Pagoda twice earlier. If you continue using it, you’ll lose yourself amidst the hostility once again. Do you really want to be like those walking dead that only know how to kill?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I told you that I don’t need you to meddle in my affairs!” Ye Xishui shouted back, “No matter what I become, it has nothing to do with you. Long Xiaoyao, stop being sarcastic here. This kid has already threatened the Holy Ghost Church. If he didn’t severely hurt Little Wu and kill those from the Worship Hall, how could that little thief have gotten what he wanted? Do you know how long it has taken for the Holy Ghost Church to become as powerful as it is right now? Now, that bastard Xu Tianran wants to seize this opportunity to get rid of us. I want to let him witness what our true strength is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao was a little helpless as he shook his head. He said, “Alright, stop playing. If you stay like this, I’ll leave forever.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he suddenly started to cough. Although his coughing wasn’t very loud, it caused Ye Xishui’s expression to change greatly. Her earlier hostility suddenly disappeared. She immediately patted his back gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiaoyao, Xiaoyao, don’t be so uptight. What’s wrong? Calm down. Are you okay?” Ye Xishui asked concernedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao sighed as he turned slightly pale. “I’m too old. My blood isn’t flowing very well. If I was at my peak, I wouldn’t have been drained so much from those earlier attacks. But I’m not hurt yet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you hurt?” Ye Xishui was astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but say, “Elder Long, you faced the linked attacks of more than ten soul engineer legions of the Sun Moon Empire. Their offensive strength was too strong. It’s already unbelievable that a human can resist it. Moreover, you resisted it many times.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui’s expression turned gentler. It was evident that she wasn’t very well mentally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, Xiaoyao, don’t be anxious. I’ll listen to you. I’ll not harm those two kids.” As she spoke, her Blood Soul Demonpuppet vanished. Her fierce and aggressive aura also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s eyes were still very bright as he looked at Huo Yuhao. He wasn’t affected just because his aura was weaker now. He stared at Huo Yuhao passionately and asked, “Have you formed your second soul core?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao silently nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao took in a deep breath and said, “According to what I know, you are the only soul master in the past few thousand years who has cultivated a second soul core before becoming an Ultimate Douluo. You’re still so young too. I see hope in you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “No, I’m not the only one. Wutong has also succeeded.” He didn’t hide anything or tried to bluff Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like Long Xiaoyao was able to find them using his senses, Huo Yuhao could sense something special coming from him for some unknown reason. This feeling developed his trust towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She also has one?” Long Xiaoyao was stunned as he looked at Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes! I also thought of that. Unless she formed her second soul core, how could both of you have maintained your martial soul fusion? Very good, both of you are very good. No wonder you’re Mu En’s disciples.” Long Xiaoyao’s smile was very genial. However, Huo Yuhao felt that it was very strange. It was just like Elder Mu was acting before he had passed on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was astonished.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Don’t tell me that the Dragon Emperor Douluo is also…</span></p>
