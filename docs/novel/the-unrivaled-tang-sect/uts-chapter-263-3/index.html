However, Huo Yuhao still felt that it was too short. There were two paragraphs of a touching love story. The first paragraph introduced the possible origin of the Yearning Heartbroken Grass. The other paragraph recorded the love story of Tang San and his wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang San’s story touched Huo Yuhao more, as he understood the life of a soul master. When he saw the word ‘sacrificed’, he felt his blood surging in his body. Their love must have been very deep for Tang San’s wife to sacrifice herself to become a soul ring! Humans could actually get together with soul beasts. Although Tang San only briefly mentioned how the grass was his benefactor, Huo Yuhao knew that the backstory wasn’t so simple. Only Tang San would know how much pain and torment they went through back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After taking a deep breath, Huo Yuhao calmed himself down. Wang Dong’er’s beauty filled his mind at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong’er, I’d also sacrifice myself as a soul ring if I were a soul beast, and protect you forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought until here, he revealed a grin on his face. Her beautiful figure in his mind also became clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After calming himself down, Huo Yuhao started to quietly flip through the Tang Sect’s record in his hand. In addition to his impressive memory, his spiritual power was also considerable He only flipped through the entire book once, but he managed to memorize all its contents. Then, to make sure he didn’t miss out on certain points, he read it again. After that, he stood up and returned the book to the Delicate Silk Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You You, can you tell me about the various plants that were introduced in the book?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Perhaps it was because Huo Yuhao returned her Delicate Silk Immortal Pill, she agreed to his request readily. Under her guidance, Huo Yuhao managed to learn more about the various magical plants in this Icefire Yin Yang Well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one understood this place like the Delicate Silk Immortal. She even clearly told Huo Yuhao about some soul plants that weren’t recorded in the book.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They only stopped when darkness fell.</span></p>

She only lowered her head and started to munch on her food quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked at her and smiled. He said, “Thanks, Qiu’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was a little startled She lifted her head to look at him, and saw the clear light in his eyes. For some reason, she shivered slightly in her heart when she saw the look in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. An ominous feeling started to rise inside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s senses were not inferior to Huo Yuhao’s, since she possessed the Golden Dragon’s Perception. She suddenly felt that he wasn’t ostracizing her anymore, and didn’t try to keep his distance from her. The look in his eyes was extremely calm and amiable as he looked over. He treated her as a friend now. Yes, he treated her only as a friend now, a good friend one treats with respect. However, this was what made Wang Qiu’er anxious, because he was no longer afraid of what had happened between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After receiving Niu Tian’s letter, Huo Yuhao entered the Setting Sun Forest and came to the Icefire Yin Yang Well, where he finally obtained the mysterious record after going through many ordeals. To him, everything was a test of his heart. He was training his heart throughout the entire process, and his love for Wang Dong’er became deeper and deeper. Huo Yuhao felt that his heart had become clearer after he read about Tang San and Xiao Wu’s love and sacrifice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clarity also helped him realize why he was terrified of Wang Qiu’er. It was because the Goddess of Light had left a deep impression in his heart, which made him afraid of her. He was afraid that he would fall in love with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this crisis had also helped him recognize his true feelings. In his heart, there was only one person and one Goddess of Light. That person was Wang Dong’er. After recognizing his true feelings, he didn’t need to worry about other things anymore. He could face her normally now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s there to thank me for? I didn’t do anything. You managed everything on your own,” Wang Qiu’er said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Thanks for accompanying me here. I will remember this favor. If you need help in the future, you can tell me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er snorted, “No need. Since you have so much energy to talk nonsense, I suggest that you use it on eating and cultivating. With your current state, I don’t even think you can control a flying-type soul tool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Huo Yuhao was already used to her indifferent attitude, and so wasn’t too bothered by it. He quickly consumed his meal before starting to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three days! Huo Yuhao took three days to learn of all the plants in the Icefire Yin Yang Well. This place contained more than two-thirds of the immortal and poisonous grasses recorded in the Hidden Weapons Hundred Separation’s medicine and poison chapters. This place deserved to be called a blessed land. There were some plants that weren’t recorded in the chapters, but the Delicate Silk Immortal introduced them to Huo Yuhao in detail. With her help, Huo Yuhao managed to turn a special herb into a concoction, and he recorded it at the back of the record.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, your memory is astounding. I have taught you everything I know. You are a good student.” After a few days of interaction, the Delicate Silk Immortal and Huo Yuhao had also become more familiar with each other. Although she was rather naggy, she was actually quite a peaceful character. She also formed a decent friendship with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded, then turned his head in a certain direction. It was the area where the Yearning Heartbroken Grass grew. He had seen the divine products created by the grass before, but he didn’t rush out after it. He memorized the special characteristics of the surrounding herbs instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thanks, You You. Can I start now?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She replied, “Anytime. As long as you think it’s possible, you can do it. After that, you can take away seven different types of herbs from this place too. If they have successfully turned into plant-type soul beasts, you can categorize their finished products based on their medicinal effects. For example, there’s my pill and Ah Jiao’s rubber. These are the rules that Tang San left behind. In fact, the pill and rubber would have been included among the seven if you didn’t return them to us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought for a moment before saying, “Is the Fullmoon Piercing Autumn Dew that I’ve eaten included?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal’s pink flowers swayed a little, and she said, “No. It was used to test you. If you didn’t pass the test, nothing would have followed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao immediately said without hesitation, “I only want to take two things away today, the Yearning Heartbroken Grass and the Blazing Rubber. As for the other five types, I’ll come in the future when I need them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright. Why don’t you want my pill? It can neutralize countless poisons; it’s very useful.” The Delicate Silk Immortal was advertising her own ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao answered, “I’m not going to need it now. I’ll leave these five chances for the future. If my partners or friends need emergency help in the future, it’ll be convenient for me to find suitable herbs here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Delicate Silk Immortal said, “What about the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass? It’s very suitable for you. It’ll greatly increase your cultivation. To be conservative, I expect it to increase your soul power by at least five ranks. It absorbed the extreme cold from the Extreme Chill Icespring and the Frigid Raindew separated from it is more effective than the Blazing Rubber.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and smiled. “Ancestor Tang San said that we can’t be greedy. I have already absorbed the Fullmoon Piercing Autumn Dew, and I also obtained the origin energy of heaven and earth absorbed by the Snow Empress from the Extreme Chill Icespring. I can’t take more for myself. The origin energy will take some time to fully digest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke til this point, he laughed bitterly. The origin energy absorbed in his body was too immense. It was so immense that even the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s skeleton was filled with extremely pure energy. Huo Yuhao’s own body was like a receptacle that was completely filled. If he wasn’t careful, he might blow apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had to be extremely cautious in his cultivation right now. He could only activate the circulation of his soul power through his narrow meridians to absorb the origin energy for his own use. His meridians were also under great pressure, to the extent of being internally hurt because he was being continually struck by the origin energy of the Extreme Chill Icespring. It was even difficult for his Life Gold’s immense life power to restore his body. Huo Yuhao felt that the Snow Empress had used his body’s limit as a blueprint when she was absorbing the origin energy earlier.</span></p>

In addition, it would be much easier for him to absorb the remaining origin energy once he reached that stage.</span></p>

This time, he had completely tempered his body into an Ultimate Ice body. This was also the intention of the Snow Empress, and it would be very beneficial for his future development. The Skydream Iceworm told him that he wouldn’t suffer from the repercussions of wielding Ultimate Ice once he managed to absorb all the origin energy. After he absorbed it completely, it might even help him obtain a Martial Soul True Body. The only problem was that he had no idea how long it would take for him to absorb it all. Furthermore, his cultivation was currently stuck at three rings, as he couldn’t overactivate his soul power. Just as Wang Qiu’er had said, he couldn’t even command a flying-type soul tool.</span></p>
