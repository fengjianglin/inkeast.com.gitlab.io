 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Er Bai did not continue and kill the Abomination Douluo. Huo Yuhao had obviously ordered Er Bai to pin him down, but not kill him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo knew the battle was over. There was no point in him trying to fight a losing battle. As his figure flickered, he sent the remaining avenging spirits around him on a final onslaught. The mermaid avenging spirit released a series of loud howls as its powerful spiritual attack rippled from its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To protect his life, the Myriad Soul Douluo knew he had to sacrifice his avenging spirits to escape. He could always replenish his avenging spirits if they were to die. But if he were to lose his life, it would be the end for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His reactions were extremely quick, but why would Huo Yuhao not have thought of restraining him? He would not have left him there alone if he didn’t have the ability to control the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as the Myriad Soul Douluo was retreating, he suddenly saw a strange eye in front of him. The humongous eye released a purplish-gold flash before his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, the Myriad Soul Douluo felt as if a hammer which could have split the earth hit his head. After releasing a loud groan, his retreating body lost control and collapsed to the ground with a loud thud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a spiritual shock from the martial soul true body version of the Eye of the Asura! The frighteningly powerful spiritual attack ensured the destruction of the Myriad Soul Douluo’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the huge loss of his avenging spirits, the Myriad Soul Douluo had already suffered a drop in his cultivation. After sustaining this blow, he immediately lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pure white holy light instantly transformed into a sharp sword which descended from the sky as though it was about to judge the evil beneath it. The sword stabbed straight into the chest of the Myriad Soul Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Ye Guyi’s body split from the holy sword. Afterwards, one could see copious amounts of grey energy current surging out from the chest of the Myriad Soul Douluo. While he was screaming in pain, he was unable to budge because he was pinned down by the holy sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four wings behind Ye Guyi’s black glistened like white jade as golden streaks of energy raced into her body from the hilt of the holy sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tonight’s battle was definitely a night full of rewards for this Soul Sage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo struggled for close to a minute before relenting. Finally, he transformed into black ash under the holy sword before vanishing. After breaking free from their master’s control, the remaining avenging spirits in the air were about to disperse and escape before they were stopped by Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi immediately turned around to continue her attack. She took close to fifteen minutes before she was able to purify the bulk of the avenging spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the avenging spirits, about a third of them were human. The rest of them were from soul beasts. While some of them were from the land, most of them were aquatic soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, Huo Yuhao ask Ye Guyi to spare the mermaid avenging spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit was putting up a fierce struggle against Huo Yuhao’s spiritual interference domain. Its once beautiful face was now twisted by rage and hatred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a long sigh before chanting a purification spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s purification was a level above Ye Guyi’s because he himself had inherited the power from Electrolux.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A white light shone down from the skies and onto the mermaid avenging spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that very instant, the spirit stopped struggling as streams of black energy current separated from its soul. The hatred and anger which were written all over its face started to slowly disappear. Gradually, all that remained on its face was melancholy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao released his spiritual power and attempted to establish contact with the mermaid. However, the mermaid spirit merely looked at him as it gently shook its head. Its eyes were brimming with sadness, but one could tell that it was a kind of sadness which one possessed after coming to terms with one’s predicament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid nodded gently before opening her mouth to sing a melody.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the battle within the city had ended. Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi and Ji Juechen were all coming back from different directions. However, they all heard the mermaid spirit’s singing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her singing was beautiful, but sorrowful. It sounded as though she was sobbing as she shared her tragic story of being captured by the evil soul master through her song. Her spirit started to release spots of white light during her singing. As her voice became brighter, her body started to become fainter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, she had already become an avenging spirit!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he were to help her remove her vengeance, she was still unwilling to communicate with him. Nonetheless, her soul was purified, and she must be feeling a lot better now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid’s singing lasted for a couple of minutes before diminishing to silence. As the last note was sung, everyone’s eyes were brimming with tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This mermaid spirit was particularly skilled in spiritual power. She was one of the strongest avenging spirits that the Myriad Soul Douluo had possessed. Now, during her last song, she was able to move everyone present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid’s faint spiritual image turned around to face Huo Yuhao before bowing before him, as though she wanted to thank him for his help. Following which, a pale blue glow started to fly towards him. Once the glow started to move towards him, the spirit disintegrated into tiny white particles that vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could sense the kindness from the mermaid spirit, and extended his hand to receive the blue light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To his surprise, the blue light went through his palm before landing on his body. As the blue light enveloped him, Huo Yuhao felt as though he had been rinsed by warm water. He felt particularly refreshed, but nothing else other than that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was confident that he would be able to detect any problems with his powerful spiritual energy if there were any. But from the way things looked, there didn’t seem to be any problem with the gift from the mermaid spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Abomination Douluo who was temporarily “spared” by Er Bai was naturally Huo Yuhao’s gift to Ye Guyi. Without hesitating, Ye Guyi moved over to finish him off with her holy sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The deaths of different evil soul masters gave her different degrees of improvement. Even though she gained a lot from the death of the Abomination Douluo, the power she gained was a lot less than what she had received from the Myriad Soul Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After putting her holy sword away, Ye Guti realized the holy fire that was burning around her body was almost beyond her control. Even Er Bai refused to be in close proximity to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.” Ye Guyi thanked Huo Yuhao before walking straight to the spectral gate behind him. She had purified far too many avenging spirits, and her body was bursting with purified energy. She needed to train immediately to digest this energy, or it would be wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle on the walls of the city was nearing its end. Under the combined attack of two hundred soul engineers, each at least a Soul Emperor, the resistance above the walls of the city was destroyed in no time. Even though they had tried to retaliate with their linked soul tools, which were controlled by fifty soul masters, their attack was very feeble, considering how they had to defend at the same time. They simply could not breach the linked defense set up by the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The linked defense on the city wall was destroyed by the furious attacks of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, He Caitou was saddened to see so many soul tools destroyed in the battle! They were all precious soul tools which were very valuable!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large commotion at the city walls naturally attracted the attention of Eastern Sun City’s City Defense Army as they gravitated towards the walls. However, it was apparent that they would be of not much use. The Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion spread out in the air as they fired at the main road which led to the city walls. The series of shots completely cut off the road the army was about to take to provide reinforcement to the walls without taking too many lives. Otherwise, it would just be a one-sided massacre if the army were to actually come into direct conflict with the soul engineer legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei moved towards Huo Yuhao and said, “Who would have known that there would be two evil Titled Douluo? Fortunately, we had the two of you to take them down.” Even though he was mainly expressing his gratitude towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, he was also expressing his amazement at the current strength of the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he hadn’t managed to witness the full battle earlier, he could tell that Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao had won the battle fairly easily from their composed expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them were authentic Titled Douluo, and yet they could not put up a fight against Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. In fact, Huo Yuhao was even able to control the situation, and allow Ye Guyi to improve her cultivation. Compared to the battle at Oak City which had a few unexpected incidents, things went pretty smoothly this time. This exemplified how strong the Tang Sect had become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the past few battles, everyone, including Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, had a brand new understanding of their own abilities. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could probably put up a fight against the Heavenly Sun Douluo—who was a Rank 97 Transcendent Douluo!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The advantage of using martial soul fusion skills on their top-class martial souls was becoming increasingly apparent as Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong became stronger. At the same time, the gap between them and their peers was also becoming larger. Without the Qiankun Fortune Pills, the gap between them would probably have been larger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior brother, clear up the battlefield!” Huo Yuhao ordered He Caitou. This was He Caitou’s favourite part of the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, Huo Yuhao first located the equipment which was connected to the nearby aerial surveillance soul tools before shutting the surveillance soul tools down and bringing them in. Afterwards, he chanted his incantations to open a spectral gate and release the remaining two legions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the soul engineers came out of the spectral demiplane without their soul tools. After all, the dismantling work only required human labor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle at Eastern Sun City was different from the one back at the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Here, at the biggest city in the northern region of the Sun Moon Empire, Huo Yuhao and the others did not have to flee right after they attacked as they did at the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Even if news of their attack spread to other troops, it would take a long time for reinforcements to arrive. Thus, they could plunder the city at will.</span></p>
