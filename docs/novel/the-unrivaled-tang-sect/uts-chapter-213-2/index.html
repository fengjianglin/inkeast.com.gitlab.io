 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could tell that while Huo Yuhao wasn’t old, he seemed very mature—even more so than most of the male students earlier. His eyes were also exceedingly clear. Although he wasn’t particularly handsome, there was a certain aura surrounding him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snow Lady, come on out,” Huo Yuhao suddenly called out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a streak of orangish-gold light emerged from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Amidst the pitch-black darkness of night, the lights from soul rings were already very dazzling. However, this orangish-gold light was even more dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this orangish-gold light appeared, the beams of light beneath the female students seemed to dim in comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment, the Snow Lady drifted in front of Huo Yuhao. Still engulfed in the orangish-gold light, she turned to look at Huo Yuhao and rubbed her eyes sleepily with her small, white hands. She was evidently not fully awake yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wow, even a kid’s here for a blind date?” An unknown female student exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo said, “Don’t spout nonsense, that’s no ordinary kid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was telepathically connected to the Snow Lady and caressed her head. When the Snow Lady saw the surrounding lights, she blinked and was instantly jolted awake. A look of excitement had appeared in her deep blue eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya!” The Snow Lady shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t open his mouth to speak. Rather, he directly communicated with her through his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zha zha ya ya!” The Snow Lady shouted again, then flew towards the ladies. Her first target was Han Ruoruo, who stood in the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had snow-white skin, a feeling of delicateness, and was adorably chubby. Her big, beautiful eyes even seemed capable of reflecting the stars in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back when she’d been in the Clear Sky Sect, even the two sect masters hadn’t been able to resist her charms. These young ladies were no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wow, so cute! Come on over, come on over!” Wu Ming was the first to gesture towards the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe~” The Snow Lady laughed mischievously, but continued towards Han Ruoruo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yi yi ya ya?” She said to Han Ruoruo before extending her arms, as if she was asking for a hug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Women all had maternal instincts—especially Wu Ming and Han Ruoruo, who were over thirty years old. Their maternal instincts had kicked in the moment they saw the cute Snow Lady!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo didn’t even hesitate before opening her arms wide and hugging the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady’s body was fresh and cool, and her skin was soft and elastic. Han Ruoruo couldn’t help but let out a comfortable sigh. Hugging the Snow Lady felt so great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Han Ruoruo knew that she wasn’t an ordinary kid, she couldn’t help but comment, “Why didn’t you dress her in warmer clothes? Her body feels so cold.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “I can’t decide what she wears.” The Snow Lady created her own clothes; it wasn’t something that Huo Yuhao could decide. Furthermore, the Snow Lady was a Spirit converted from the Icesky Snow Lady. Of course her body was cold…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady gave Han Ruoruo a hug and then crawled out from her arms. She turned to look at Huo Yuhao before turning to look at Han Ruoruo with a pitiful expression on her face and lifted her pinkie to point at the hat above Han Ruoruo’s head and exclaimed once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, she lowered her head and wore an indignant look on her face. She pointed her two index fingers in front of her; she was the picture of cuteness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how tough Han Ruoruo was, she instantly became gentle in front of the Snow Lady. Although she couldn’t understand what the Snow Lady was saying, she understood what she was trying to convey through her actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, alright, don’t be sad. I’ll take it off.” Once she’d finished speaking, she lifted her hand and took off her hat. Her appearance was exposed immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo appeared much younger than her age and was a beauty. Her eyes were pitch-black and her face was thin, but at this moment, her eyes were full of gentleness as she reached out in front of the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Han Ruoruo removed her hat, the Snow Lady laughed and pecked her cheek. She then flipped around and made her way towards a female student off to Han Ruoruo’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She proceeded to do the same as before: She pointed at the female student’s hat and exclaimed pitifully. Afterwards, she lowered her head and pointed her index fingers in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, it wasn’t just the female students who were stunned. The elders, teachers, and male students were all stunned as they watched this strange scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei’s eyes widened, while Zhang Lexuan was moved—her eyes were filled with a sense of gentleness. Without a doubt, she would’ve made the same choice as Han Ruoruo if she’d been in her place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second hat was removed just like that as another female student revealed their appearance. Huo Yuhao was surprised to find out that he knew this female student; she was the ice-type soul master that had fought alongside him in the Elite Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, Ling Luochen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady laughed cheekily and gave her a peck too. Ling Luochen seemed to be in a daze as she looked at the Snow Lady. She then looked at Huo Yuhao again, her gaze filled with doubt, as if she was asking Huo Yuhao, W</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">hat’s going on!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady’s charm was invincible. She used the same method on three more female students, succeeding every time. Three more female students had their appearances exposed, just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was surprised to find out that he knew two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Xiao was beside Ling Luochen. After two and a half years, Xiao Xiao’s appearance had changed drastically; she was much better-looking than before. As she was only a little older than Huo Yuhao, she’d still seemed very undeveloped two years ago. However, she was a head taller now, although her figure was relatively still the same. This was the classic post-puberty look. Her ravishing looks had also became even prettier as she developed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She’d succumbed under the Snow Lady’s charm and had even stretched out her arms to hug her a second time, but the Snow Lady had avoided her. When she had, she’d almost fallen into the water because of her carelessness. She was only saved by the Snow Lady, who gave her a helping hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other female student Huo Yuhao recognized wasn’t a close friend. She had long, scarlet hair and a cool expression. She was Wu Feng, who possessed the Red Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Feng had naturally possessed a slender figure, but it was devilish now. Her curves were definitely the most exaggerated amongst the seventeen female students. Her figure was similar to Ma Xiaotao’s figure from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She appeared a little stunned as she looked at the Snow Lady. When she turned to look at Huo Yuhao, she appeared as unfriendly as ever. Even though she was quite hot-tempered, even she’d evidently become gentler when her gaze met the Snow Lady’s deep blue eyes.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Snow Lady, come back.” Huo Yuhao hadn’t wanted to take down this many hats. It was embarrassing! So many people were currently looking at the pair of them. He had to at least give the other male students a chance. If he took down all of the hats, he’d certainly steal the limelight. However, he was still bound to become everyone’s target.</span></p>

She then sat on his shoulder and started to play with his hair.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, you’re Huo Yuhao, right? What’s with this little lady? You owe us an explanation!” Wu Ming couldn’t help but ask. Everyone looked at him eagerly, regardless of whether their hats had been taken off or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled mysteriously and said, “Today is the Sea God’s Fate; I can’t possibly delay everyone now. I’ll explain everything once the event ends. I can only say that all of you can possibly own someone like the Snow Lady in the future, if you’re willing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he’d finished speaking, he slowly retreated across the water. He only turned around after retreating a few steps. He lightly crossed the water’s surface as he quickly returned to the water lily that he was on previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the male students’ gazes followed him back. They could also see the Snow Lady clearly as he got closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian gave Huo Yuhao a thumbs-up as she said, “My friend, you’re quite impressive! You took off five hats easily. In my opinion, you would have been able to take off all their hats if you wanted to! You’re too strong. Furthermore, you didn’t just take off their hats, you also left a good impression on all of them. No wonder you were able to enter the inner courtyard at such a young age. Impressive!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and didn’t send the Snow Lady back inside of him. He said to Chu Qingtian, “I was just playing tricks brother Chu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Qingtian also laughed. “Playing tricks? I want to play tricks just like you, but I’d need that cute little girl that you have! What is she exactly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t beat around the bush this time. He could clearly tell that the male students were all eager to hear his explanation. He replied, “She’s a Spirit. How do I put this… she’s a special life that I created because of a twist of fate. She’s like a body of energy that combined with my spiritual mind, and who’s slightly connected to me by blood. Simply put, she’s another form of soul ring that possesses life. She’s my partner.”</span></p>

They were all talented students from Shrek Academy, and most of them were from the Martial Soul Department; their understanding of a soul master’s capabilities were all very deep. However, none of them knew that soul masters could possess such a life existence. The Snow Lady was an existence that soul rings couldn’t compare to! &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
