I’ll wait for you in the northern direction outside of the forest. Remember, you only have 4 hours. I can tell you that the Great Star Dou Forest is very close to Shrek City. I’m hopeful a full-blown conflict won’t happen unless it’s necessary. But this doesn’t mean that I’m fearful of war.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions on the Scarlet King’s three heads changed repeatedly. Its teeth moved a little as it stared at the indifferent Elder Xuan, “Alright, I’ll believe you this time.” After it finished speaking, it didn’t delay any longer. Its figure flashed and it changed into a streak of dark red light before disappearing instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan rode the Three-Eyed Golden Lion, while Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao’s anxiety had disappeared. They wanted to search for Huo Yuhao in the direction he had unleashed his aura, but were stopped by Elder Xuan. Elder Xuan shook his head slightly at them. His eyes moved slightly, and he nodded his head after a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already snuck over before Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao went to find him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scarlet King and Elder Xuan’s confrontation was over, thus he didn’t need to restrict his movements anymore. He snuck over since there was no longer any tension over here. In addition, the Skydream Iceworm also told him that the powerful savage beast had left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Xuan!” Huo Yuhao was overjoyed as he saw Elder Xuan on the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. He even initiated his soul tool thruster to rush over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t talk to me!” Elder Xuan snapped, “You almost scared me to death. What happened just now? Why did you disappear after unleashing your hundred thousand year soul beast aura?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly as he recounted how he had to unleash the aura against the Twin Cyclops to preserve his own life, as well as his encounter with the Three-Eyed Golden Lion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan’s expression turned weird after hearing his words. He took a look at the Three-Eyed Golden Lion that he sat on and patted its head. He said, “It’s been tough for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-Eyed Golden Lion seemed to recover a little and looked at Elder Xuan coldly. It started to speak in the human tongue, and it even sounded like a lady with a moving voice, “Despicable humans. If you dare to harm me, I’ll make sure you regret it, and that misfortune will befall you all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan chuckled and slapped his palm against the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s head. This caused the lion to be pressed into the ground. Elder Xuan even exerted more force to make it kiss the soil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Threatening me? Don’t think that I don’t know about Emperor Beasts like you even though it’s my first time seeing one. You carry a special blood lineage from ancient times, and you can use this blood lineage’s aura to influence the undulations of spiritual air in the heavens and earth. It’s just nonsense when they say that you beget prosperity. And you still dare to threaten me with misfortune? Do you believe that I won’t torture you till the brink of death? The soul beasts treat you as a treasure. If I kill you, they may really attack the humans out of rage. But don’t think that you’re real nobility. No matter how well those hundred thousand year soul beasts treat you, you’re only a treasure to them. You’re not their emperor. Your title as an Emperor Beast only sounds nice. Regardless of whether you’re human or a soul beast, it’s best if you know your place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You, you’re the one spouting nonsense.” The Three-Eyed Golden Lion sounded more agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan laughed coldly. “Spouting nonsense? I’m already being very kind here. How do you think they’d treat you if you were useless to them, or if they believed that your meat gives them immortality? Yuhao, come over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Press your forehead against this Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s third eye. Don’t worry, I’ll stop it from resisting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! Don’t you dare!” The Three-Eyed Golden Lion was enraged and roared furiously. It tried to struggle, which caused golden-red blood to ooze from its mouth due to an internal injury it had sustained earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned, and said, “Elder Xuan…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan chortled and said, “There’s a record in an ancient collection that Shrek Academy obtained from ancient times which propagates the Emperor Beasts’ dominance. They beget prosperity and possess unlimited potential. What this means is that Emperor Beasts can protect soul beasts and enhance their speed of cultivation. Different Emperor Beasts are different elements. Just like this Three-Eyed Golden Lion here. It has many elements. When I attacked it just now, I could sense the light and fire elements in its body. However, they aren’t its main elements, although they are close to the level of ultimate elements. Its main element is its spiritual power. If not for its spiritual power, I would have already killed it. Elemental transfusion refers to its ability to enhance your element using its own element. This is very beneficial for your future cultivation. But it’s a little vague when we refer to its ability to beget prosperity and its possession of unlimited potential. We aren’t sure what benefits it can bring, so it can only be comprehended through one’s own self. Hurry up. Stop moving.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His last sentence was directed at the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. The Three-Eyed Golden Lion wanted to speak, but it couldn’t as Elder Xuan pressed its head into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally believed in Elder Xuan’s words. He slowly pressed his forehead against the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s vertical eye as he looked into its fiery-looking eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s powers were completely repressed by Elder Xuan. Elder Xuan didn’t know that the Three-Eyed Golden Lion would definitely kill itself without any hesitation if it still possessed a shred of strength. Elder Xuan also didn’t know what elemental transfusion entailed for Emperor Beasts. Even the Skydream Iceworm and Ice Jade Empress Scorpion didn’t know. It was the Emperor Beasts’ biggest secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No soul beast dared to unravel this secret in the world of soul beasts. The title of the Three-Eyed Golden Lion as an Emperor Beast wasn’t as lowly as Elder Xuan described it to be. No soul beasts dared to get close to it. The Three-Eyed Golden Lion was very violent. Whoever dared to get close to it would be ferociously and maniacally attacked by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both of their bodies trembled violently when Huo Yuhao’s forehead pressed against the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Life opened as it was lured out by the magical powers contained within the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s vertical eye. However, Elder Xuan, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao couldn’t see it, because his forehead was pressed against the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt that his mind had gone empty after trembling for a while. Even his Spiritual Sea seemed to disappear. The Skydream Iceworm, Ice Empress and Electrolux decided to shrink their powers at the moment and hide in one corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rings of weird, distorted light engulfed Huo Yuhao and the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s body. Their bodies seemed to become transparent as a subtle radiance flashed. Every time the radiance changed, Huo Yuhao and the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s bodies would twitch slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The immense life aura contained within Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Life rapidly flowed out and entered the Three-Eyed Golden Lion’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The injuries that the Three-Eyed Golden Lion sustained earlier healed at an alarming speed. The entire Great Star Dou Forest started to shake tremendously, with Huo Yuhao and the Three-Eyed Golden Lion at the center of this tremor. An intense life aura surged towards them and into their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distorted radiance became stronger and stronger, engulfing the both of them within. A special force prevented even Elder Xuan from breaching this radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was a little discomforted as he witnessed this amazing change. He muttered to himself, “Did we really escalate the situation? This Three-Eyed Golden Lion was still struggling earlier. Don’t tell me this transfusion will take its life away? That would be disastrous. Will the Star Dou’s soul beasts go all-out against Shrek? That will cause many casualties! Why is there such a huge reaction?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong furrowed his brows, and golden light flashed in his eyes. He felt something weird as he looked at the distorted radiance. It was as if something that belonged to him was being taken away. But the feeling was very mild, and he couldn’t sense it clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s consciousness was gradually restored, while his Spiritual Sea became active again. He was stunned to realize that there was something more in his Spiritual Sea. The size of his Spiritual Sea seemed to double. A subtle aura appeared to be within his Spiritual Sea, his Eye of Life had transformed as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Eye of Life usually emitted green light. To him, it was only a place that Electrolux stayed in. It also helped him preserve a shred of spiritual power. The Life Guardian Blade was also there, and it could be used by him at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was different now. Huo Yuhao could clearly feel that he really owned a third eye now. His Eye of Life had turned bright gold under his control. The Life Guardian Blade had also been extracted, and landed on the ground. The Life’s Gold life aura was still on the Life Guardian Blade. Electrolux’s awareness had also returned to his own Spiritual Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also meant that the Eye of Life had become his third eye, and was now fully under his control. He could also clearly feel that there was another magical force within his third eye.
