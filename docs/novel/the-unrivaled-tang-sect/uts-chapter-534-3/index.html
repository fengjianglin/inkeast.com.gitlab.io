 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If they are automatic linked defensive soul tools, Teacher Xuan discovered that it takes around two to three seconds before the entire soul formation is activated after the soul tools are triggered. This will differ depending on the quality of the linked soul tools. This is why we need to cover that distance within two seconds to remain out of harm’s way. Then, linked defensive soul tools will be useless against us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke until here, Huo Yuhao paused for a moment before he continued, saying, “However, there’s still a problem – our uncertainty of our enemy’s strength. I scanned everything inside earlier, although it was at the price of alarming the enemy. When I scanned the place, I sensed that there were roughly a hundred and fifty soul engineers in the soul formation. However, I couldn’t tell their exact strength, as I was too rushed. This also means that the problem that we’ll face after sneaking in is how to quickly occupy the soul formation and get rid of the enemies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “This shouldn’t be a huge problem. Given our abilities, we should be able to fight even a Titled Douluo. Although Eastern City is an important fort, I don’t think the Sun Moon Empire will deploy many Titled Douluo here. Now that the war is in full scale, Titled Douluo are very important on the battlefield, as they can threaten their enemies on a strategic scale. However, they would be less useful if they were over here. On the other hand, I think covering five hundred meters is a more difficult task. Can the two of you do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “If our flying-type soul tools are at full speed, there shouldn’t be a problem. If we bring two people each with us, we should be able to scrape through.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi said, “That’s easy. Leave Caitou outside to liaise with us, while we charge in and quickly deal with the soul engineers. After that, we’ll occupy the soul formation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou was a little dissatisfied as he asked, “Why am I the one staying outside? My Fort Soul Engineer Legion isn’t participating in the fight either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi said, “Of course you are the one staying outside. After we enter, we must do our best not to cause any destruction to the soul formation. Rather, we must only lay our hands on the soul engineers. Those soul tools are extremely destructive. If we damage them, I’ll see how sad you’ll be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou twisted his lips and said, “That sounds logical. Alright then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei looked at Huo Yuhao and asked, “Yuhao, do you have anything to add?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “This time, our main force will be the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion. They’re the most flexible. Second senior shall commandeer them from the outside, and they’ll be prepared to liaise with us at any time. If something happens to us, second senior will lead the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion to focus its firepower and destroy the linked defense of the soul formation. Given the strength of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion, they should be able to do so within fifteen minutes. However, we must try to avoid a situation where the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion faces the offensive soul tools of the soul formation. People are more important than resources. We must not conserve any resources at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I know.” He Caitou nodded seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan said, “Yuhao, should we deploy our other two soul engineer legions outside the city just in case? If we face any problems, the other two soul engineer legions can coordinate with the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion to attack.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “There are many aerial surveillance soul tools above Eastern Sun City. It’ll be difficult to deploy the other two soul engineer legions. If the three soul engineer legions attack together, they’ll indeed be very destructive. But the problem is that we’ll be directly subjected to our own firepower once the enemy’s linked defense is overcome, as we will be within the soul formation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan realized how immature her proposition was after listening to his explanation. She turned slightly red and said, “Apologies, I didn’t consider everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi always didn’t stand on the side of reason. He hugged Jiang Nannan and cheerfully said, “No worries, no worries. You had a point too.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao followed by saying, “However, I’ll still need to adjust our manpower. If it’s the six of us that are going to charge in, I don’t think that’s the ideal combination.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Yuhao, you don’t need to have any misgivings. You are the chief commander of this mission. Everyone will listen to you. Your word is final.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Our main goal this time is to kill people, or at least make those soul engineers lose their fighting strength. Under such a circumstance, our attack is of paramount importance. For safety purposes, we need to be defensively sound too. That’s why I suggest that third senior has to go in. However, apart from him, we need to send our most offensive fighters in too. That’s why fourth senior and Xiao Xiao should stay out. Eldest senior, third senior, Wutong, Brother Ji, Ye Guyi and I shall be the six entering. In that way, we can achieve the greatest effect. Our combined destructiveness is the strongest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Xiao twisted her lips and said, “You’re not bringing me along for the fun again. Alright, I’ll stay outside with Caitou then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan nodded and said, “I’m fine with this arrangement too. I’ll help Caitou prepare the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “We’ll start then. Seniors, I’ll invite you guys out when I find a good spot. Get the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion to be fully equipped and ready to await orders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone nodded and quickly returned to the spectral demiplane through the door. Only Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong remained outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After shutting the door, Huo Yuhao led Tang Wutong out of the inn and proceeded towards the north.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thirty thousand soldiers didn’t scare them at all. Ordinary soldiers were just cannon fodder in front of soul engineers. Even if there were a few soul masters, they wouldn’t be able to cause much trouble either. This was why Huo Yuhao’s goal, to destroy the soul formation in Eastern Sun City first, was very precise. From there, they could control the entire city in the shortest time possible, and proceed with their strategic deployment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since they were going to attack, they definitely couldn’t do it from the inn they were staying in. Huo Yuhao and the few others could use his Imitation to conceal themselves. However, if the entire Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion was to move out, they needed to gather and prepare first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although aerial surveillance soul tools had great surveillance abilities, they weren’t effective against concealed things or people. They weren’t omnipotent. After all, the Sun Moon Empire couldn’t possibly use thermal detectors and oscillation detectors to scan the city continuously. There were many people living in the city. Such surveillance was completely unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Where was the best place for people to gather? There were two hundred people. Huo Yuhao had a clear idea of what to do, which was to gather everyone in the inn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, the northern city walls of Eastern Sun City were visible. Huo Yuhao squinted, and revealed a mysterious look in his eyes. The soul formation was not far in front of them anymore. This soul formation was very intricately constructed. It relied on the northern city walls. Some of the soul tools were located inside the city, while the others were on top of the city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as his Spiritual Detection was discovered earlier, Huo Yuhao couldn’t completely ascertain what those soul tools were. This was why he was very prudent when it came to this fight. He had to fight with his greatest strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from Ye Guyi, those who were involved in this mission had at least eight rings. Tang Wutong even had nine rings. Such power was already extraordinary. Moreover, Huo Yuhao’s combination with Tang Wutong made them as strong as a Transcendent Douluo. If nothing unexpected happened, it shouldn’t be difficult to charge in and take control of the soul formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spiritual Detection once again. Under his control, he avoided the soul formation, which was directly in front of him. Instead, he extended his Spiritual Detection to either side of the soul formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, he found the place that he was looking for. It was a hotel that was not far from the northern city walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This hotel wasn’t considered very huge. It only had three stories. The infrastructure also appeared rather decent, just that it looked slightly dilapidated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao discovered it, he immediately used his Spiritual Detection to scan it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The occupancy of this hotel wasn’t very high. It was only thirty percent full. The third floor was very quiet and empty. The guests in this hotel were also ordinary people. No sign of soul power undulations could be detected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This discovery left Huo Yuhao very satisfied. He had successfully found a place to hide the members of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used his Imitation and disappeared into the night with Tang Wutong. After a brief moment, they appeared within the hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time was not on his side. Huo Yuhao naturally didn’t ask for rooms. Not only would that leave traces behind, but it was also a massive waste of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gentle yet powerful spiritual power silently engulfed the entire building. In the next moment, his eyes flashed with golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A weaker version of his Spiritual Blast was unleashed. Whether it was the staff or the guests in the hotel, they immediately felt dizzy. In the next moment, they all passed out, and the entire hotel instantly went silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was how terrifying a spiritual-type soul master could be. Huo Yuhao managed to quietly gain control of the entire hotel. This time, he didn’t open too many of the spectral doors. He only opened three. The members of the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion streamed out of the doors and started to rapidly occupy the entire hotel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Huo Yuhao’s orders, all the guests in the hotel were gathered in the lobby and supervised.
