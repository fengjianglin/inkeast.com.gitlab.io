 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beast God, why are you venting your rage on others? Come at me if I am the one you’re looking for. Huo Yuhao will be here waiting for you.” A bright voice suddenly rang in the sky without any warning. Even though this voice did not appear to be particularly loud, the entire battlefield, including the Sun Moon Empire’s troops, which were camped fifty kilometers away from Shrek City, could hear his words clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The same words entered everyone’s ears, but different people reacted to this differently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan’s eyes suddenly lit up just when he was starting to lose hope. He immediately doused the flames on his body, which were burning his soul power, as the Taotie behind his back vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After regaining his Godly Taotie Bull martial soul, he was no longer that affected by Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was the same name, it induced a different emotion within Ju Zi. Now she knew that Di Tian had intruded into Shrek City to find Huo Yuhao. This also confirmed her suspicion that Huo Yuhao was really in Shrek City. At this instant, she was overwhelmed by several emotions as her mind turned completely blank after hearing Huo Yuhao’s voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A jade green light flashed as a figure soared up into the sky from within Shrek City. In the blink of an eye, the jade green figure was able to reach an incredibly high altitude. The powerful pressure released by Di Tian’s body did not seem to work on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The image flickered as the jade green light stopped next to Elder Xuan. This person was none other than Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was now wearing the Icy War God’s Armor. However, his body was radiating a jade blue glow underneath the armor. Elder Xuan could immediately sense the reduction in the surrounding pressure the moment Huo Yuhao moved closer to him. The pressure acting on him was essentially halved by his presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was surprised to see Huo Yuhao next to him. He whispered, “Did you succeed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan laughed and said, “That’s great! That’s great! Di Tian, weren’t you looking for Yuhao? Yuhao is now here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s expression changed as he stared at Huo Yuhao. He was startled to find himself no longer able to see through the young man before him. He could not tell what cultivation Huo Yuhao had attained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Di Tian, how have you been? I have something I want to return to you. I want to thank you for protecting me for all these years.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao’s wrist shook as a grey light surged towards Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian waved his right hand in the air as his aura weakened a little bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not need to see what he had caught to know what exactly was in his palm. It was the Black Dragon's reverse scale which he had given to Huo Yuhao previously to seal and monitor him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was actually able to remove the reverse scale from his body? This means that his power must have reached the heights of mine momentarily to even be able to remove my scale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimate Douluo? No, that’s impossible. He was still a Soul Douluo who was unable to attain the Titled Douluo rank not too long ago! How could he become an Ultimate Douluo in such a short amount of time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The same questions formed in Ju Zi’s mind as she watched from afar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had already known how powerful Huo Yuhao had become the last time she saw him at the palace in Radiant City. However, he was definitely not this strong! When did he develop the ability to stand unfazed before a battle between an Ultimate Douluo and the strongest individual in the world? It seemed like the Beast God had also become a little nervous after he had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a calm expression on Huo Yuhao’s face as he stared at the Beast God and expressed his respects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You actually managed to break free from my reverse scale. If I do not guess wrongly, there can only be one explanation.” The Beast God was able to speak calmly after recovering from his momentary shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted the visor on his armor as he flashed a smile. “Beast God, do you dare to fight me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, everyone, including the people from Shrek Academy and the Sun Moon Empire, was shocked beyond belief. There were many people who knew Huo Yuhao, and they could not believe their ears when they heard him challenging the Beast God—the strongest individual in the world—to a fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How old is he? How much power does he actually possess? What is he banking on to beat the Beast God? Isn’t he just seeking his own death?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What surprised them even more was how the Beast God actually nodded in approval. Di Tian pointed his Dark Dragon Sword at Huo Yuhao and said, “Sure. Let me see what you have learned and understood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s pupils lit up after hearing Di Tian’s response. One of his pupils was completely golden, while the other one radiated a jade blue glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, he was brimming with confidence. Even he himself did not know how strong he had become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he had succeeded. With the help of his companions and Elder Mu, he had finally succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ice Spirit Fusion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boooommm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Snow Empress’ intent entered Huo Yuhao’s heart, he felt as if he was blown into a million pieces by the insane amount of energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, he was completely unable to sense his own soul cores and body. Everything seemed to have turned blank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sensation lasted for an unknown amount of time before he slowly regained his senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An extremely familiar energy was enveloping his spiritual soul core, which had many tiny cracks around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the presence of this energy that prevented it from shattering. Right now, his spiritual soul core was repairing itself at an insane rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waves of mystical energy were being released constantly from his body. When Huo Yuhao took a closer look at his body, he realized that it had completely transformed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crystal clear white soul core was rotating quietly at his chest. Its size was slightly bigger than the spiritual soul core. There seemed to be a human figure flickering within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was able to recognize the figure in his soul core instantly. The figure was none other than the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s torso bone was no longer glowing. At this instant, his bones had turned a brilliant golden color after being nourished by the Dragon Pill. The Ice Empress’ aura had become so weak that he could barely sense it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had no idea what had happened. But at this instant, he realized he was no longer able to communicate with the Snow Empress, the Ice Empress, Little Bai, and the rest. Even Li Ya had fallen into a deep slumber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Skydream!” Huo Yuhao was finally, fully awake. He recognized the mystical energy which was encircling his spiritual soul core. It belonged to the Skydream Iceworm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s exclamation seemed to have awakened the Skydream Iceworm. However, Skydream did not seem to be able to respond. The mystical energy simply disappeared as the Skydream Iceworm transformed into a streak of light which vanished in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, he had lost all contact with his six Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally had two soul cores. His spiritual soul core was bright golden, while the Ultimate Ice soul core at his chest was white. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two soul cores were now rotating in opposite directions. The energy they were releasing was fusing at a point that lay between them. That point was where all of Huo Yuhao’s power began. Tiny spirals, which were formed after the power released by the two soul cores had collided, flowed into the passageways within his body. This pure compressed soul power and spiritual power was healing Huo Yuhao’s broken body at an incredible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Life Guardian Sword was also naturally nourishing Huo Yuhao’s body with the dense life energy it was radiating. It was almost as if Huo Yuhao was getting a brand new body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The memory flashed across his mind for an instant before vanishing. To be honest, even Huo Yuhao did not know how he had managed to succeed. His six Spirits were now all asleep, and were unable to answer any of his queries. He just knew that he had somehow managed to succeed. He believed that his six Spirits must have paid a hefty price to assist him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his body had completely recovered, he noticed the Black Dragon’s reverse scale on the floor. Immediately, he sensed that the Beast God was high up in the sky above him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he left the room and came to where they were to face the Beast God. And at this moment, he did not fear Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s figure flickered, and disappeared from Elder Xuan’s side. When his body flickered again, he was already a few kilometers away from the parameters of Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian let out a cold grunt as he took a huge stride in the air and appeared in front of Huo Yuhao. As he lifted the Dark Dragon Sword in his hand, the sky started to darken. It was as if the entire intent of heaven and earth was in his control as he smashed the power of the natural elements into Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pressed the visor down onto his face as the Icy War God’s Armor released a bright jade blue glow. Following which, a short dagger appeared in his hand. Huo Yuhao immediately raised his arm as a four foot-long blue light appeared on the blade of the dagger. In addition, there seemed to be a layer of thin mist surrounding the blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding air seemed to come to a standstill as extreme cold permeated throughout the air. Even the Sun Moon Empire soldiers, which were a long way from the battle could sense the plunge in temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Di Tian’s pupils suddenly contracted as the Dark Dragon’s Sword in his hand went straight for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purple-black sword light ripped apart the space between them and left a gaping hole as it went straight for Huo Yuhao’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword not only contained the power of darkness, but also spatial power. The Beast God’s power lay in how he was able to combine and fuse both his dark-type and spatial powers. At this instant, for unknown reasons, the power he had borrowed from the Great Star Dou Forest had started to recede like the tide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao did not try to avoid the sword as he waved the dagger in his hand to block the sword light coming from Di Tian. This was a power which even Elder Xuan could not block directly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A gasp of surprise could be heard from behind Elder Xuan. Yan Shaozhe, Xian Lin’er and the rest had arrived by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had all been stupefied when they heard Huo Yuhao challenge Di Tian. They could not understand what Huo Yuhao was trying to do.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Can he challenge the Beast God with the power he possesses?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clinggg!” A bright metallic sound echoed from high up in the sky. An unexpected sight unfolded before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
