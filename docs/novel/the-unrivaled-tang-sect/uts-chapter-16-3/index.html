 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 16.3: Freshman Examination</strong></p>
 <p>With his current cultivation speed, Huo Yuhao was confident that he could break into the twentieth rank by the time he graduated as a first-year student, thereby obtaining a second soul ring. According to his brother Skydream, his strength would rapidly soar when he obtained his second soul ring, especially when his ice-type martial soul truly had its own abilities.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao looked forward to that moment very much. When that happened, he’d definitely be able to help Wang Dong a lot more when they fought side-by-side.</p>
 <p>Time always passed extremely the fastest during meditation; evening soon arrived. Like yesterday, Huo Yuhao walked over to the canteen to clean his fish before he headed towards the academy’s entrance.</p>
 <p>The flow of people at the academy’s entrance had clearly been reduced. Perhaps it was due to the upcoming freshman assessment, but a majority of the freshmen felt a sense of urgency, causing them to bitterly cultivate inside of their dorm rooms.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao’s business wasn’t affected by this at all. When he arrived, a queue had already formed, with the person in front being, amazingly, Xu Sanshi.</p>
 <p>“Ding—” Xu Sanshi handed Huo Yuhao a silver soul coin and said, “No need to hand me any change; just make sure to give me a big fish.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao chuckled and replied, “Big brother Xu, nothing can stop you, can it?”</p>
 <p>The previous rift between the two had already closed. After beginning to see each other every day, they’d long become familiar with each other. After he became familiar with Xu Sanshi, Huo Yuhao discovered that, even though he wasn’t as gentle as Bei Bei, and even though he had a bit of a violent temper and a fiery disposition, he was still extremely sincere with his friendships.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi laughed mischievously. “Who was the one that made me like what you roast? If I don’t at least get a bite of this every night, my dinner won’t taste delicious at all. I’ve eaten many roasted fish in the past, but not a single person was able to control the fire as well as you do. Even Jiang Nannan has praised your roasting technique. Right, I’ve heard that the freshman assessment’s about to start?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded his head a few times and replied, “Yeah!”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi said, “Then you have to work hard. You can’t get eliminated! If you do, I won’t be able to eat anymore roasted fish.” Even now, he still didn’t know that Huo Yuhao had been behind Bei Bei’s victory during their match. He only knew that Huo Yuhao’s talent was ordinary, but that he could roast fish extremely well. Actually, Huo Yuhao’s fame in Shrek Academy for his roasted fish was definitely greater than fame for his strength.</p>
 <p>“Little Xu.” At this moment, a crisp voice suddenly rang out. When Xu Sanshi heard this voice, he immediately began to shiver. Huo Yuhao even saw a few hints of fear, but even more than that, helplessness, appear within his eyes.</p>
 <p>The other diners that had queued up behind Xu Sanshi instantly quieted down.</p>
 <p>A girl walked out from the academy’s entrance with slow steps, causing the crowd to open up a path for her in a very natural manner, so much so that they didn’t even dane to look at her; they all lowered their heads as she passed. Her appearance clearly exceeded that of Jiang Nannan’s appearance last time.</p>
 <p>When Huo Yuhao raised his head to see who the girl was, he discovered that the newcomer was a red-clothed woman. Her body was slender and well-proportioned, with the first thing that most people would notice when looking at her being her slightly exaggerated peaks that were firm, towering, and lustful...</p>
 <p>Her waist was extremely slim, with that slimness continuing all the way down to her thighs, where it suddenly arced out. Her legs were perfectly straight and round, while at the same time a strong aura of youthfulness that was emanated by her assaulted one’s senses.</p>
 <p>However, her facial features couldn’t clearly be seen; she wore a red veil over her face. However, one could tell that she was definitely a beauty from just her eyes alone. Her faintly-pink eyes could easily make one feel as if his soul had been swept away. Fortunately, her gaze was extremely cold, which slightly suppressed the glow of rapture in her eyes that was capable of penetrating into one’s bones.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi clearly seemed to recognise her. After summoning up some courage, he turned around. However, he didn’t look directly into her eyes; he lowered his head slightly instead, and replied, “Sister Xiaotao.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Huo Yuhao was even more astonished. Xu Sanshi was an untameable person with quite a fiery disposition, who had an even higher status than Bei Bei in the outer courtyard due to him being a fifth year student. Because of his great talent, many sixth year students were somewhat reverent of him; even teachers wouldn’t cause him to act like this! Just who was this red-clothed girl? After looking at the girl closely, both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong felt as if she looked slightly familiar for some reason.</p>
 <p>The red-clothed girl looked over at Huo Yuhao’s oven, then slowly walked up to Xu Sanshi and said, “Little Xu, you’ve come to eat roasted fish?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi nodded his head and said, “Yeah! Huo Yuhao’s roasted fish tastes extraordinary. It’s really tasty.”</p>
 <p>A slight trace of curiosity appeared on the red-clothed girl’s eyes, and she said to Huo Yuhao, “Let me try one.” She wasn’t the type of fairy that wouldn’t eat the food of ‘common mortals’. Practically all of her days were spent cultivating, so she was naturally excited when she found something new.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao subconsciously replied, “I’m sorry, I only sell thirty fish a day. Thirty people have already queued up today, so please come earlier on tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>These exact words had been uttered by him countless times before. However, when his voice rang out this time, practically everyone standing in the queue simultaneously raised their heads to look at him with terrified expressions; even Xu Sanshi wasn’t an exception.</p>
 <p>Following that, the people who’d been queued behind Xu Sanshi loudly dispersed and walked away as fast as they could, causing Huo Yuhao to become even more astonished.</p>
 <p>The red-clothed girl smiled and said, “Okay, there’s no one left in the queue now. I think that I should be able to eat one now, right?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi continuously made a few gestures to Huo Yuhao with his eyes. Huo Yuhao wasn’t someone who didn’t understand how things worked. After nodding his head, he continued to roast his fish seriously.</p>
 <p>However, Wang Dong who was at his side was somewhat indignant. “Who are you? Why did you disturb our business?”</p>
 <p>The red-clothed girl raised her right hand, exposing her tender hand. On it, there was a large blood-like crimson ruby that was absolutely beautiful. The ruby flashed, causing a single gold soul coin to appear in her hand. She then passed it to Wang Dong and said, “I’ll take all of today’s roasted fish.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong wasn’t polite at all as he took the gold soul coin. Afterwards, he didn’t utter another word. Although this red-clothed girl was threatening to the point of scaring so many people away, she didn’t look unreasonable. Furthermore, he felt that something was wrong; a few traces of fear towards this red-clothed girl had actually appeared in his heart.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao honestly replied, “I don’t need this much money. My roasted fish only cost five copper soul coins apiece.”</p>
 <p>The red-clothed girl seemed as if she wasn’t willing to talk with him anymore. She indifferently said, “Just take it as a deposit. Just don’t ask me for money if I want to eat here in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Huo Yuhao nodded and replied whilst simultaneously continuing to carefully roast fish.</p>
 <p>The red-clothed girl originally looked as if she’d come to find Xu Sanshi, but she didn’t even seem to care about Xu Sanshi now. Instead, she was now focusing on Huo Yuhao as he roasted fish.</p>
 <p>After a short period of time, she let out a soft cry of surprise. “Your fire-controlling technique is this perfect?! Do you have a fire-type martial soul?” She herself was an expert in the field of fire, so she was naturally able to see that Huo Yuhao’s fire-control while he was roasting the fish had reached the apex of precision.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao simply shook his head.</p>
 <p>After a short period of time, he finished roasting the first four fish. Since nobody else was coming today, Huo Yuhao simply passed two to the red-clothed girl and two to Xu Sanshi. In reality, he didn’t just buy thirty mackerels everyday; any extra fish were naturally left to Tang Ya and Wang Dong.</p>
