 <p><strong>Book 4: The Golden Road</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 23.1: The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence</strong></p>
 <p>On the one hand, you had the golden-eyed Huo Yuhao;</p>
 <p>On the other hand, you had the dazzling winged Wang Dong, who’d released his Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>In the instant that they released their martial souls, everything within ten meters of them lit up. An extraordinary light suddenly blossomed outwards from their bodies.</p>
 <p>That light was very peculiar; it was a bizarre light that alternated between the colors blue, purple, and gold. Its core consisted of a dense aura of light, and it was even fused together with a few different mysterious soul power undulations.</p>
 <p>An enormous shadow appeared behind Wang Dong’s back. It was a complete and magnificent Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, an enormous eye with a vertical pupil appeared behind Huo Yuhao. This eye was light-gold in color, but its pupil was faintly purple.</p>
 <p>After blanking out for a brief moment, the two of them came back to their senses. However, they immediately noticed that everything around them was filled with an intense light.</p>
 <p>The two enormous shadows slowly approached each other in midair; as they approached each other, they began to transform. The color of the eye that represented Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eye gradually turned deeper, and its entire body turned bluish-purple. However, its golden component had vanished completely.</p>
 <p>The shadow that represented Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess started to violently combust as it neared Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eye; it burned with a bluish-golden flame.</p>
 <p>In the end, after crossing what seemed to be an entire world, the two martial soul shadows finally touched each other above Huo Yuhao’s and Wang Dong’s heads.</p>
 <p>In that instant, their bodies simultaneously shook violently. The Haodong Power that had formed as a result of their fusion erupted like a geyser, draining all of their energy in what seemed to be an instant.</p>
 <p>The flaming Radiant Butterfly Goddess spread its dazzling wings, slowly hugging the shadow of Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eye. In that instant, the shadow of the Radiant Butterfly Goddess disappeared, but the bluish-purple Spirit Eye continued to release a stream of light.</p>
 <p>The dazzling bluish-golden flame erupted from the shadow of the Spirit Eye, which slowly descended to protect the two of them.</p>
 <p>The enormous Spirit Eye seemed extremely arcane. If one were to look carefully, it would seem as though there was a boundless world contained within it. In an instant, a tri-colored beam of blue, purple, and gold shot out.</p>
 <p>This illusion-like ray of light shot forth in a straight line, and everything in its path turned into nothingness. The resplendence contained within that single instant seemed to last forever. The halos of light created wherever the tri-colored beam of light passed didn’t disperse; instead, it left a blurry and distorted brilliance in its wake.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong weren’t able to witness this scene. In the instant that ray of light was released, the Haodong Power within their bodies was instantly drained. The intense feeling of weakness that resulted from this instantly caused them to collapse and faint...</p>
 <p>Martial soul fusion skills were always skills that released an extremely large amount of power. This was also their first time trying it out, so they had to undergo the process of two martial souls fusing. Thus, the drain on their soul power and mental energies was extremely large. Furthermore, they had never adapted to a situation like this in the past, so it was no wonder they fainted.</p>
 <p>They directly collapsed onto the ground, even though they were still hugging each other...</p>
 <p>A speechless night passed...</p>
 <p>Daytime gradually arrived...</p>
 <p>He didn’t know whether he’d fainted or fallen asleep, but when Wang Dong woke up, he truly felt like dying.</p>
 <p>It was fortunate that they had been on Wang Dong’s bed last night. But today, the two of them were still tightly hugging each other, but they were covered in dust, dirt, and dew. They had directly fallen asleep in the forest. Was this the fabled one night stand?</p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao, get up right now!” As Wang Dong struggled to climb out of Huo Yuhao’s embrace, his expression turned somewhat hysterical.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao drowsily opened his eyes. After discovering that the sun was already up, he was startled and quickly got up. However, the next thing he saw was Wang Dong, who was standing over him and looked as if he were about to beat him up violently.</p>
 <p>Clenching his teeth, Wang Dong glared at him. “Didn’t you say that we wouldn’t fall asleep while hugging each other?”</p>
 <p>“Did, did I say that?” Huo Yuhao replied blankly.</p>
 <p>“You… I’m gonna beat you up.” Wang Dong suddenly pounced, straddling Huo Yuhao. He then started to rain blows down on him.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hurriedly caught his hands and looked to the side with a blank look in his eyes, “L-look…”</p>
 <p>“What am I supposed to look at…” Once he spoke, Wang Dong subconsciously glanced toward the direction where Huo Yuhao was looking; he couldn’t remain calm after seeing what Huo Yuhao saw.</p>
 <p>To their astonishment, a mysterious trench had appeared in a direction forty-five degrees away from them.</p>
 <p>This trench was roughly 1.5 metres wide, 30 centimetres deep, and stretched 50 or so meters in a straight line into the distance before quietly disappearing.</p>
 <p>If it were just an ordinary trench, the two of them absolutely wouldn’t be this surprised. After all, the fusion skill they had unleashed had completely drained them of their soul power and knocked them out for an entire night. Thus, it was normal for it to be this strong.</p>
 <p>However, the most terrifying thing about it was the fact that a layer of light-gold had covered the soil in the trench; this light-gold was actually identical to the light-gold that appeared whenever Huo Yuhao activated his Spirit Eyes.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just the soil. Because there were a few trees in the path of the trench, a semicircular hole had appeared on a tree which was at the edge of the trench. Furthermore, the inside of that hole was covered in a layer of light-gold as well. In addition to that, every plant near both sides of the trench was covered in a layer of light-gold as well.</p>
 <p>At this very moment under the sun’s radiance, that dazzling layer of light-gold looked like a golden road that had appeared in front of Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. How could they not be astonished?</p>
 <p>“This, was this created by your Radiant Butterfly Goddess?” Huo Yuhao asked blankly.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was currently still atop Huo Yuhao’s body. He subconsciously shook his head. “No, absolutely not. Although my martial soul’s gold, it's either bright gold or bluish-golden. It’d never be a light-gold color like this. This, this looks identical to the color of your Spirit Eyes!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao slapped his thigh and said, “Quickly, get up. Let’s go and take a look.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” At this moment, Wang Dong was fascinated by the golden road; he didn’t notice that the area Huo Yuhao had slapped was near his buttocks. After getting up, Huo Yuhao hurriedly got up as well, and the two of them quickly walked over to the golden road before squatting down to take a look.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was just about to touch the golden road, but Huo Yuhao grabbed his hand. “You said that this is just like the color of my Spirit Eyes, so I should do this.” As he spoke, he stretched his hand into the trench and touched its golden surface.</p>
