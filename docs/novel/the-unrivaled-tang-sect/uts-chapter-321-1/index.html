It looked like Chen Lu was about to break out from the ice...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression turned serious, and he swiped his right hand. The complete version of the Darkgolden Terrorclaws was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could compare to him in terms of capturing the perfect timing. Just as the dark golden lights from his terrorclaws arrived, the ice broke apart, and Chen Lu escaped. Chen Lu was instantly greeted with the extremely sharp blades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lu had no other choice; his fifth soul ring lit up. He used his fifth soul skill once again, the Three-Legged Dragontoad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had obtained this soul skill after hunting and killing a ten-thousand year Three-Legged Dragontoad. When he used this soul skill, he could create another leg for his body soul. As he released a light barrier from his Three-Legged Dragontoad, he could protect himself and greatly increase his fighting strength. Among the same-generation disciples of the Body Sect, his fifth soul ring was the best among all the soul rings at the same level. He was recognized to have the strongest fifth soul ring in the entire Body Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gaining five rings and attaining this ability before he was eighteen years old was why he could represent the Body Sect in this tournament. At the same time, he was being nurtured as one of the future elites of the sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lu, who wanted to get up, and slammed was smacked back to the ground. Although his Three-Legged Dragontoad blocked the attack of the Darkgolden Terrorclaws, the terrorclaws were still the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s greatest ability. It was extremely destructive, and wasn’t inferior to Huo Yuhao’s strongest version of the Unparalleled Chill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five enormous cracks appeared on the barrier, and the effect of the ten-thousand year soul skill was instantly destroyed. Chen Lu was so devastated that he almost spat blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had no intention of letting him off. He retracted his Terrorclaws and clenched his fist. A bright-golden light extended from his body. Following this, he punched out at Chen Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sovereign’s Descent! This was the Sovereign’s Descent formed after Huo Yuhao fused his spiritual power and various abilities together. He had already evolved the Dragon God Douluo’s skill into his own version.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lu cursed in his heart, and a layer of golden light was released from his body. He had already used his Three-Legged Dragontoad twice, and it wasn’t feasible for him to use it a third time. As his soul power rapidly dipped, he had no choice but to activate his own Invincible Barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ripples formed on the barrier as the blow slammed against it, but it gave Chen Lu an opportunity to catch his breath. He quickly channeled power into his legs and sprang up from the depression he was in. With how strong his legs were, he immediately flew high into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lu was clearly aware of his greatest strength, which was his speed. However, he had been completely suppressed by Huo Yuhao during their confrontations. His speed advantage couldn’t be realized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After using his fifth soul skill twice and initiating the Second Awakening of his body soul, he had already used up more power than Wang Yanfeng had earlier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time wasn’t on his side!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lu hated Huo Yuhao a lot right now. It was his first fight in the entire tournament! His teammates and Princess Wei Na were watching him! How could he lose to a cripple?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He flipped around in the air, and his energy flow smoothed out. Although he was affected by the chill from the Ultimate Ice, he managed to repress this chill using his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a deep breath, and seemed to grow larger. His legs expanded, and the greenish-bronze projection flashed behind his back again. This time, Chen Lu had completely locked onto Huo Yuhao. Having jumped high into the air, he came swiftly crashing back down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t differentiate between Huo Yuhao’s illusions, so he wanted to use his speed so that Huo Yuhao didn’t have any opportunity to use his illusory tricks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Huo Yuhao couldn’t dodge the incessant attacks anymore. He looked up at his opponent in the sky and raised his right arm to block his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A ring of distorted ripples was released from an ordinary-looking ring on one of his right-hand fingers. This ring of ripples changed into a gentle, milky-white shield that protected him. Subtle golden patterns appeared on the shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to prevent himself from being displaced, Chen Lu came down with only his physical body. His legs, which were now more than two meters long, appeared deformed. It was as if two bronze pillars were descending from the sky and crashing down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two bronze pillars struck Huo Yuhao’s shield, there was a massive boom as a ball of greenish-bronze light surged and blew apart, with Huo Yuhao at the center of the explosion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It felt as if a huge hammer had fallen from the sky and pounded the stage. The surrounding floor collapsed, and a terrifying destructive force caused countless fissures to extend across the stage floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A figure shot back into the sky, and a bronze light started to undulate tremendously. As his screams echoed out, the figure that shot into the sky spat out fresh blood. As the bronze light dispersed, it became clear that the figure belonged to Chen Lu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tremendous explosion caused debris to fly everywhere. As Chen Lu was driven back, Huo Yuhao’s figure also became clear amid the debris. Rings of white surrounded his body and made it seem as if he were in a fairy tale. Layers and layers of glowing light undulated around his shield, as if they were shaking. Beneath him, there was an area one and a half meters in diameter that hadn’t collapsed at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He managed to block Chen Lu’s all-out attack?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chen Lu crashed down. When he landed on the ground, his calves had already returned to normal. However, he fell on his butt and grabbed his legs with both his hands while screaming in pain. Right now, it was very clear that his calves were in very unnatural shapes. Evidently, he was gravely injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shut his eyes and sensed the surging life aura in his body. Through his spiritual force, he asked in some concern, “Brother Skydream, how are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had used the Life Reflecting Shield to resist Chen Lu’s attack. It was the strength the Skydream Iceworm had conferred onto Huo Yuhao after he turned into a spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the Skydream Iceworm didn’t have four orange-gold soul rings like the Snow Empress, he was still a million-year soul beast! Although his blood couldn’t compare to the Snow Empress, he was still the only soul beast in the continent to reach a million-year cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greatest strength of the Life Reflecting Shield was that it could reflect an attack after absorbing the impact of an attack. Once the attack was reflected onto the opponent, the harm that was inflicted on the opponent would be equivalent to the strength fed to Skydream Iceworm’s body to restore the defensive strength of the shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the close-combat that had just occurred, Chen Lu’s all-out attack on the Life Reflecting Shield was fed back into his calves. How could he not be seriously injured?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Skydream Iceworm didn’t have it easy against this attack either. He had indeed absorbed a huge amount of life power to replenish his own body, but he had also absorbed the entire impact of the attack, as he didn’t have Huo Yuhao’s soul power to support him. As a result, he bore the entire attack, which was stronger than an attack from a seven-ringed Soul Sage using his Martial Soul True Body, all on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m fine. The life power is very concentrated. However, I’ll need some time to absorb it. At least, within fifteen minutes, I’m unable to help you resist an attack of such a level again. Deal with it yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing the Skydream Iceworm’s words, Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief. He couldn’t use his own soul power to increase the defensive strength of the Life Reflecting Shield. However, he had to conserve his energy in the individual elimination round! He could only exploit the Skydream Iceworm’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Chen Lu’s cultivation, it was impossible for him to truly damage the Life Reflecting Shield. The Skydream Iceworm only needing fifteen minutes to recover was already beyond Huo Yuhao’s expectations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As lights shot out above his shoulders, Huo Yuhao was propelled over the depression. The Unbreakable Douluo was already in front of Chen Lu. After checking out his condition, he immediately gestured to signal the end of the fight.</span></p>

Wang Yanfeng jumped onto the stage and carried the critically injured Chen Lu down. After a brief inspection, he discovered that Chen Lu’s calves had broken into three parts. It wasn’t just an injury to his physical body; it was also an injury to his martial soul! He was highly unlikely to be able to compete in the team round.</span></p>

Although they were fractured, his passageways weren’t seriously hurt. After his teammates helped set his broken bones, he was in much less pain.</span></p>

Even if he couldn’t compete today, he could still recover within a week under her treatment, based on his control of his martial soul.</span></p>

However, what were they going to do in the following fights? Huo Yuhao had already won two fights. The Soul Emperors from the Tang Sect had yet to compete. If this continued, the Snowdemon Sect was going to be in an extremely disadvantageous situation.</span></p>

At this point, a cold-looking young man stood from the Snowdemon Sect stood up and said, “Let me go.”</span></p>

As her gaze met his, the young man nodded at her. His body flashed, and he was already up on the stage.</span></p>

However, he felt his hair rising when this young man from the Snowdemon Sect appeared on the stage. It gave him the same feeling as the time when the Skydream Iceworm met the Ice Empress in the Extreme North!</span></p>

Evidently this young man’s cultivation was quite high!</span></p>
