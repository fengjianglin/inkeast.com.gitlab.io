 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou turned around to look at him, and laughed. “What backstab? I would say the same even if you were in front of me! You have been too wild outside recently. We have been the ones dealing with so much of the sect’s internal affairs, and it’s your turn to stay back this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “I’m not very good at resolving the sect’s internal affairs! Eldest senior brother won’t rest assured giving me those responsibilities, right? I’m better at fighting instead. Furthermore, I’m the Tang Sect’s main control-type soul master, and if I’m not there, everyone’s strength will be greatly diminished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a little worried that Bei Bei wouldn’t let him go. Huo Yuhao’s individual fighting strength was one of the best within the Tang Sect. More importantly, he was the only true control-type soul master within the Tang Sect. Everyone’s overall fighting strength would be greatly boosted with him around. Furthermore, he had always been the one in command in battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded slightly and said, “It’s quite impossible to fight in the outside world without little junior brother. The truth is, I do want him to keep him here to deal with the sect’s internal affairs. Haih, we’ll do that after this operation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao glanced at He Caitou proudly, as He Caitou retorted dejectedly, “You can’t be biased, eldest senior brother! Don’t we have Dean Yan and Elder Song commanding the team this time? Little junior brother’s absence won’t mean much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately said virtuously, “You can’t say that, second senior brother! The Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools are developing very quickly, and I have been fighting against them consistently. I have a deep understanding of the Sun Moon Empire’s way of battle. Furthermore, the situation at the front lines is still a mystery, and we don’t know where teacher Xiao Ya is located. With my Spiritual Detection, searching for her will be a lot easier. Elder Xuan has already said we have to confuse our opponents as much as possible in this operation. Your fighting strength with soul tools is so formidable, second senior brother, so what if we expose our Academy’s soul tool standards to them? Won’t that undermine our complete plan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou was rendered speechless by Huo Yuhao’s words. The truth was that He Caitou staying behind was indeed the most appropriate this time. However, he hadn’t been outside for a long time, and was itching to do something. More importantly, Xiao Xiao was also participating in this expedition, and he was a little worried inside, as he wanted to protect her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I agree to let him stay behind,” a deep voice spoke up at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone turned towards where this voice came from; it was Xuan Ziwen, who was sitting just below Bei Bei’s position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone else’s words were probably not so effective, but Xuan Ziwen’s words immediately made He Caitou smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who was Xuan Ziwen? He was the master of the Tang Sect’s Soul Tool Hall, and he deserved much credit for the Tang Sect’s recent developments. He held a very high status within the Tang Sect, and everyone in the Tang Sect’s senior levels treated him with respect, like a teacher. He was Huo Yuhao’s teacher in the first place, and even Bei Bei had to respect his opinions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression immediately crumbled. “Teacher Xuan, you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen grunted and said “You still have the audacity to talk back to me? How long have you spent not studying soul tool construction? Don’t forget, you’re already a Class 7 soul engineer. Furthermore, I would not allow it even if you wanted to forgo your development as a soul engineer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Huo Yuhao stared at Xuan Ziwen in confusion. He remembered very clearly that he had made an agreement with teacher Xuan that they would focus on using all sorts of soul tools, and less on forging soul tools. They would focus more of their attention towards developing his abilities as a soul master. He had twin martial souls after all, and he was already a high-tier soul master at his current rank. His normal cultivation speed would be affected if he continued to train as both soul master and soul engineer at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, that was the reason Huo Yuhao had given back then when he was discussing it with Xuan Ziwen. The truth however, was that ever since he had obtained his spiritual soul core, and after he had absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, training as a soul engineer at the same time wouldn’t affect his cultivation speed much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen snickered and said, “You dug this hole for yourself, Yuhao. Do you remember those rare metals that you let Qiuqiu bring back here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you talking about the Divine Ice Crystals?” Huo Yuhao asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen nodded and said, “Yes, I’m talking about those Divine Ice Crystals. I have never seen that kind of rare metal before, and I began to inspect it once she brought it back. I used all sorts of methods to investigate this rare metal’s characteristics, and I have finally come to a conclusion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen stood up as he finished. He surveyed everyone in the Tang Sect before he lowered his voice and said, “The Divine Ice Crystal’s quality is comparable to any of the top-tier rare metals in the world today. Furthermore, it can only be equal or better. This means that the Divine Ice Crystals can be used to forge Class 9 soul tools, and it can even be used as materials for forging Class 10 soul tools. I’ve heard from Qiuqiu that you obtained quite a few of these things!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes! I have obtained quite a bit of them. Teacher Xuan, I’ll give it all to you. What do you think? After all, you can just forge a suitable soul tool for me when the time comes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen chuckled once more, his laughter evidently meaning something else as Huo Yuhao felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen continued, “Yes, the Divine Ice Crystal is very precious. However, you probably didn’t realize that I can’t craft things with the Divine Ice Crystals after inspecting them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Huo Yuhao stared at Xuan Ziwen in shock. “Why?” Teacher Xuan had officially become a Class 9 soul engineer. Even though he had just broken through to Class 9, that was only because Xuan Ziwen had been restricted by his own soul power. In terms of his knowledge regarding soul tools and forging them, he was one of the best across the entire continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What use were rare metals that not even Teacher Xuan could use to forge, no matter how precious they were?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen laughed coldly and said, “That’s because the Divine Ice Crystals will continuously release intense chills when used. This chilly air is at least one hundred degrees below zero, and at such temperatures, not even I can complete the job, even though I’m already a Titled Douluo. Both engraving formation arrays and crafting tools require the utmost concentration, and not a single mistake can be made. How can I craft soul tools under such circumstances? This means that the Divine Ice Crystals are very good stuff, but you are the only one who can forge them into soul tools. That’s because you are the only one with an Ultimate Ice martial soul, so you’re not afraid of the cold exuded from that rare metal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression froze, and only now did he understand what was meant by shooting himself in the foot. Wasn’t that right? Teacher Xuan’s words meant that he was probably the only one who could forge the Divine Ice Crystals into soul tools within the Tang Sect, and possibly within the entire Academy. Furthermore, such top-tier materials had to be used to forge top-tier soul tools, and that couldn’t be done without a lot of effort. He was still a Class 7 soul engineer in terms of forging soul tools. Teacher Xuan didn’t want him to leave, because he wanted Huo Yuhao to continue learning about forging soul tools from him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, since these Divine Ice Crystals will release very low temperatures during forging, will that affect its quality? If all the coldness within is released, it won’t have any value even if the forging is successful.” Huo Yuhao probed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen continued, “You don’t have to worry about that, because I finished conducting experiments a long time ago. I have called the Divine Ice Crystal a top-tier rare metal; how could I take it so seriously if I couldn’t even resolve a problem like that? Divine Ice Crystals will release very low temperatures when struck from the outside, or when soul power is infused into them, but once those actions stop, the low temperatures will recede. This means that its own energies will be contained, and it will maintain its original state. The constant change in its temperature means there’s nothing I can do to it. Otherwise, I would have already attempted to forge soul tools with the metal. What do you have left to say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao forced a laugh and said, “Can this wait until after I return?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Xuan Ziwen said decisively. “You have been hanging around outside for so long, and you haven’t been paying much attention to forging soul tools or working hard as a soul engineer. You will lose your skills if this continues. Don’t think you can do what you like just because you’re talented. You are still young, but your future will be limited if your heart isn’t in the right place. It’s time for you to focus and curb your distractions. Therefore, I am not allowing you to go this time. You’ll stay in the Tang Sect and deal with its internal affairs as you learn about crafting soul tools with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very wise, Teacher Xuan!” He Caitou boot-licked at an appropriate time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen glared at him and said, “Don’t even try. He can’t go, and you can’t go, either. Yuhao is correct; now is the time to keep a low profile and accumulate our strength. We cannot expose our strength at crafting soul tools to the Sun Moon Empire. Furthermore, your development in forging soul tools has reached the standard of a Class 8 soul engineer, so you’d better stay at the Academy to learn more. I predict that once your soul power breaks through Rank 80, you will become a Class 8 soul engineer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou pulled a long face and said, “It’s not as easy as it seems! I’m only at Rank 75, Teacher Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have to remain steady on your path,” Xuan Ziwen replied plainly. “Furthermore, I’ll be the only one left if you leave. Doesn’t that mean all the work is going to be piled onto me? You won’t be very useful even if you go, so you’d better stay here and do some work. You can go out and do whatever you want once our three soul engineer legions have been established. For now, you are going to do some hard labor for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I…” He Caitou dropped back into his seat. How could he dare displease Teacher Xuan? He was still hoping he’d guide him into becoming a Class 9 soul engineer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though He Caitou was a little low-spirited because he hadn’t been going out, his individual cultivation, and his prowess with and understanding of soul tools, had been improving exponentially over the past year. His strength was a far cry from what it was back in the day. Therefore, he didn’t dare to retort, even though he was depressed!</span></p>
