 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Furthermore, she was extremely focused this time. She knew that she had to lock Huo Yuhao down in order to defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While her idea was good, it was a pity that reality was cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her Starcrown was about to reach Huo Yuhao, but his figure suddenly turned illusory. His pace doubled, and he managed to escape Xu Yun’s lock on as he moved his body in some unknown way. At the same time, he leapt forward once again, and gestured towards Xu Yun, palm turned toward himself. Xu Yun suddenly felt a suction force pulling her towards her opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In such a critical moment, Xu Yun’s reaction was rather commendable. She grit her teeth and another of her Starbursts ignited.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aren’t you trying to pull me over? Alright, I shall deliver a Starburst to you, then.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was already prepared to perish alongside Huo Yuhao. In fact, her Starcrown could assimilate some of the abilities that she unleashed. This meant that Huo Yuhao was bound to face a greater explosive force if her Starburst blew apart, and they were standing the same distance away from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao revealed a slight smile on his face. His right palm suddenly shook a few times before Xu Yun’s Starburst started to shake, too. Once again, it broke free from Xu Yun’s control, and Huo Yuhao flung it into the air. Huo Yuhao kicked at her as she exclaimed in shock. He hit the same spot he had yesterday.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t even bother with being gentlemanly. With one kick, Xu Yun flew away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was so quick that Dai Luoli couldn’t make it in time to save her even if he wanted to. He watched helplessly as Xu Yun flew through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he leapt up, Dai Luoli immediately charged to Xu Yun’s side, “Yun’er, no. Yun’er, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She felt an excruciating pain in her belly, and her internal organs seemed to have been ripped from their positions. Xu Yun grit her teeth, and the hatred in her eyes seemed as if it could turn into sharp blades and cut Huo Yuhao to pieces. However, she couldn’t speak because she was in too much pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Dai Luoli glared at Huo Yuhao and shouted furiously,“How can you be so hard on her? She’s a girl! Don’t you know how to be gentlemanly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “On a battlefield, do you think your enemies will let you off just because you’re a girl? Furthermore, she’s hurt not because of me, but you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was stunned. “Me? You were the one who hurt her. Why am I to be blamed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao scornfully said, “You like her, right? Since you like her, you should treat her like your woman. When she was hurt, what were you doing? You can’t even protect your own woman. Don’t you think you’re a useless piece of trash?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Normally, Dai Luoli was already used to how Huo Yuhao tried to agitate him. However, it was different today. He agitated him in front of Xu Yan! Moreover, Huo Yuhao had already hurt Xu Yun. Suddenly, Dai Luoli’s eyes turned red, and he roared furiously. He unleashed his White Tiger and charged towards Huo Yuhao without regard for anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three seconds later...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Dai Luoli crashed forcefully to the ground a short distance away from Xu Yun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A piece of trash is a piece of trash. If I want to kill your woman or do anything to her now, what can you do? You can only watch helplessly.” He became even more scornful. He even placed his hands behind his back and revealed a disdainful look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to fight it out with you!” Dai Luoli’s eyes had turned completely red by this point. He leaped forward again and charged towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another three seconds passed...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Dai Luoli crashed forcefully to the ground not far in front of Xu Yun again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Dai Luoli quickly climbed up without Huo Yuhao needing to agitate him. After this, he charged towards Huo Yuhao once again like a crazed tiger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A smile appeared in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. At the same time, he also noticed that there was something different about the look in Xu Yun’s eyes right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, all this didn’t stop him from beating Dai Luoli up again and again. Three seconds passed, then passed again. Dai Luoli had been thrown to the ground more than ten times. This time, Huo Yuhao was more violent against him. Not only was Dai Luoli’s shirt torn, but there were even injuries on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao had clearly agitated Dai Luoli a lot this time. Every time Dai Luoli was thrown to the ground, he would crawl up crazily and proceed to attack Huo Yuhao with all his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Dai Luoli was thrown onto the ground in front of Xu Yun another time, and his mouth was already oozing blood, Xu Yun couldn’t help but shout, “Stop fighting! You’re not as good as him. Stop fighting!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I have to protect you. I must protect you.” Dai Luoli suddenly turned his head back. When Xu Yun looked into his eyes, she saw a hysterical and crazed look. Within this craziness, she could see a slight mania in it. Dai Luoli was persistent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished speaking, Dai Luoli charged towards Huo Yuhao once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded silently in his heart. This was because he could clearly tell that the part of Dai Luoli’s martial soul that possessed spiritual power was slowly being awakened. His spiritual power was increasing at a shocking speed as he was in this crazy state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, this was the true essence of his mutated White Tiger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Dai Luoli’s attacks were obviously much more ferocious than before. Furthermore, he would form some white shadows around him as he charged towards Huo Yuhao. On a closer look, one would see that these shadows were shaped like White Tigers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli’s speed and strength were both increasing as he released spiritual undulations. The white lights around his body also became much stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feelings stimulated one’s heart and spiritual power. Huo Yuhao wanted Dai Luoli to enter a realm that was similar to the one he entered when he yearned for Wang Dong’er and created his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did he kick Xu Yun in the same place on both occasions? Did he really not know what it was to be a gentleman? Would he really attack a woman so freely? Of course not. What he was trying to do was make Dai Luoli think that he couldn’t protect the woman he loved. This was why he suddenly used actions and words to agitate Dai Luoli.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were indeed very effective. Dai Luoli had gone berserk now. His soul and spiritual power greatly increased in such a state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, even Dai Luoli couldn’t keep count of the number of times he was thrown to the ground by Huo Yuhao. As he collapsed once again, he tried his best to crawl back up. However, the pain that he suffered stopped him from doing so, even though his soul power kept on recovering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there were injuries all over his body, and his uniform was already torn and tattered. However, he still seemed very persistent. Even though his body was greatly hurt, the look in his eyes was still burning strongly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop fighting, stop fighting.” Tears flowed down Xu Yun’s cheeks. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to stop Dai Luoli or help him. It was just that an unknown force was restraining her as Dai Luoli kept on charging crazily towards Huo Yuhao. She could see and hear everything, but she couldn’t move. She tried her best to struggle, but she couldn’t even gather a shred of her soul power. She could only watch helplessly as Dai Luoli charged towards Huo Yuhao time and time again, and failed time and time again.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao was like a devil in her eyes, whereas Dai Luoli’s persistence and determination caused her to be moved once again.</span></p>

Right now, he looked very scary. His body was already bloodstained, and his eyes were particularly bright. There seemed to be an extra blood-red pupil beside his black pupils too.</span></p>

His back shone brightly with white light, and this white light seemed to be stained by the blood-red on his body, and slowly turned red, creating a projection of a Blood Tiger.</span></p>

The sharp blades of light above his claws also slowly turned blood-red. He twisted his head and looked at Xu Yun with his weird-looking eyes. He said, word by word, “I can definitely protect you. I will protect you.”</span></p>

His speed was even faster than what it was at his peak state. He turned into a blood-red whirlwind and swept towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

Right now, Dai Luoli’s fighting strength was already beyond what a four-ringed Soul Ancestor was able to achieve. His potential was finally being realized.</span></p>

However, the mutation of their martial soul would only truly be completed after the spiritual components in their martial soul had been triggered. Only then would they become stronger than ordinary soul masters!</span></p>

However, Huo Yuhao was different. He probably possessed the strongest spiritual-type martial soul in the world right now. After one month of interaction with Dai Luoli, he was very clear about Dai Luoli’s condition!</span></p>
