 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another Huo Yuhao suddenly appeared, and this time, he appeared behind the Scorpion Tiger Douluo. The Huo Yuhao who had appeared before was still in the sky. Two identical people appeared at the same time. How could that not be astonishing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Interference Domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s second domain-type ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not many people paid attention to this domain because it wasn’t as well-known as his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. But there were many instances where his Spiritual Interference Domain was much more fearsome than his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. Not a single one of the four soul skills that the Skydream Iceworm’s million year soul ring had bestowed upon him were useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Formidable soul power undulations erupted in the sky as Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw sliced through the air and went straight for the Scorpion Tiger’s enormous martial soul true body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brutal force to break brutal force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng was affected by Huo Yuhao’s formidable Spiritual Confusion and single-target enfeeblement. He couldn’t possibly dodge this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But just as Huo Yuhao’s claw struck Zhang Peng, he suddenly trembled vigorously before a dark golden beam of light erupted from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s Scorpion Tiger True Body was torn to pieces in front of Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw. However, a dark shadow suddenly appeared soundlessly behind Huo Yuhao’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Frightening sharp blades went straight for Huo Yuhao’s heart from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Exuviating Cicada! It was one of the Scorpion Tiger Douluo’s automatic defensive soul skills, and this soul skill was known as a godly skill compared to his other soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This soul skill was automatically triggered when Zhang Peng was struck with an attack that he couldn’t defend himself against. If this automatic release was successful, then his original body would be extracted, and he would use thirty percent of his soul power to instantly teleport himself to wherever he wanted. Zhang Peng had cultivated this soul skill to its highest possible level, and he could reach anywhere within a thousand meters with it. At the same time, Exuviating Cicada allowed him to use another thirty percent of his soul power to unleash an attack at his peak condition. However, he couldn’t use any other soul skills during this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sixty percent of the Scorpion Tiger Douluo’s soul power would be expended after this attack, so he would evidently be unable to continue the battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This attack was excellent in a fight to the death, and it was also excellent in ambushing others! There would always be many strange and peculiar soul skills in the world of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng had thought that he would definitely win this battle when he first locked horns with Huo Yuhao because Huo Yuhao had already fought three times before this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when they truly clashed, Huo Yuhao’s formidable spiritual power and his Spirit Eyes’ various soul skills made Zhang Peng understand that he was no match for Huo Yuhao even when he had already expended so much energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Shock was no longer effective, so Huo Yuhao didn’t use it, but Zhang Peng still couldn’t take Huo Yuhao’s other spiritual-type soul skills. The gap between their spiritual powers was just too vast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Zhang Peng had no choice but to go all-in. In that moment when he was struck by Spiritual Confusion, Zhang Peng could have done something to weaken part of the soul skill’s effects, but he decided against it. Instead, he chose to take the soul skill’s entire effect. The reason for his choice was so that he could retaliate and end the battle with his Exuviating Cicada.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng would defeat his enemy and win this battle if he was successful, but if he wasn’t, then he would turn and escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng was a member of the Holy Ghost Church’s Worship Hall, but he never considered placing his life on the line for the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s idea was good, and his tiger claws were already right behind Huo Yuhao’s heart. Everything was going according to plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, he forgot about something. Huo Yuhao still had another extraordinary skill, and that was Spiritual Detection!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Detection conferred three-dimensional detection to Huo Yuhao, and even if he didn’t realize anything when Zhang Peng began his attack, his reappearance with all those soul power and spiritual power undulations in the air was long within Huo Yuhao’s senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Zhang Peng’s tiger claws still sliced through the air anticlimactically in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Missing an attack at full strength was even more agonizing than taking a heavy hit from an enemy. Zhang Peng almost vomited blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And Huo Yuhao? He reappeared behind Zhang Peng’s back. His Darkgolden Terrorclaw didn’t grow bigger this time, but a five sharp &nbsp;dark golden about thirty centimeters long plunged into the Scorpion Tiger Douluo’s back and protruded from his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s body froze in midair. The corner of his mouth curved, as he was very unconvinced and unwilling about what had just happened. His eyes were filled with hysteria, and his soul power immediately erupted from his dantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s heart had been impaled, and he couldn’t possibly continue living. He had dominated the world throughout his lifetime, and he wasn’t willing to just die like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s stable soul core within his dantian was suddenly triggered by his riling soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Self-destruction! This was Zhang Peng’s final choice. He had to take Huo Yuhao with him even if he had to die and disappear from the world. A Transcendent Douluo’s self-destruction was comparable to that of a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell. Zhang Peng chose such a brutal path, and he lived up to his name as the Scorpion Tiger Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s muscles immediately contracted, and even his skeleton was withdrawn toward his chest. Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw was instantly stuck. Zhang Peng was using his full strength right before his death to tie Huo Yuhao down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s eyes weren’t dimming at all in this moment. There was only hysteria in his eyes, an otherworldly insanity, the kind that didn’t belong to this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he had chosen to self-destruct, then he had to pull Huo Yuhao down with him. He wouldn’t give him a chance to survive at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Transcendent Douluo’s eruption right before his death was absolutely terrifying. Not even an Ultimate Douluo could easily shake Zhang Peng’s grip within a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng even raised his hands and used his own tiger claws to clamp down on the Darkgolden Terrorclaws protruding from his chest. He used all the strength he had left to channel his soul core and stop Huo Yuhao from leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he couldn’t see Huo Yuhao, who was still behind him. Huo Yuhao didn’t panic at all because of Zhang Peng’s retaliation right before his death. His expression didn’t even change. There was only pity in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pity was towards a dying man, towards one who had been defeated, and towards a formidable individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao planted his left palm soundlessly on Zhang Peng’s back, while his torso, which was almost pressed against Zhang Peng’s back, erupted with intense bluish-green colors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s formidable Ice Empress’ Wrath immediately swallowed Zhang Peng’s body and bathed his entire body in bluish-green light. A cold sensation that chilled even his heart followed his veins as it coursed through his body. Zhang Peng didn’t have any strength to resist this because they were so close together, and he was using his full strength to trap Huo Yuhao and trigger his own soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Transcendent Douluo’s retaliation right before his death was powerful. However, how could a Titled Douluo who had spiritual power that rivaled that of an Ultimate Douluo, who possessed two formidable soul cores and had an Ultimate Ice martial soul, be any weaker when he had the absolute upper hand?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s body immediately froze, and he realized to his intense fear that his rapidly exploding soul core’s rotation was starting to slow after he was struck. Zhang Peng’s blood was also starting to freeze, and every ounce of strength that he had left was quickly disappearing as his heart froze over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Zhang Peng wanted to shout at the top of his lungs, but his voice stuck in his throat. He could only wheeze, and he could no longer speak with that originally bright and clear voice of his.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Darkgolden Terrorclaw vanished, and Zhang Peng’s blood, muscles, and skeleton had been frozen. He could no longer trap Huo Yuhao’s claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Peng’s tiger claws crumbled and broke as the two figures separated in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shadows flickered as Huo Yuhao reappeared a thousand meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bluish-green flames erupted in the air like firecrackers exploding through the sky. But a formidable soul master who had dominated the entire Continent, who was a Transcendent Douluo, was obliterated just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao descended from the sky, and his aura seemed to be raised to its highest possible level in this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battle wasn’t that magnificent or spectacular, but everyone who was watching fell silent at the outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the fourth one. This was already the fourth one, and two had perished in battle. Huo Yuhao used his formidable strength to tell everyone that what he had claimed about ten battles wasn’t an impossible task.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s expression was as black as could be. However, there was no turning back for him. He was already sustaining such heavy losses, and if he still couldn’t gain anything from it, the Holy Ghost Church would be taking an overwhelming blow in both their strength and their mental states. He was supervisor to the Sun Moon Empire’s entire army, and if his reputation suffered like that, how would those soul engineers who never had a good impression of him think about him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s dark and gloomy expression gradually turned cold. As matters were, he could only capture Huo Yuhao and win this battle so that he could make up for everything that had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gradually drifted down, while Zhongli Wu raised his head and stared at him with burning eyes. There was a tinge of hysteria in Zhongli Wu’s eyes amid all that iciness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The same hysteria in Zhongli Wu was vastly different from Zhang Peng. Zhang Peng’s insanity was retaliating when on the brink of death, but Zhongli Wu’s insanity was like a sharp knife plunging into Huo Yuhao’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s breathing became a little rushed, and it seemed like he had expended a lot of energy from his four continuous battles. However, his eyes were still as calm as ever, and he wasn’t affected by his breathing. Huo Yuhao stared back at Zhongli Wu sharply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Zhongli Wu’s eyes were like a razor-sharp knife, then Huo Yuhao’s eyes were like mountains of ice. No matter how sharp that knife was, it couldn’t pierce through the mountain, which seemed like it was made from mysterious ice over ten thousand years, and descending from the sky with a crushing pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody knew how much energy Huo Yuhao had expended besides himself, and Zhongli Wu could only make certain judgments based on the soul skills that Huo Yuhao had used in his previous fights.</span></p>
