 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

My life energy was naturally very prosperous. However, this thing is completely irrational. It just keeps on absorbing my life energy every day. I tried to expel it from my body, but it seemed to grow inside my body instead. No matter what I did, I couldn’t drive it out. I could only look on helplessly as it sucked my life energy away every single day, until it was almost drained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Given my current state, I don’t dare to ask other soul beasts for help. Di Tian wouldn’t let me off if he found out about this. This is why I can only let you humans take advantage of me. At least I’ll be able to survive longer in a different form in this way. This is why I say one shouldn’t be greedy! Greed kills! Ah ah ah!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone had a different feeling when they saw this Golden Tortoise wailing so depressingly. However, most of them were alerted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes! Greed was fatal. While Life Gold was a good thing, this Golden Tortoise’s life energy was slowly sucked away after it swallowed the metal into its body, to the point where it was about to die. This was a very heavy lesson to learn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Golden Tortoise spoke up to here, its fusion with Xu Sanshi was about to be completed. However, its body still didn’t disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its huge body slowly drifted into mid-air and started to shrink. During the process of shrinking, its golden tortoise shell became brighter and brighter. It seemed to be molten gold as it shot out light in all directions. The earlier release of the immense life energy seemed to be ending. Most of it had been devoured by the Life Guardian Blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Golden Tortoise’s body shrank until it was only one meter in diameter, it suddenly whooshed and flew over to Xu Sanshi, and was imprinted onto Xu Sanshi’s Xuanwu Shield, which was showing behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi’s shield and the tortoise shell suddenly resurfaced, and Xu Sanshi’s body jerked. Following this, a red soul ring instantly rose from beneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His seventh soul ring was a hundred-thousand-year soul ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Xuanwu Shield slowly revolved behind him. Ridges started appearing on the tortoise shell. Just like the Golden Tortoise’s back, the snake was now dyed gold, and the entire Xuanwu Shield was also covered with a layer of dark gold light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With just a glance, it was possible to sense the thick aura exuding from this shield. It felt indestructible, as if it could provide an eternal defense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was delighted. He waved his right hand, and his Xuanwu Shield flew into his hands. Instantly, his entire body was covered with a layer of dark golden light. His seventh red soul ring surged with light continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t just a hundred-thousand-year soul ring. It was also a hundred-thousand year Spirit! Besides Huo Yuhao, he was the only other person with a hundred-thousand year Spirit. The Golden Tortoise didn’t just give him two soul rings, it provided him with an all-around enhancement. His Xuanwu Shield had completely evolved into a Xuanwu, and it even carried the aura of a Golden Tortoise now. More accurately speaking, it carried the aura of a Golden Xuanwu now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the life energy that the Golden Tortoise brought to him was sufficient for him to cultivate until he became a Titled Douluo. The overall enhancements that he had received completely consolidated his foundation to become a Transcendent Douluo in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Xu Sanshi was holding his Golden Xuanwu Shield right now. He could clearly sense his defensive strength soaring. As he held this shield, he felt completely worry-free. It was something that he had never experienced before. Even when he didn’t circulate his soul power, his Golden Xuanwu Shield was still extremely strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was there even anything else that was more wonderful than this? Xu Sanshi danced in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, a jade-green light flashed, and a piece of metal separated from the Golden Xuanwu Shield. It dropped onto the floor and made a jingling sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This piece of metal didn’t seem very big. Its shape was also not uniform, and there even seemed to be teeth marks on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tortoise’s voice sounded, but it was sighing. “It’s finally out. This terrifying fellow has troubled me for thousands of years. Whoever wants it, quickly put it away. Don’t let the Emerald Swan see it. Otherwise, the Beast God will find trouble with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi didn’t take it. Instead, he looked at Huo Yuhao and said, “Little junior, quick!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned for a moment, “Third Senior, Life Gold is invaluable. It should belong to you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi laughed and replied, “Forget it, I have no use for this thing. In addition, this Tortoise really hates it. I believe you are the only one who really knows how to use it. Just put it away for now. We can talk about it later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t one to procrastinate either. He nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll keep it for now, but it belongs to the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Life Guardian Blade in the air fell downward and stuck closely to that piece of Life Gold. Suddenly, a magical scene appeared. Streaks of jade-green light were released from the Life Guardian Blade. The piece of Life Gold seemed to have been devoured, and slowly melted before fusing within the Life Guardian Blade, becoming a part of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, the Life Guardian Blade was only as big as a carving blade, but as it consumed this piece of Life Gold, it was now slowly becoming more like a dagger. Even Huo Yuhao was stunned when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did the Life Guardian Blade devour the Life Gold? He just said that it’s going to be part of the Tang Sect in the future, but now…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What Huo Yuhao didn’t know was that his Life Guardian Blade was strongly supporting his life after he had nurtured it for so long, and after his immense spiritual power fused with Wang Qiu’er’s power of destiny. Naturally, the piece of Life Gold was much stronger than any ordinary Life Gold. But although that piece of Life Gold had devoured the Golden Tortoise’s life energy and was very strong, a lot of its life energy was released under the effect of the pact earlier. Furthermore, it was absorbed by Huo Yuhao’s Life Guardian Blade. It was at its weakest state right now, so it was easily devoured by Huo Yuhao’s Life Guardian Blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t know that his Life Guardian Blade had slowly developed its own sentience as he nurtured it. Although it wasn’t considered intelligent yet, it was still capable of strengthening itself as it devoured the Life Gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao thought of something, his Life Guardian Blade flew back in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade-green dagger was now around seven inches in length, and looked more like a flying dagger. It seemed slightly thicker than its original appearance. The shiny and translucent blade of the dagger shone brightly with jade-green light, and Huo Yuhao could feel the strong life aura coming from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt very fortunate that he couldn’t swallow a carving blade back then, and more fortunate that he had had Electrolux to guide him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, he had also fused with a piece of Life Gold. However, the difference between him and the Golden Tortoise was that he had used his spiritual power to complete his fusion with his Life Gold, whereas the Golden Tortoise had simply swallowed it. After using his spiritual power to fuse with and nurture his Life Gold, he finally received positive feedback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After devouring that piece of Life Gold and the immense life energy it contained, Huo Yuhao could subtly sense thin arteries and veins developing inside his Life Guardian Blade. These thin arteries and veins were like human blood vessels, and there seemed to be something flowing in them. It could only be life energy flowing inside his Life Gold, but how did it take a fluid form? Right now, his Life Guardian Blade was like a living entity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao used his right index and middle fingers to gently grab hold of his Life Guardian Blade. Suddenly, everyone saw a layer of jade-green light constantly flow over Huo Yuhao’s body from the Life Guardian Blade. As the jade-green light flashed, Huo Yuhao seemed to enter a sublime state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought of something, his Life Guardian Blade turned into a ray of jade-green light and re-entered his Eye of Destiny. The immense life energy it brought with it caused Huo Yuhao’s body to shudder several times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This life force, which seemed to have turned material, actually caused his spiritual and soul power to fuse even more. Huo Yuhao could subtly sense something as they blended together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He subconsciously lifted his head to look into the sky. Even though he could only see the roof of the Spirit Transmission Tower, his eyes had turned transparent at this instant. He seemed to be able to penetrate everything with his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was drawn by Huo Yuhao’s gaze. No one said anything, or rather, no one dared to say anything. Right now, Huo Yuhao had entered an extremely strange state. It was like time and space had stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong was the most astonished. She was in a daze as she looked at Huo Yuhao’s eyes. She was in complete disbelief.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Impossible, how is this possible? Why do I see my father’s eyes in his eyes? He only has seven rings! How is this possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This state didn’t last for very long before Huo Yuhao lowered his head, and his gaze calmed down. However, in just these few dozen seconds, he seemed to have changed completely. His soul and spiritual power didn’t increase, but he seemed to have become different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the four Spirits, the Snow Empress’ expression seemed to have become more agile. She turned around and hugged the Ice Empress beside her. She sincerely said, “Ice, thanks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After she finished speaking, she turned into a streak of white light before disappearing into Huo Yuhao’s body. The Ice Empress was stunned. She subconsciously turned around and looked at the Skydream Iceworm. After hesitating for a moment, she drifted in front of him and gently hugged him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Skydream, thanks.” After she finished speaking, she also flew towards Huo Yuhao and disappeared into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm was tearing up heavily. It was unknown whether he had sensed something, or whether he was touched because the Ice Empress had hugged him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm flew in front of Huo Yuhao. He didn’t immediately fuse into Huo Yuhao’s body. Instead, he opened his arms wide and hugged Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, thank you. You’ve finally let us see hope.” After he finished speaking, he turned into a streak of flowing light before fusing into Huo Yuhao’s body and disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass swayed gently, and didn’t say anything. However, the icy-blue glow from its body had evidently become much stronger. It leaned closer to Huo Yuhao’s face. After that, it fused into his body and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else was confused when they saw all this. It was only Huo Yuhao who understood why the four Spirits had acted in this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, they finally saw hope. They saw hope that Huo Yuhao could possibly transcend the mortal world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he was only a Soul Sage now, they could sense what had happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao felt it the clearest. After he re-fused his Life Guardian Blade and his spiritual world and soul power took one more step towards complete fusion, he seemed to have heard a call. He didn’t know where it came from. It was a call that was guiding him towards the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt that he saw another world. The call that he heard sounded very ethereal, but it gave him an indescribably strange feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, an indescribable, terrifying aura was suddenly released from Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone around suddenly appeared very astonished. That terrifying aura, which was filled with dark power, surged like a sovereign that had descended. Everyone was suppressed by this aura and couldn’t move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same for Huo Yuhao. A streak of pitch-black gas spread around his entire body. His skin started to grow black scales, and a thick aura of darkness instantly engulfed his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire outside seemed to have been covered. Huo Yuhao’s eyes immediately turned dim. Everything had happened too suddenly, but it struck him very strongly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The connection that Huo Yuhao had sensed earlier was cut. He seemed to have returned to the state that he was in before he fused with his Life Guardian Blade. It was like whatever had happened before had ceased to exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark power slowly disappeared. The scales also slowly retracted into Huo Yuhao’s body. The terrifying aura also disappeared, and everything returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao seemed to have guessed that this would happen. His expression was very calm. As he looked at everyone around him, who were all very astonished, he smiled slightly as he shook his head and said, “I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, his spiritual sea started to surge with waves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Skydream Iceworm, Ice Empress, Snow Empress and even the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass started to roar maniacally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass had the weakest cultivation among the four Spirits. In fact, it had only existed in this world for ten thousand years. It had only reached a hundred-thousand year cultivation because it was bred by the Icefire Yin Yang Well. However, even it could sense that Huo Yuhao’s change was something very rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, Huo Yuhao must have had sensed the Godly Realm! However, this sensation was cut short by the sudden force that came afterward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this sensation had remained, Huo Yuhao might have found it easier to become a God in the future. Such an opportunity was extremely valuable, even for an Ultimate Douluo. The reason why they were so moved was that they truly saw how they could transcend this world and avoid the wheel of reincarnation by following Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
