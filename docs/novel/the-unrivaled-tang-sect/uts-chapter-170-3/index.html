When he saw Huo Yuhao lying on a bed in the infirmary covered in his own blood, his heart threatened to jump out of his chest. He was shocked, and his blood boiled with rage. He was about to become very, very, violent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Teacher Fan Yu, don’t be too agitated. Huo Yuhao is fine. Look, he’s only sustained superficial wounds. Jiayi, explain what happened to Teacher Fan Yu,” Jing Hongchen said gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu’s eyes burned with fury and he interrupted, “There’s no need to explain anything Hallmaster. I only want to ask you one thing. If Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen were injured like this in Shrek Academy, how would you react? I won’t speak on this further. You should know what to do.” After he finished speaking, he turned around and left. He didn’t even glance at Huo Yuhao again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen was stunned, watching Fan Yu walk away. He was puzzled—Fan Yu was leaving just like that? He didn’t even bother to listen to an explanation or check up on Huo Yuhao? What?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know that, just as Fan Yu was about to erupt, Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Detection to share his thoughts with Fan Yu. Huo Yuhao also told Fan Yu that he was fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fan Yu’s fury wasn’t a pretense. However, he’d already fully calmed down mentally before he spoke to Jing Hongchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hallmaster, what should we do?” Lin Jiayi asked anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen’s expression was extremely grim, “It’s all that Wang Shaojie’s fault. How dare he lead outsiders to make an arrest in our academy? Expel him immediately. Kick him out of our Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jiayi hesitated. “But we don’t have proof that he did it…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen was bothered as he interrupted, “Why would I need any proof to expel a student? Follow my instructions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Lin Jiayi was petrified. He was an intelligent person, he was able to become the teaching director after all. He could subtly sense something in Jing Hongchen’s words. It seemed like Jing Hongchen had finally made a decision on the empire’s current situation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s wounds were hurriedly tended to. When Jing Hongchen found him, it was undeniable that Huo Yuhao was gravely injured. He wasn’t putting on a show. Of course, Jing Hongchen didn’t know that Huo Yuhao had torn the former wounds on his back deliberately, making him appear to be in an even worse state. However, Huo Yuhao controlled his soul power well, and only tore the skin on the surface of his wounds. His muscles were untouched, and he was healing properly. Besides some loss of blood, he wasn’t in much danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The few healing-type soul masters in the academy helped him stitch his wounds up and used healing-type soul skills to aid his recovery. His injuries stabilized very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How’s his condition?” Jing Hongchen asked a doctor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He’s not too injured. He just lost far too much blood. But, we don’t know what could have caused such injuries. It’s a very complicated wound, and it’s impossible for it to have been inflicted by any type of weapon or tool that we know of. We gave him some medicine that boosts his natural blood production. This young man is very fit. We think he’ll see a full recovery within ten to fifteen days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen nodded, and he couldn’t help but think of what Fan Yu had said before leaving. If his grandchildren were in a state like this, what would he do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wake him up for me. I have something for him to hear.” Jing Hongchen instructed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” The doctor took out a small bottle and placed it under Huo Yuhao’s nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was awake already. But when he inhaled, a burning yet refreshing feeling surged through his nose. He was jolted, and he sneezed before opening his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huo Yuhao, I am Jing Hongchen.” Jing Hongchen stepped to the side of the bed where someone had already placed a chair for him. He wore a friendly look as he watched Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greetings, Hallmaster.” Huo Yuhao’s voice was a little hoarse, and he sounded slightly weak too. It was almost like he was actually out of breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen pondered for a moment before he said, “I’m sorry for what happened earlier today. Our academy didn’t do its job to protect you well. The perpetrators who arrested and tortured you have already been punished. Also the academy will toughen up our management, we’ll not let anyone harm you again. I hope that you can forgive us. I extend my deepest apologies to you on behalf of the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a man! No wonder Elder Mu always commented that he was a highly adaptable person, one with a hot temper though.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head slightly and said, “Hallmaster, you’re not to blame for this. You don’t have to apologize. In addition, the mastermind behind those perpetrators was the man who appeared outside the interrogation room after the incident. He instructed those five guys to torture me. Honestly, I didn’t expect this to happen either. With the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s current status, I really didn’t think that anyone would be brazen enough to arrest someone in the academy. My injuries aren’t an issue. They’re nothing for a soul master like me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, I’ve hoped to learn something from the exchange. I’ve been in the academy for some time now, but I’ve learned nothing apart from some basic theories. I’ll only lose more time because of this delay.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen was secretly hateful. Huo Yuhao might be young, but he was a cunning one. He was using these words to corner Jing Hongchen. However, Jing Hongchen had no choice but to bear with it if he wanted his grandchildren to be safe at Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for a moment, Jing Hongchen said, “The captain of the Royal Stewards, Xu Mochen, is responsible, he is the son of a prince in the imperial clan. I have no real authority over him, but I’ll make him apologize to you personally. The academy also has to bear some of the responsibility for this incident. From now onwards, you can bring back all the materials you use for creating soul tools from the academy, free of charge. However, this doesn’t include blueprints or formation arrays. You don’t have to be tested either. When you recover, ask Xuan Ziwen to bring you into the Illustrious Virtue Hall. I hope this will help you &nbsp;progress and increase your knowledge. Though Elder Mu may have passed away, he’s always been the elder I’ve respected the most. If anyone dares to provoke you in this academy, you must tell me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao revealed a look of gratitude as he realized that one of his objectives was about to be fulfilled. “Thank you Hallmaster for granting me these opportunities. I won’t let you down. I’ll study hard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Hongchen was irked by Huo Yuhao’s sincere expression. He squeezed out a &nbsp;smile and stood up before saying, “Alright, rest well Huo Yuhao. I’ll ask them to give you the best medicines for your treatment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Huo Yuhao nodded his head respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t suffer for nothing. Hehe…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His wounds were taken care of, and Huo Yuhao was sent to a ward in the infirmary to rest. He was given the best care due to Jing Hongchen’s concern over his well-being. Even his meals were much better now. Although not quite as good as Shrek Academy’s meals, he was well-nourished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he didn’t lose as much blood as last time, Huo Yuhao was still tired, because he’d really tried to make the act as real as possible. The stinging pain in his back was greatly relieved with the help of medication, but he became groggy from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the door opened slowly, and someone walked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was as always, very alert, and he activated his Spiritual Detection. However, he became relieved quickly. It was just Ke Ke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, Yuhao…” Ke Ke came to his bedside and called to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very fatigued at this point. He didn’t want to scam Ke Ke either with his deceits, thus he decided to pretend that he was sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke was furious as she muttered to herself, “Those bastards from the Royal Stewards are too vicious. He’s covered in so many bandages. He must be critically injured! His old injuries haven’t even recovered yet. I really want to teach them a lesson. I want to castrate all of them and make them eunuchs.”</span></p>

Ju Zi was a total mystery to him. It was only recently that he realized something about her, it was after he saw Ju Zi with the Crown Prince. While her background was pitiful, she had powers backing her. No wonder she’d mentioned the possibility of meeting him in battle.</span></p>
