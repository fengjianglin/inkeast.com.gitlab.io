 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything that Wang Qiu’er had left for Huo Yuhao was in his body, including her soul bone and soul ring. Wang Qiu’er had mentioned before that she possessed the abilities of a hundred-thousand-year soul beast even though she wasn’t that old, because she was the Emperor Beast. She would have given Huo Yuhao two soul skills from her soul bone and ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao was trying to sense the abilities that came with his sixth soul ring, a weird emotional undulation suddenly surfaced in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were negative emotions, filled with hatred, fury, and the urge to kill. When they first surfaced, Huo Yuhao immediately felt like he was about to go crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gusts of cold were instantly released from his Skull of Destiny, and seeped into his spiritual sea. They quickly suppressed the manic feeling, and he also stopped moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was something wrong with his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scenery was still the same, but he could clearly feel that something wasn’t right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was still the Evildemon Forest, but Huo Yuhao felt as if he were in another world now. It felt like he was being forced out of the normal world by some kind of weird force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Spiritual Dreamland? A domain-type spiritual ability?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was astonished. Even with his current spiritual power that was in the concrete-material realm, emotions still poured into his heart, and caused him to enter some kind of Spiritual Dreamland. His opponent’s spiritual power was undoubtedly very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was he really so unfortunate? Did he really draw the Evileye Tyrant King over?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that was really the case, he was going to die without any chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he focused his gaze, his entire aura changed. Immense spiritual power instantly started to surge out from his body and through his head, like flowing water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The six soul rings of his Spirit Eyes revolved around his body as they shone brightly, especially the last, rose-gold soul ring, which was extremely blinding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rings of distorted light also started to spread out from Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the lights from his body contacted the air from the outside world, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt as if he had drawn open curtains, opened a window, and entered another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything around him turned illusory, and started to ripple. After this, they changed into countless projections of strong soul beasts leaping towards him maniacally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t moved, and just stood where he was. He shut his eyes and pressed his right hand against his forehead. After this, he coldly shouted, “Spiritual! Shock!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tone of the second word sounded gloomier and rougher. At each word, his aura soared higher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Reciting the name of his soul skill was an ability that Huo Yuhao figured out when he went into closed-door cultivation in Sunrise City. He combined the spells and incantations that Electrolux had passed to him with his soul skills, and used those incantations to enhance the strength of his soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t originally succeed in his research into this ability. It was only when his spiritual power achieved a qualitative increase and reached the concrete-material realm that he managed to achieve his target in his first attempt at using this ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The names of his soul skills had become incantations. Even though it was limited to his Spiritual Shock right now, it was still very beneficial to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A purplish-gold glow started to spread from Huo Yuhao’s forehead. It looked like ripples across the pond of reality. Wherever these ripples passed, those distorted projections were all shattered like mirrors that had been smashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good, very good. An interesting human. No wonder you dare to step into my territory. So it turns out that you are adept at spiritual abilities. It seems like you are specially here to hunt those from my species. It’s a pity that you’re doomed today, even though you’re a spiritual-type soul master.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything around him became normal again. Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Detection to look in the direction the voice had come from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned around. When he saw the owner of that voice, he straightened his gaze, and his expression immediately became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an Evileye; a strange, but powerful Evileye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just from its color, it was clear that it was much more arrogant than the Fiery Evil Tyrant earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The body of this Evileye, or rather its huge eye, was silver-white.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its size was even more terrifying. It was more than three meters across. The Fiery Evil Tyrant earlier seemed like a little kid in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was even more shocked that this Evileye had sixteen drooping tentacles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The number of tentacles was also a semi-definite way of determining the strength of an Evileye. The more tentacles an Evileye had, the stronger it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fiery Evil Tyrant earlier had only had six tentacles, but it was already very strong offensively. If Huo Yuhao hadn’t used his Spiritual Shock to destroy it, he would have found it very difficult to resist its specialized fire-type attack, the Fiery Gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this Evileye actually had sixteen tentacles, and they were all silver-white, just like its body. This also meant that this Evileye only possessed one element, or possibly two elements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was definitely a spiritual-type soul beast. As for whether it had a second element, Huo Yuhao couldn’t tell yet. From the spiritual-type soul skill that it had unleashed earlier, it was likely to be from the same bloodline as the Evil Emperor. Evileyes from this bloodline were purely of the spiritual element, and they held a very high status among Evileyes as the most noble. In addition, their abilities were extremely powerful. Huo Yuhao was in luck!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hundred-thousand-years! Is this a hundred-thousand-year Evileye Tyrant?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao twisted the edge of his lips.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aren’t I too unbelievably fortunate? I’m getting whatever I want. It’s just that I have to be able to handle this ‘dish’ that’s been presented to me! And it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be so easy…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll only know who’s dead and who’s alive after fighting!” While this was a crisis, it was also an opportunity. If this were a hundred-thousand-year Evileye of a different type, Huo Yuhao might have just fled. He wasn’t skilled enough to resist a hundred-thousand-year soul beast right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, things were different if this Evileye was really a pure spiritual-type Evileye. Huo Yuhao’s soul power couldn’t compare to his opponent, but he was confident in taking on such a hundred-thousand-year Evileye, given his spiritual cultivation. Moreover, he had even inherited Wang Qiu’er’s Emperor Beast abilities. To a certain extent, he possessed a part of the Emperor &nbsp;Beast’s abilities, even though he was a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao naturally wouldn’t stand still and chat with such a strong opponent. As he spoke, he had already made his move. He knew the importance of seizing the opportunities presented to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White, purple, black, black, black, rose-gold. Six soul rings rose in succession.</span></p>

The shred of spirit that the Fiery Evil Tyrant had escaped with might not be enough to resurrect it, but it was sufficient to inform this Evileye Tyrant of Huo Yuhao’s location. Since his concubine had been killed, this Evileye Turant was naturally furious. He quickly pursued Huo Yuhao, which was also the reason why Huo Yuhao felt a suppressive and ominous feeling in his heart.</span></p>

His eyes immediately turned purplish-gold, and two streaks of materialized, purplish-gold light shot out towards the Evileye Tyrant.</span></p>

The two streaks of purplish-gold light instantly shot forward several hundred meters and landed on the Evileye Tyrant.</span></p>

Just like Huo Yuhao was confident in his own spiritual power, it wasn’t afraid of facing a Soul Emperor, given its cultivation. Even though it could tell that Huo Yuhao was a little weird, and he was able to break out from its spiritual control, it still didn’t regard Huo Yuhao highly.</span></p>

As it raged, the air between Huo Yuhao and the Evileye Tyrant warped drastically, and everything seemed to turn unreal. All the plants in the region started to wither at an alarming rate. They weren’t destroyed directly, but their internal structures were messed up under the effect of the clashing spiritual powers, and their biological integrity was affected.</span></p>

They began to buzz, and a series of terrifying spiritual explosions occurred. Intimidating explosive forces were unleashed in random directions.</span></p>

He shut his eyes as his third and fourth soul rings shone in succession.</span></p>
