 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 13.4: Mysterious Water Pill</strong></p>
 <p>He knew that something must’ve happened to his body. If not, he might not have had such a huge increase in his cultivation from a full half a year of cultivation.</p>
 <p>Just as Huo Yuhao’s heart was filling with doubt, the room to the dormitory opened.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong stuck his head through the door and sniffed the room a few times. After confirming that the room didn’t smell, he slowly walked in whilst hugging his bedding to his body. He threw the bedding onto his bed and spoke unhappily to Huo Yuhao, who was standing there. “You’re really a good one. You’ve ‘shed your mortal body and bones’, but you made me unable to return home. Hmph. You’re treating me to breakfast today.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao looked at Wang Dong with a puzzled expression. “Wang Dong, just what happened to me? Why was I covered with filth when I woke up? My cultivation has even risen by a large amount. It even feels like I’ve done what you just said; I have a sort of ‘shedding my mortal body and bones’ feeling.”</p>
 <p>A simple-looking golden bracelet on Wang Dong’s wrist flashed, causing a round metallic ball to appear in his hand, which he then threw towards Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see how much your soulforce has increased by. This soul tool of mine can test the soulforce of people from the tenth to the thirtieth rank. Just pour your soulforce into it.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Huo Yuhao replied. Gripping the metal ball, he slowly poured his soulforce</p>
 <p>into it.</p>
 <p>The golden ball started to emit a faint layer of yellow light that gradually began to extend outwards. Next, a number appeared on the surface of the metal ball. At first, it was fixed at eleven, but it rapidly jumped up to twelve. As the yellow light continued to extend outwards, the ‘twelve’ also started to gradually tremble. However, Huo Yuhao was already using all of his strength at the moment; he wasn’t able to stimulate the number anymore.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s expression had changed into one of astonishment. “It really is worthy of being called the Mysterious Water Pill! It’s actually increased your soulforce by almost two ranks in a single night. You’re at the peak of the twelfth rank now, only a step away from the thirteenth rank.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s eyes went wide. “Are you telling the truth? What is this ‘Mysterious Water Pill’?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong snatched the testing soul tool back from Huo Yuhao and humphed. Then, he said, “My soul tool is extremely accurate when testing people’s soul ranks. Besides, I don’t benefit from lying to you. Speaking of which, you should thank senior Bei Bei. What sort of relationship do you have with him? He actually just casually slipped you a Mysterious Water Pill that’s worth ten thousand gold when you were unconscious. I’m very skeptical as whether or not he gave you the right pill.”</p>
 <p>When he saw Huo Yuhao’s puzzled face, Wang Dong went ahead and explained, “The Mysterious Water Pill is an extremely mystical pill. Supposedly, it’s a pill that’s specific to a certain water-type sect. However, I don’t know which exact sect that is. When the Mysterious Water Pill is being refined, you need to use the blood essence of ten or so water-type soul beasts, as well as several tens of water-type plants. Afterwards, you’ll also need to mix them in a specific manner before being able to successfully refine it. Water has a cleansing property, so not only can the Mysterious Water Pill greatly heal you, it can also increase your soulforce by a margin. Furthermore, its medicinal properties are extremely gentle, so a soul master of any rank is capable of absorbing its medicinal efficacy extremely well. As for soul masters below the twentieth rank, it can increase their soulforce by a rank at least. However, its most valuable aspect isn’t this; it’s the fact that it can cleanse your muscles as well as your bone marrow.”</p>
 <p>“When we shower normally, we cleanse the filth off the surface of our bodies. On the other hand, the Mysterious Water Pill cleanses the impurities hidden within our bodies. This Mysterious Water Pill is effective for anyone who takes it. To an extremely talented soul master, it might only be akin to adding flowers to a brocade. However, to a soul master with ordinary talent, it’s basically sending them coal during a blizzard. It can expel the impurities within their bodies, as well as nourish their meridians. The increase in potential for an ordinary soul master caused by the Mysterious Water Pill is equivalent to an increase in his innate soulforce by an entire rank. In other words, if your innate soulforce when your martial soul was awakened was only at the first rank, it’ll turn into the second rank after you’ve taken a single Mysterious Water Pill. This is nothing short of a qualitative growth in one’s talent and physique.”</p>
 <p>What Wang Dong didn’t know was that his analogy had actually struck the truth. Huo Yuhao’s innate soulforce was actually the first rank!</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao clearly sensed that the feeling of ‘shedding one’s bones’ he’d felt after taking the Mysterious Water Pill definitely wasn’t just as simple as a mere one rank increase in his innate soulforce. In fact, his cultivation speed had almost quadrupled! Although he wasn’t comparable to the likes of Wang Dong and Bei Bei, who were genius soul masters, he’d become equivalent to an ordinary soul master at least. Cultivation wouldn’t be as difficult as it had been in the past for him anymore.</p>
 <p>“Eldest senior brother….”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but want to shed a few tears. It was his eldest senior brother who’d given him the Mysterious Water Pill, something that was worth ten thousand gold! This friendship given to him by Bei Bei was deeply engraved into his heart.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s luck was truly good. Wang Dong’s explanation of the Mysterious Water Pill wasn’t incorrect at all. Under normal circumstances, the increase provided by the Mysterious Water Pill would be just as he’d described.</p>
 <p>However, Huo Yuhao had taken the Mysterious Water Pill at the perfect moment. After yesterday’s bitter training, his body had received enough tempering that it broke through its limits. He’d essentially completed a thorough ‘warm up’ before he consumed the Mysterious Water Pill. Furthermore, his comprehension towards the Mysterious Heaven Technique had caused the technique to permeate throughout his passageways, allowing it to reside in a sort of warm, nourishing state.</p>
 <p>The overuse of Huo Yuhao’s consciousness had caused him to sink into a comatose state. Due to this, when he absorbed the Mysterious Water Pill, he hadn’t been able to deliberately control the efficacy of the Mysterious Water Pill, allowing it to evenly spread throughout his body. The nourishing effect brought about by the Mysterious Water Pill was completely received by his body.</p>
 <p>There was another important point. The Mysterious Water Pill was a water-type medicinal pill, while his second martial soul that had been bestowed to him by the Skydream Iceworm was an ice-type one. Ice was, in and of itself, another state of water, which caused his absorption of the Mysterious Water Pill to be even more fruitful.</p>
 <p>In addition, following the Mysterious Water Pill’s reconstruction of his body, one of the ten balls of Origin Energy that the Skydream Iceworm had sealed within his body had finally been cracked open by a small amount. A portion of the energy that had spilled out from it had thus fused with his body. Because of this, the increase in his spiritual energy was actually even larger than the increase in his soulforce. This was also the reason why his spiritual awareness had expanded from thirty metres to forty metres.</p>
 <p>The Mysterious Water Pill could be said to have caused an all-around upgrade to Huo Yuhao’s body, which was the reason why he’d experienced such a huge change. This would have enormous benefits towards his future cultivation, and even his Purple Demon Eyes had evolved.</p>
 <p>The Purple Demon Eyes had four major realms—Surveyance, Totality, Mustard Seed, and Boundlessness. When Huo Yuhao used his Spirit Eyes to cultivate the Purple Demon Eyes, he basically achieved twice the effects while putting in half the work. As the Mysterious Water Pill had increased his soulforce, it had also simultaneously spurred on the Skydream Iceworm’s Origin Energy. Thus, when he’d previously cultivated the Purple Demon Eyes, the Origin Energy had created a siphoning effect towards the purple qi on the horizon, thereby allowing Huo Yuhao’s Purple Demon Eyes to directly leap into the Totality realm from the Surveyance realm. In terms of cultivation speed for the Purple Demon Eyes, he could even be said to be the fastest person in all of history. He’d even exceeded the founder of the Tang Sect, Tang San.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t know this yet, but the advancement of his Purple Demon Eyes had caused a large increase in his ability to control spiritual-type skills. When he activated soul skills in the future, his soulforce consumption would be substantially lessened.</p>
 <p>As he looked at Huo Yuhao’s red eyes and slightly blank appearance, Wang Dong patted him on the shoulder and said, “Let’s go and get some breakfast. I want to eat double today!”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao laughed. “Sure. You can even eat quadruple if you want today.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong eyes widened. “You’re the pig here.” Once he spoke, the two couldn’t help but break into laughter. Their embarrassment from last night had disappeared. At such a simple age, the two still had pure hearts.</p>
