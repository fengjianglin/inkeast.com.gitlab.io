When she saw everything in front of her, she was also stunned. It was indeed unimaginable! It was the first time any of them had seen so many soul tools...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go, let’s go down.” Huo Yuhao had regained his awareness by now. After the temporary shock, his eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Butterfly Dragon Transformation twisted to look at Huo Yuhao, “Go down? We aren’t clear about the traps here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “I checked them out earlier. I can confirm that there aren’t any traps.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” Xiao Xiao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao chortled, “You aren’t a soul engineer, or you wouldn’t ask such a question. Everything that’s in storage here is a soul tool, especially those Milk Bottles and stationary soul cannons. What do you think they are? They are explosives! If they explode, they’ll blow this warehouse apart. The entire city might even suffer from the explosion. While they are very stable, a chain reaction might be initiated if even one of these soul tools was hit. In light of this, do you think the Sun Moon Empire will set traps on this level? I sensed it earlier; there aren’t any other soul power undulations other from those coming from these soul tools.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course, they have other arrangements set in place. However, these arrangements are used to prevent explosions. I’m sure that there’s more than one entrance to this warehouse. This side is only one of them. Because they need it to be convenient for transportation purposes, they can’t install too many defensive soul tools here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we remain careful, nothing will happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three ladies understood. The previous two levels were full of all types of rare metals. These rare metals were usually very tough, and didn’t seem to be at risk of an explosion. Even soul rays couldn’t damage them. However, the soul tools on this level were different. It would be a disaster if they blew apart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As they descended the steps and entered the warehouse, that feeling became much stronger. They weren’t threatened at all as they entered the warehouse. Huo Yuhao also activated his Spiritual Detection to sense any changes that might occur.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s voice sounded, “Yuhao, we have to hurry up. You still have a tournament over on the other side. If you drag things out here, what’ll happen to you over there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 32pt"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

Follow the arrangements that I’ve set up. There is still some good stuff here. We must choose what we want to leave with properly. Xiao Xiao, take all the Milk Bottles first. They will be a future source of power for the Tang Sect. Next…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Huo Yuhao’s command, the three ladies quickly took action. They started to do some sneaky things…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---------------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A huge, black dragon covered half of the battlefield. As it opened its wings wide, it seemed to fill the entire sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This black dragon was more than a hundred meters long, and covered in thick scales. Its dim-golden eyes made it feel awe-inspiring. Every time it moved, it would cause huge patches of space to distort. These distorted spaces didn’t spread, but neutralized the surrounding shockwaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opposite this black dragon was a dark-green giant. This giant was close to one hundred meters tall. His developed muscles made him look as if he came from ancient times. A huge dark-green whirlpool with many golden streaks of light within revolved around him continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far from this giant, there was a huge beast that had a horned head that resembled a dragon’s, the spiral horns pointing ahead of it, and a body that resembled a muscular bull. This beast was stepping on clouds formed by a yellow glow. The strength that this beast possessed was such that it felt like the sky had become the earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That black dragon was formed by the Dragon Emperor Douluo, Long Xiaoyao. The blackish-green giant was Du Busi, and the huge bull was the Godly Taotie Bull formed by Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them had been fighting in the sky for quite some time. Indeed, even Elder Xuan and Du Busi weren’t Long Xiaoyao’s match in a duel. However, they had hundreds of years of experience. When they teamed up, they weren’t at a disadvantage. After clashing with Long Xiaoyao several times, they started to reveal crazed looks in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Du Busi and Elder Xuan’s cultivations were almost at the peak of their level. They had already been Rank 98 Titled Douluo for years, and continued to try their best to reach the top. However, it wasn’t easy to become an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Elder Xuan had once had the guidance of Elder Mu, he lost a sparring partner after Elder Mu was critically hurt. It was even more difficult for Du Busi, since he was already the strongest in the Body Sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Long Xiaoyao was one of the few remaining Ultimate Douluo on the continent. He was a Rank 99 Ultimate Douluo, his abilities nowhere inferior to Elder Mu’s. As Elder Xuan and Du Busi fought Long Xiaoyao, they felt like they were fighting to their heart's content. As they basked in such a feeling, they felt that they were getting closer and closer to the next threshold!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao could sense the changes in them. In fact, he was able to greatly harm the both of them, even if he couldn’t kill them. The gap between an Ultimate Douluo and a Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo was actually extremely large.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Long Xiaoyao had his own misgivings. He wasn’t willing to work himself to the bone for the Holy Ghost Church. How long had he been famous? He was probably the strongest living soul master in the world! How could he possibly accept the fact that he was fighting his guts out for a bunch of evil soul masters? He was only doing this for some special reason...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was once best friends with the Dragon God Douluo, Mu En. While they became love rivals later on, their friendship still existed. Elder Xuan could be considered a half disciple of Elder Mu, and was also the pillar of Shrek Academy. Long Xiaoyao wasn’t willing to hurt him, just like he had intentionally let Huo Yuhao go previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he didn’t particularly like Du Busi, Du Busi’s words earlier had still moved him. Long Xiaoyao was still quite sentimental.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, he didn’t give his all in this fight. He even became more conservative when he sensed that the two of them were using him as a touchstone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why the fight between the three of them wasn’t a life-and-death one even though it was very intense. They canceled one another out with their fighting strength. However, they couldn’t control what was happening below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, the ground fight had reached an extremely intense stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Titled Douluo from both parties remained spectators, watching the three of them fight from afar. However, the Sun Moon Empire’s imperial palace was still being invaded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The assault that came from Shrek Academy, the Star Luo Empire, and Heavenly Soul Empire had begun!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">----------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were all masked, but they were extremely strong. As they charged their way into the palace, they killed many of the soul masters, soul engineers, and guards who were defending the palace. They charged straight for Xu Tianran’s imperial study.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were at least Soul Sages, none of them were Titled Douluo. They still had to follow the unwritten rules of the world of soul masters.</span></p>
