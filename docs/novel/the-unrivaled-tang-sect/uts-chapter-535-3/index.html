 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The avenging spirits of twelve aquatic soul beasts appeared. Apart from that mermaid avenging spirit, the other eleven avenging spirits flew towards Tang Wutong. Each of them released a powerful aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid avenging spirit lifted her head. She seemed to sigh. After that, a weird voice was heard from her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her voice was captivating, but she sounded like she was sobbing. She made one feel like crying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was stunned when she heard this voice. She was about to unleash her next soul skill, but she paused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that the eleven avenging spirits encircled her. One of them, which looked like a shark, picked up speed, and charged in front of Tang Wutong. It opened its huge mouth and was about to bite her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While these avenging spirits were only spiritual entities, they could inflict more harm than real entities. This was because they could directly harm souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Tang Wutong was Tang Wutong. She was a nine-ringed Titled Douluo. She was even a Titled Douluo with top-grade twin martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the voice of the mermaid avenging spirit impacted her, she immediately regained her awareness she mimicked a lifting action. In front of her, a huge hexagram array that was more than five meters in diameter suddenly surfaced. Following this, a huge beam of light shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since she got back with Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong had separated some parts from her martial soul before fusing with them again later on. After her memory was fully restored, she was not only able to use every soul skill of her evolved martial souls, but she was also able to use the unevolved soul skills that Wang Dong’er had possessed. Right now, she was using the Hexagram Array!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The beam of light unleashed from the gigantic Hexagram Array was filled with spiritual undulations and an aura of light. The moment the shark avenging spirit touched it, it let out a tragic scream and was glued to it. It couldn’t escape even if it wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong forcefully stomped the ground with her left foot. Suddenly, the hexagram array shone brightly, and the light also intensified. The shark avenging spirit completely melted as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the other ten avenging spirits stalled. The reason why they were so strong was because they conserved some fighting capabilities, and even streaks of soul memories. This was why they could feel fearful too. Evidently, they knew that Tang Wutong could completely curb them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong didn’t care about all that. As she stomped her foot, her fourth soul ring also lit up. A strange layer of bluish-gold scales engulfed her body, turning into dazzling dragon armor. A huge golden dragon also started to revolve around her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was her fourth soul skill, Dragon God’s Possession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s figure flashed, and she charged towards the Abomination Douluo. She punched her right fist into the air. Suddenly, a terrifying blast rang in the air. This time, all space within a few hundred square meters seemed to collapse. The Abomination Douluo, who had just caught his breath, was delayed for a moment. After this, he saw a bright golden fist in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to the Abomination Douluo, Tang Wutong was simply too small. However, at this instant, the Abomination Douluo felt a great sense of fear. It was as if this fist could crush the entire sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Tang Wutong and Huo Yuhao were together, Huo Yuhao was generally the one who attacked. However, this didn’t mean that she couldn’t fight. On the contrary, Huo Yuhao might not even be able to beat Tang Wutong in a duel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Tang Wutong’s martial soul evolved, Huo Yuhao had the feeling that it was like a fusion of Wang Dong’er’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess and Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon. In terms of physical strength and power, it had completely inherited Wang Qiu’er’s best abilities. This was why Tang Wutong was extremely terrifying right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Tang Wutong charged out, she disabled her connection to Huo Yuhao. However, even so, she was still a Titled Douluo, and a powerful one at that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom!” A tremendous boom echoed. The Abomination Douluo used his fists to block her attack. He had already used all his strength and unleashed all his power. What he was most adept at was in fact his physical strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the clash of fists caused him to be flung back. As for the tiny Tang Wutong, she remained motionless in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that a pitch-black door appeared behind Huo Yuhao. If not for the fact that he had finished reciting his incantations, Tang Wutong wouldn’t have left his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A giant foot walked out from the pitch-black door. What appeared next was a massive creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a giant was even bigger than a Terror Knight! It was the Undead Ice Bear King, Er Bai!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t move, and stood where he was. His spiritual senses had already covered the entire place. The reason why he summoned Er Bai wasn’t because he and Tang Wutong couldn’t deal with the two evil Titled Douluo. Rather, he needed to control the entire scene. He was the chief commander of the entire army, and not just fighting on his own. He had to minimize the number of casualties. Therefore, he had to focus on other aspects too, rather than just his own fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this was before, fighting two evil Titled Douluo would be potentially fatal. However, he didn’t really regard them as a threat right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Er Bai squeezed out from the door and immediately roared. He took a step forward. After this, he charged towards the Abomination Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong drifted in mid-air. She was completely covered in dragon armor, and her wings were open behind her back. As a golden dragon revolved around her body, she was like a goddess of war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She raised her right hand, and a beam of golden light shone. It was the Golden Dragon Spear that had belonged to Wang Qiu’er before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every day, Huo Yuhao cultivated with Tang Wutong. As he familiarized himself with her abilities, he passed the Golden Dragon Spear to her. In her hands, it was indeed much stronger as she used it with her Radiant Dragon Butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spear drew an arc in the air, and a golden halo spread outward. The ten aquatic avenging spirits were forced back. At the same time, Tang Wutong turned her attention to the Myriad Soul Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was the Myriad Soul Douluo or the Abomination Douluo, they didn’t expect their opponents to be so strong. Tang Wutong’s consecutive strikes left them very frustrated. Furthermore, they couldn’t tell how strong she was. Was she a Transcendent Douluo? Only a Transcendent Douluo could possibly suppress them. Otherwise, she shouldn’t be so strong even if she had a light-type martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo turned serious. He couldn’t be bothered with what the Ice Bear King was. At this moment, Tang Wutong had completely locked onto him, and a life-or-death fight was about to break out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Myriad Soul Douluo’s seventh soul ring shone, and he turned ethereal. After this, he swept his right hand down, and his banner fell to the ground. Following this, it expanded once again. As for the Myriad Soul Douluo, he turned into an intense ball of red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A weird scene appeared. An image surfaced on the originally pitch-black banner. This image was, blood-red and seemed to be similar to the Myriad Soul Douluo’s face. However, the image of him appeared to be much fiercer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Myriad Soul True Body! This was the Myriad Soul Douluo’s seventh soul skill. He had actually turned into an avenging spirit, and become the main soul of his banner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A low-pitched groan sounded. As sinister winds blew, the entire soul formation turned dimmer. A cold and sinister aura filled the air as the screams of countless avenging spirits echoed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Domain-type soul skill! After the Myriad Soul Douluo unleashed his Martial Soul True Body, he actually unleashed a domain-type ability. No wonder he was an evil Titled Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong revealed a cold look on her face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Domain-type skill? A domain created by his banner would likely strengthen all his avenging spirits. However, does he really think that’s going to work?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The image of the Myriad Soul Douluo wasn’t small. He had evidently realized that it wasn’t enough for him to deal with Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. He needed to deal with the others who had entered the soul formation too. This was why he used his strongest skill, Myriad Soul Domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To use this domain-type skill, the requirements were very strict. First, he had to unleash his Martial Soul True Body. In addition, it was also his eighth soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The combination of two powerful soul skills enabled the Myriad Soul Douluo to unleash his greatest strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, he was already very angry when Tang Wutong killed one of his aquatic avenging spirits. Seeing that the Undead Ice Bear King was out too, he knew that he no longer stood a chance if he didn’t turn to his most powerful skill.</span></p>
