 <p><strong>Book 4: The Golden Road</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 22.1: Fusion of the Three Innate Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p>“Why aren’t you two wearing your chainmail and running? Why’re you two holding hands and romancing one another?”</p>
 <p>Startled, the two hurriedly let go of each other, then ran back towards their dorm rooms. Their hearts were currently beating extremely quickly, and it naturally wasn’t because of Zhou Yi’s shout, but because of the strange change that had occurred to their martial souls!</p>
 <p>The two rushed back to their dorms. As they looked at each other, they could see the trace of astonishment that was present in their eyes. Right, the matter that had just occurred was simply too unusual. Regardless of whether it was Huo Yuhao, who had studied a large amount of info with regards to soul masters after entering Shrek Academy, or Wang Dong, whose knowledge was expansive, this was the first time they had learnt of anything like this; this clearly exceeded the territory of ordinary soul masters.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but say, “It seems like our nap last night wasn’t for nothing!”</p>
 <p>“Pah.” Wang Dong glared at him. But then, he quickly raised his soft, slender hands and said, “Let’s try again.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was also anxious to verify the matter that had just occurred to them. Hence, he hurriedly held hands with Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>As the four hands joined together, the flow of soul power immediately restarted. Their soul power were completely different; The soul power that came from Huo Yuhao’s Mysterious Heaven Technique was honest, moderate, gentle, and unconstrained, while Wang Dong’s soul power was much more overbearing; it had a threatening and noble aura to it.</p>
 <p>If Huo Yuhao’s soul power could be compared to a gentle and honest youth, Wang Dong’s soul power was a noble, aloof, and overbearing young mistress.</p>
 <p>However, these two soul power with completely different temperaments had currently formed a cycle, flowing perfectly through their bodies. Furthermore, these two soul power were actually fusing quietly throughout this process, intimately sharing everything with each other. During this process, there were no conflicts during this process; it was just as if they had originally belonged to a single body.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was left in a slightly better state; after all, the soul power that came from his Mysterious Heaven Technique was extremely gentle in the first place. On the other hand, Wang Dong was filled with astonishment. He was fully aware of how domineering and fierce his soul power was, as well as how strongly it excluded other things from itself. But, his current situation had vastly exceeded his scope of knowledge.</p>
 <p>During the brief moment where the circulation occurred, the two felt extremely relaxed and refreshed. Clearly, it would be much faster for them to cultivate in this state rather than cultivating individually. Furthermore, they clearly knew that this was just the beginning. Their soul power had fused so perfectly, so how could the benefits that arose from this be as simple as allowing them to cultivate together?</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, we should go run first. We can study this further after we get back tonight.” Huo Yuhao took the initiative to let go of Wang Dong’s hands. Then, he put his chainmail on and ran outside.</p>
 <p>After listening to his words, Wang Dong was slightly startled, and his mouth slightly twitched for a moment. Huo Yuhao’s words, in addition to how he had mysteriously hugged him for an entire night, caused a few traces of ambiguity to reluctantly appear in his heart. After making a fist behind his back, he put his chainmail on and caught up to him</p>
 <p>They had already been running with chainmail for three months, so doing it now was a walk in the park for them. The two diligently ran till the bell rang, and only when Xiao Xiao came to the field to find them did they stop. When she arrived, Xiao Xiao informed them that Teacher Zhou had already left.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s entire body was covered with sweat, while Wang Dong, who had a higher cultivation, deliberately made it so that he wasn’t sweating at all.</p>
 <p>“How was it? Did Teacher Zhou say anything?” Huo Yuhao asked as he panted.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao shrugged her shoulders. “Nothing much, really. She just cheered everyone up and gave us some encouragement. After that, she analysed the situation of our opponents. It’s going to be extremely difficult for us to become champions. It seems like the round-robin tournament was only a rehearsal. On the other hand, our Shrek Academy’s never lacked geniuses!”</p>
 <p>As he looked at her somewhat worried expression, Wang Dong said, “What? Even our twin martial soul genius doesn’t have any confidence in herself?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao curled her lips and said, “Confidence is something I naturally have, but I have to say that there are some people who’re more talented than us. Teacher Zhou told us that out of the five teams which achieved complete victories, three had three-ringed Soul Elders. How confident are you againsts three-ringed soul masters?”</p>
 <p>“Soul Elders?” The two simultaneously cried out with a look of inconceivability on their faces.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao smiled bitterly. “Exactly. Why else would I be so unconfident?”</p>
 <p>“What did Teacher Zhou say?” Huo Yuhao asked.</p>
 <p>“When she was talking about those three teams, Teacher Zhou didn’t seem to be too happy about them. It looked like she had just obtained that piece of information. Previously, those three classes had never told anyone that they had students who were Soul Elders. Also, those three students are just like you; they’re specially invited students.” Xiao Xiao replied.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Wang Dong laughed and looked towards Huo Yuhao. “See, you’re all specially invited students, so why is there such a large gap between you and them?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was speechless for a moment before saying, “There’s no use talking about this now, the key thing we need to do now is to think of how we can beat them.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, all we can do is to do our best and let destiny settle everything for us. Those three are the respective team leaders of their own teams, so it’s obvious that they won’t be easy to deal with. Think about it: they were able to break into the three-ringed realm before the age of twelve. Just how strong are their martial souls? Also, there’s definitely a clan that’s fully supporting them from behind, so their soul rings are definitely at their limit. Even if they aren’t as perverted as Wang Dong, who got a thousand-year soul ring as his second soul ring, they shouldn’t be too far off. In my opinion, even Teacher Zhou doesn’t think it’s looking too good for us. I think that we can only aim for fourth place,” Xiao Xiao said.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong snorted. “What if they have three rings? Are Soul Elders unbeatable? We have our advantages as well; You have your twin martial souls, and I haven’t used all of my strength yet. In addition to Huo Yuhao’s spiritual martial soul, the three of us might not lose to anyone else if we team up together.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao said, “Do you think that I don’t want us to become champions! Only the top three get a substantial reward; fourth place doesn’t get any good rewards. However, our combined strength truly isn’t as good as theirs. Think about it, the teammates of a Soul Elder-level student will at least be at the Soul Grandmaster level, just like us. We do have our own strong points, but the only way for us to have a chance is for the class monitor to break into Rank 20 and get another strong spiritual-type soul skill.”</p>
