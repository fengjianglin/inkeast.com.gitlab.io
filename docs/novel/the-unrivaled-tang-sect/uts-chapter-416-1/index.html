Instead, they had Clear Sky Sect disciples escort him out of Clear Sky Castle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stepped out of Clear Sky Castle and watched its large gates close. He took a deep breath and swore to himself that he would have the strength of a Titled Douluo when he returned the next time. It would be best if he could bring Dong’er back with him at that time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He tapped his foot on the ground and leapt down from Clear Sky Peak, just like that. He bounced off the side of the mountain continuously as he rushed down as quickly as he could. He plummeted through the clouds before he extended his flying-type soul tool and activated his soul power, transforming into a ray of flowing light as he disappeared into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian and Tai Tan watched Huo Yuhao leave as they stood by the window in the highest room in the castle. They wore different expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan looked a little gloomy. Evidently, he hadn’t gotten over the fight he had just had with Huo Yuhao. He muttered under his breath, “Life has been hard on this guy! But his mind seems a lot more resilient and resolute than last time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian’s face was full of admiration and appreciation. “Yes! It wasn’t easy for him to become like that at such an age. Hopefully, he can meet that fellow’s requirements as quickly as possible. In truth, I can’t bear to watch this kid being tortured like this. Dong’er – oh, I mean our little phoenix – I wonder what she’s doing at the moment? I’m hoping that they can meet each other outside...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tai Tan said, “That fellow is so cruel. He has quite some skill at torturing people... but do you think our sister knows about this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Niu Tian chuckled and said, “It would be strange if he dared to tell her. However, I can understand what he’s feeling. He’s a man, and when the daughter you love most is being stolen by another man, your mood can’t be too good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

Right now, he was overwhelmed with emotions, and not just because he had received the good news that Dong’er had recovered. He was also excited because of what he was going to do next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had to stop and rest after every two hours because of the state his body was currently in. He found a small city when night fell and stayed the night in a hotel. He continued on his way when dawn broke the next day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took another four hours before he finally left the Heavenly Soul Empire’s borders and entered the Star Luo Empire’s borders. He went straight for the Star Luo Empire’s capital city, Star Luo City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was midday before Star Luo City was within sight. Huo Yuhao slowed down, descended from the sky and landed on the ground. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Star Luo City was the Star Luo Empire’s capital, and their air defenses were very tight and strict. He could run into trouble at any moment within fifty kilometers of Star Luo City, so Huo Yuhao landed on the ground well before that. Furthermore, he didn’t have to go into Star Luo City to reach his destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao found a quiet and isolated place that was devoid of people and removed his flying-type soul tool. He withdrew everything that was relatively eye-catching from his body and placed them into his storage-type soul ring. He turned his ring around so that his Starlight Sapphire was facing his palm. Unless he opened his hand for others to look at, nobody would see the dazzling jewel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He removed Shrek’s uniform and put on some hemp clothes before he took out a series of bottles and cans of paints and cremes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Changing his appearance was part of the training he had received during the Ultimate Soldier Plan. Even though he felt a little unfamiliar with the process as he put on his disguise, his standards were still there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long to change his appearance to that of an unassuming youth who seemed as typical as could be. He looked very simple and honest, and very modest at the same time. He looked like he was a little over twenty years old, his appearance was the kind that was hard to distinguish in a crowd of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao inspected his appearance after making himself up and nodded satisfactorily before he began walking towards Star Luo City. However, his destination wasn’t Star Luo City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

After about one hour, a bunch of structures entered his vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao immediately stopped in his tracks when he saw these structures. He clenched his fists slowly and pressed his lips tightly together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where was this? This place used to be his home! The White Tiger Duke’s residence, the place he had sworn to come back to so that he could avenge his mother. Ever since his mother had passed away, this place was no longer his home. Instead, this had become a place where his enemies lived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke, Dai Yueheng, and Dai Huabin’s faces swiftly surfaced in his mind. The hatred and vengeance that Huo Yuhao had suppressed deep within his heart instantly erupted like a fountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m back, mother! Even though I’m not strong enough yet, I will be in the future, and I will definitely avenge you for good!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He picked up his pace as he walked briskly towards the White Tiger Duke’s residence. Of course, he wouldn’t enter the White Tiger Duke’s Mansion. Instead, he proceeded towards a small patch of hills to the side that bordered the White Tiger Duke’s residence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had grown up in this place, and he was still very familiar with it even though he hadn’t been back here for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly found his destination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A tall gravestone appeared in the distance. This gravestone was at least two meters tall, and both wide and spacious. Its surroundings were renovated and ornamented with granite and seemed fine and exquisite. There were even carvings of the Emperor Beast on the gravestone’s surface, watching over the one interred there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a grave behind this stone, also constructed from granite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes grew wet when he saw this gravestone. He took a few quick steps forward, and the writing on the gravestone’s surface was clearly presented to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Grave of my Wife, Huo Yun.” Dai Hao’s name was etched below this inscription.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the grave of Huo Yuhao’s mother, but it was very different from when he had departed this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, he was still young and didn’t have the means to give his mother a grand burial. He could only use a wooden grave marker that he had carved and sculpted with his own hands, and some loess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, his mother’s gravestone had been renovated, but it was still located where it used to be. However, it looked entirely different from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had not been back here before, and now someone had renovated his mother’s grave. Huo Yuhao was a little dazed as he slowly knelt down in front of his mother’s gravestone. The roiling hatred and vengeance in his heart subconsciously dampened, but tears surged out uncontrollably as he placed his head down in front of his mother’s gravestone and sobbed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mom! Mom, I’m back! I’m here to see you!” Huo Yuhao had been gone for so many years, and this was the first time that he had returned to pay respects to his mother. His heart was full of guilt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had become increasingly powerful over the years and had worked so hard that he almost didn’t rest at all. He didn’t even dare to think about his mother, because he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to resist the impulse to avenge her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More than eight years had gone by since he had left this place.
