 <p><strong>Book 14: The Finals!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 118.2: Shrek Lost?</strong></p>
 <p>Wang Yan rushed forward. There were already healing-type soul masters from the Star Luo Empire coming forward to administer treatment. As men were different from ladies, and the individual round was about to begin, Wang Yan let Xiao Xiao tend to Jiang Nannan temporarily. After that, he reported the seven names he wanted to send out for the individual round.</p>
 <p>These seven were Ma Xiaotao, Dai Yueheng, Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Ling Luochen, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>Yes, both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were being sent out for the individual round. Xu Sanshi was woken up by Ling Luochen using the ice element.</p>
 <p>“Nannan, Nannan!” Xu Sanshi couldn’t help but scream as he regained consciousness. His soul power surged out ferociously.</p>
 <p>“Calm down.” Bei Bei slapped him, and Xu Sanshi only calmed down because of that.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi very soon found Jiang Nannan, who was in Xiao Xiao’s arms. His body was even trembling because he was too agitated.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi was more than a little frantic as he asked, “How is she? How is she?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan came to his side, patted his shoulder and said in a deep voice, “Her injury is very serious, but her life won’t be in any danger. Sanshi, do you want to avenge her?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi turned around suddenly, “Of course.” His voice sounded different because he replied with great enthusiasm.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan nodded and said, “I shall give you a chance. You’ll be the first in the individual round.”</p>
 <p>“Good. I will go up and destroy them.” As he spoke, Xu Sanshi received a Milk Bottle from Wang Yan. He shut his eyes quickly, and regained the soul power that he had depleted earlier.</p>
 <p>For today’s final, Wang Yan had specially bought a few more Milk Bottles in the two days of preparation. Everyone had one of them now, and used them to regain their soul power quickly. The individual round was about to start.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan was very calm. Although he seemed lethargic, he had a resolute look in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Yes, the loss in the team round was part of his plan.</p>
 <p>Shrek was inferior in terms of overall abilities. The Sun Moon team was made up of powerful soul engineers, and they had the most advanced soul tools among those of the same rank. They were undoubtedly the strongest as a team. This meant that they would be most powerful in the team round.</p>
 <p>If they clashed head-on, Shrek’s chances of success wouldn’t be greater than 30%, and so Wang Yan had decisively chosen to give up victory in the team round without knowledge of Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen’s abilities.</p>
 <p>His strategy was very simple. In the team round, all his team members were supposed to conserve. Only Jiang Nannan and He Caitou would unleash their all, because they wouldn’t be in the individual round. They only had one target in the team round – hurt as many of their opponents as possible. It’s important to note that today’s finals would be completed in one go. While the Sun Moon team was very powerful, they had a limited number of soul kings too. Wang Yan also didn’t expect Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen to be soul kings, but even still, the Sun Moon team only had 9 soul kings. If one was taken down, only 8 would be left.</p>
 <p>Reality proved that Wang Yan’s strategy had succeeded.</p>
 <p>Lin Xi and Chen Fei’s deaths were not part of his plan, but a Ma Xiaotao who gave her all was too scary. She couldn’t be merciful at all in this final. Along with a little accident, she actually killed 2 Class 5 soul kings. At the same time, she depleted several Invincible Barriers. More importantly, Xiao Hongchen was severely injured. He was unlikely to participate in the rest of the matches. Out of the 9 soul kings, 2 were killed and 1 was heavily injured. Team Sun Moon was very restricted in who they could send out. This would be very disadvantageous for the later segments of the final.</p>
 <p>However, the blow that Jiang Nannan took for Dai Yueheng wasn’t within Wang Yan’s plan. But he could understand Jiang Nannan’s painstaking intention.</p>
 <p>Although Jiang Nannan was never a phony in front of Xu Sanshi, she was clear that she might bring Xu Sanshi down. That’s why she took the blow for him without any hesitation. It’s important to know that her life might have been lost if her Invincible Golden Body couldn’t hold on long enough! But she still dashed forward and managed to achieve the best result. Xu Sanshi was agitated, and his internal strength was half-awakened. It was also her efforts that caused Xiao Hongchen to be critically injured. It was even fair to say that Shrek’s team had executed Wang Yan’s plan better than expected.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao made the greatest contribution in this team round. Without her, this result would not have been achieved. Even so, Wang Yan did not think that Jiang Nannan made the second greatest contribution. He thought that it was Bei Bei who did so, after he shouted that Shrek conceded defeat at the last moment.</p>
 <p>What’s being able to see the bigger picture? It’s the ability to make the correct choice after judging the situation at the most critical moment.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei had shouted at the right time. The remaining 4 from the Sun Moon team were still very powerful, and they were also very far away from them. Their soul tools could still be preserved in their best states. Even though Dai Yueheng got closer eventually, the Bloodthirsty Demon Ape that Ma Rulong had summoned wouldn’t be easy to deal with. Or at least, it couldn’t be dealt with in a short period of time. Shrek wouldn’t have been able to achieve victory in that situation. Since this was the case, they should conserve their powers and use them in the individual round.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng was the one who was supposed to concede defeat, but it was obvious that he had lost control of his emotions. Wang Yan was more impressed with Bei Bei, as he was able to do what Dai Yueheng couldn’t.</p>
 <p>Both teams had to decide their sequence before the individual round started and relay them to the referee. This was to ensure fairness.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan had already prepared his list earlier on, and passed it to Huang Jinxu. As two members had been killed and one member was severely injured, the teacher in charge of the Sun Moon team had to make changes. This left him extremely frantic.</p>
 <p>“No, I have to compete. I must compete. If I don’t, I won’t be present for the 2-2-3 fight either. Damn it, I’m too cowardly.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Hongchen was still squawking even though he was heavily injured. He wasn’t very bothered by the 2 official team members’ deaths. He was not very good at interpersonal relationships, and those 2 official team members didn’t like him either. But he was feeling indignant!</p>
 <p>Xiao Hongchen had been recognized as the top talent in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s entire history. His talent didn’t just make him a soul engineer, but also an outstanding soul master. He could even perfectly combine these 2 together.</p>
 <p>Both he and Meng Hongchen weren’t sent to compete earlier because they were kept to deal with Shrek Academy later on. But who knew that he would embarrass himself the first time he revealed himself.</p>
 <p>His all-out offense was blocked by a ravishing lady. What was even more unfortunate for him was that he was wrenched into the air by that same lady using her feet. Eventually, he was heavily injured by Dai Yueheng. He was totally embarrassed even before he did anything. How could he not feel depressed?</p>
 <p>Xiao Hongchen’s identity on the Sun Moon team was very sensitive. Their teacher didn’t dare to let him take a risk! After he was critically injured and two of the other students were killed, he quickly withdrew Xiao Hongchen’s participation from the tournament and replaced him with another preparatory team member. What could Xiao Hongchen do?</p>
 <p>Xiao Hongchen still wanted to turn the tide and reveal himself in front of everyone. If he left it just like that, it would be an absolute farce for him!</p>
 <p>That was why he was unwilling to be substituted just like that. As he was treated by the healing-type soul masters, he debated with his teacher. He was unwilling to disqualify himself.</p>
 <p>The teacher said in a deep voice, “Xiao Hongchen, calm down. Don’t forget what you mean to our academy. If something happens to you, how can I account to the hallmaster?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Hongchen raged, “I don’t need you to account to anyone. Isn’t my sister here? If I really die in battle, she’ll explain it to my grandfather. I don’t care, I have to compete. Don’t blame me for complaining to my grandfather if you don’t let me compete.”</p>
 <p>Meng Hongchen was a little annoyed as she said, “Teacher, just let him compete if you have no choice. At most, we’ll not let him fight in the individual round. I think 6 of us is enough. If we can’t and lose, my brother and I can unleash our full strength together for the 2-2-3 fight. He can also use the time for the individual round to recover a little. Although I hate to admit it, it’s partly accidental that two seniors were killed just now.”</p>
 <p>The teacher creased his brows. These two fellows were very troublesome! Only after the Heavenfiend Douluo urged him for a lineup did he say helplessly, “Very well then. Even if we lose in the individual round, you can’t compete. At most, you can pair with Meng Hongchen in the 2-2-3 fight.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Xiao Hongchen agreed forthrightly. He also knew his own condition. He couldn’t recover so fast from the White Tiger’s Extermination attacks that were unleashed onto him. With some time from the individual round, he believed that he could regain a part of his true powers. With his sister around, he was sure he could achieve something in this final. It was definitely better than watching from below the stage.</p>
 <p>The Sun Moon team’s competing members and their sequence for the individual round were decided just like that.</p>
 <p>Ma Rulong had expended a lot of his powers earlier, and couldn’t be the first to compete. The first to be sent up was an official team member that had been substituted by Meng Hongchen and Xiao Hongchen earlier on. After that, it was another official team member that had been substituted. Following these two, it was Michael, Meng Hongchen, and Ma Rulong followed by Xiao Hongchen. There was a reason why Meng Hongchen was among the first few to be sent up.</p>
