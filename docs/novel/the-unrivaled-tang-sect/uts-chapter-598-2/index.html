 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “I am sorry, but I don’t think I can do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why can’t you do it? I don’t care. I want it too!” Ju Zi was practically shouting at Huo Yuhao. In fact, she was so loud that some of the soul engineers from the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion who were guarding the area turned around to make sure that their Marshal was okay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi waved her hand and told them that she was fine. She tried to slow her breathing as she looked at both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? Why are you not able to do it for me?” By now, her voice had softened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a gentle sigh before shaking his head. He did not go on to explain why as he looked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stood up and finished the grilled fish in her hand before explaining to Ju Zi, “The emotions were different. You need to stop making things difficult for him. He didn’t do it on purpose. He simply had different emotions when he was grilling the fish for us. Hence, the flavor will still be different, even though they were grilled in the same way. That’s why I was never overly concerned that he was grilling fish for you. Unless I’m willing to share my grilled fish for you, you will never be able to taste the flavor of love.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong walked towards Huo Yuhao before she leaned into his body. “The grilled fish was very delicious. I love you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was startled by her short, simple sentences. It was the first time that Tang Wutong had expressed her love towards Huo Yuhao in front of someone else. This was a pleasant surprise for him. Even though he knew that Tang Wutong was trying to piss Ju Zi off, he was certain that she meant every single word she had said to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I love you too,” Huo Yuhao said. His heart had already melted after hearing what she had just said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tears started to stream down Ju Zi’s face in an uncontrollable fashion as she watched them hug before her. She finally understood why Tang Wutong was willing to allow him to grill fish for her. She was neither trying to be kind, nor was she hungry. She had simply wanted to show her that she didn't stand a chance at wresting Huo Yuhao from her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She finally understood it was not that Tang Wutong was not jealous of her. In fact, Tang Wutong had always been jealous of her. She was trying to put her down in the strongest possible way. Even though Ju Zi knew that she needed to be strong in moments like this, she still couldn’t help but cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So what if I manage to conquer the entire continent? I have still lost to her. As long as he leaves his heart with her, I will never stand a chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her tears blurred her vision. Ju Zi turned around and wiped away the tears on her face. She covered her face with her visor before walking to the side silently. She started to walk away from them as she remained silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did I go overboard?” Tang Wutong snuggled against Huo Yuhao and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “It’s good that you’re trying to get her to give up on me. There’s already no chance that we can get together. Besides, I don’t want her to hold any more feelings for me. What you’ve done is correct. But I have to admit that Ju Zi is quite pitiful. You can tell that there is still kindness in her heart. She did not kill needlessly while she was conquering those cities. If not, I would have killed her despite our past relationship. "</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Past relationship?" Tang Wutong looked up immediately. She was alerted by Huo Yuhao's usage of such words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted his visor before he planted a kiss on her red lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It just so happened that Ju Zi had turned around at this very instant after reaching the riverbank. After seeing them kiss, she could not help but fly into a rage. She dashed towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong in a furious and mad manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was naturally able to sense her movement. After all, his powerful cultivation meant that he was able to sense most of the movement in his surroundings. He let go of Tang Wutong before turning around to look at Ju Zi. Following which, he released a gentle stream of soul power which formed a barrier that blocked Ju Zi from getting near them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi glared at Huo Yuhao with blood-red eyes and shouted, "Huo Yuhao, do you know how much I…"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that instant, the golden trident on Tang Wutong's forehead suddenly appeared before it emitted a golden ray of light that landed on Ju Zi's body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi trembled vigorously as she stumbled backward. It was almost as if she had discovered something extremely frightening. Her eyes widened in fear as she ended her sentence there and then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wutong, what did you just do?" Huo Yuhao was startled as he turned around to look at her. Based on his understanding of her, Huo Yuhao knew that she would never harm Ju Zi even if she was jealous of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh? I also have no idea what just happened." Tang Wutong was equally worried as she quickly stepped forward to support Ju Zi. "Ju Zi, are you alright? I really don't know what just happened."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao believed that Tang Wutong would never lie to him. Besides, her tone and emotional fluctuations did not seem to suggest that she was lying. But then, what was that golden light?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, their positions seemed to have been reversed. Ju Zi was now the composed one, while the other two were panicking over her. She shook her head and told Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, “I’m fine. I’m sorry for being so emotional. I just need to rest for a while.” Following which, she walked over to a big tree and sat down. Everything seemed to have become normal again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong turned around to look at one another. Neither of them had any idea what had just happened. However, now that they no longer were in the mood to get intimate with one another, they simply sat down and rested up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Ju Zi, who seemed to have returned to her usual calm state, was actually very confused. She was still trying to understand what had just happened to her. When that beam of golden light landed on her, she felt as if her entire body had been pinned down by a mountain. She also heard an immensely authoritative and frightening voice talk to her inside her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person with the mysterious voice said something that doused all the feelings of injustice and frustration within her heart. His words woke her up and left her with nothing but fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If you don't want me to destroy you and your child, you would better keep what you want to say to yourself."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the entire army burdening them, the soul engineer legions were able to move at top speed. Because the beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions were all capable of flight, they were able to fly for a good two hours with the help of milk bottles before they needed to land and rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, they were able to see Radiant City in just slightly more than a day's time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Ju Zi was flying with her human-shaped soul tool, she gazed at Radiant City, which lay before her. She knew that there was no room for failure. She must succeed in what she had planned to do. If she were to fail, there would be no turning back. Of course, she had prepared for the worst. Even if she were to fail, she would not lose everything. However, she knew well enough that her loved one would definitely die if she were to fail.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though she had already given up on him, and had understood that she had no hope of getting together with him, she was unable to give up her feelings for him! Hence, she was constantly being tormented by her feelings. However, Ju Zi knew that she had to focus on the task at hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She took in a deep breath and allowed the cold air to calm her nerves and emotions. She had to succeed. She could not fail, for her son, for herself, and for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be honest, conquering the entire continent had never been her priority. The most important thing for her was to control her own destiny. After commanding the army for so long, she definitely knew how the Sun Moon Empire's technological advantage would not disappear in just ten years. Hence, she was not anxious at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was very worried about her son. As her son continued to grow, it would soon be his turn to undergo the martial soul awakening ceremony. She had absolutely no idea what martial soul her son would inherit. Hence, she was really very scared for her son.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew she could not afford to wait any longer. This was the best chance she had to take charge of her own destiny.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao was also overwhelmed a wave of emotions. He could no longer remember how many times he had been to Radiant City. In fact, he had always left Radiant City with different impressions and feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was initially very impressed with how the city was set up. Now, he felt as if he could control and destroy the city if he really wanted to. This was a transformation that came about as he became stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the day, one could only rely on one's abilities. One could only truly become confident after becoming powerful. In addition, he now had someone he loved whom he could trust with his life. After their encounter with the two Ultimate Douluo, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had been training very hard, and were definitely improving faster than an average Transcendent Douluo could. In fact, Huo Yuhao believed that they would be able to reach Rank 98 earlier than he had previously projected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Radiant City, Xu Tianran, and the Holy Ghost Church, we are finally here. This time around, we must influence affairs from within the Sun Moon Empire. This is the only way we can fight for more time for the Star Luo Empire and Dou Ling Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was confident that both he and Tang Wutong would be able to become Ultimate Douluo by the time the war would start again in ten years’ time. Both of them would become the first Ultimate Douluo in history to possess three soul cores. Even though soul tools would still be immensely powerful, he believed that they would be able to influence some of the events within the continent with their superior abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the end of the day, Huo Yuhao did not believe that the three empires’ soul tool technology would be able to catch up with the Sun Moon Empire’s in these ten years. However, he felt that he would have a chance at deciding the outcome of the war once he had become sufficiently powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A faint light flickered across Huo Yuhao’s face as he flashed a smile.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran, let’s have a proper fight this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three soul engineer legions started to descend when they were about twenty-five kilometers away from Radiant City. After landing, they did not head towards Radiant City immediately. Instead, they stayed where they were and reorganized themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, it was common knowledge that flying above Radiant City was strictly forbidden. Unless they were given special permission by the Emperor, they would not be able to fly above the city. In fact, all of these returning troops had to be checked before they could enter Radiant City. Only military officers would be exempted from these checks. This was a rule everyone had to abide by.</span></p>
