Just what does he aim to accomplish? He’s really made things serious, won’t he have a tough time in the academy when this is all over?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi Mu said softly, “Keep your voice down. We’ll get into trouble if the others hear this. I think Yuhao is doing this on purpose. He just wants to study in the Illustrious Virtue Hall normally. The ordinary students won’t get chances to see him. Not to mention, he’s also an exchange student. If anything happens to him when he’s in the academy, the academy can’t account for it either. He’s doing this to humiliate the academy, and I don’t know why Hallmaster agreed to allow this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke glanced at him and asked, “Did you register too?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke twisted her lips and commented, “I didn’t know that you were so self-aware! Didn’t you work very hard over the past half year? Why aren’t you confident in yourself?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi Mu laughed and replied, “Confidence rises with one’s abilities. While I don’t want to expose too much of mine right now… I’ll beat him one day. But I can admit that I’m not his match at present. Although my improvement over the past half year has been significant, didn’t he increase his number of rings from three to four? While I don’t understand why a twin martial soul, soul master, is so strong, I know that I’m not his match. I simply need to work harder from now on. Is there news from Ju Zi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke shook her head and said, “No! Don’t think about her anymore. Didn’t she reject you before leaving?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zi Mu chortled. “It’s not that easy to forget someone you love. Moreover, you’ll always have a chance if you work hard enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ke Ke’s attention was drawn to the arena, and she said, “The competition is about to begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The commotion in the spectators’ stand didn’t seem to affect Huo Yuhao’s concentration. He didn’t even take a look at Xuan Ziwen’s displeased expression before moving to one side of the arena. He closed his eyes and waited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a soul master, he greatly desired to fight. When he was immersed in soul tool creation every day and was under a lot of pressure in the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, he had a strong urge to vent this built-up pressure. Today was the best opportunity for him to let loose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to win this competition and reap the great rewards to prepare for his future research in soul tools. The future of Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect was his greatest motivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was only fifteen years old, but he was shouldering a lot of responsibilities. He needed to vent his emotions. He also had another intention—help the Tang Sect gain momentum. Bei Bei had discussed this with Huo Yuhao a couple of times. They reckoned that the Tang Sect’s future development couldn’t be separated from soul tools. But, relying on Huo Yuhao and He Caitou wasn’t going to be enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where could one find plenty of talented soul engineers? The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering academy. Huo Yuhao wanted to leave a deep impression through this competition. At the very least, he wanted all the students to know about him, whether they liked him or not. Rather than being ignorant to his existence, their knowledge of him would be for the best. Furthermore, his arrogance actually contained a deeper meaning behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The first round is about to begin. Everyone, please remain silent and give both parties a peaceful competition’s atmosphere. Whoever makes noises will be punished according to the school’s rules and regulations.” Lin Jiayi’s stern voice reverberated all throughout the surroundings. This would help to contain the slightly messy situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s opponent was a youth, one who looked to be eighteen or nineteen years old. The badge on his chest revealed that he was a Class 5 soul engineer. However, he definitely seemed a little nervous now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Huo Yuhao’s previous actions had provoked the students from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, they also put a lot of pressure on the competing students. If they won, they would be treated as the heroes of the academy. But if they lost, they would become sinners! This was even more evident so for the first student to spar with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s Class 5 soul engineer, Xia Xuanchen.” The nervous youth reported his name as he looked at Huo Yuhao. The entire arena was now silent. Everyone’s attention was focused on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shrek. Tang Sect. Huo Yuhao.” Huo Yuhao said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Ziwen was unhappy when he looked at Huo Yuhao. He said in a deep voice, “This is just for sparring, a friendly competition. Both parties must try to avoid severely hurting each other during the process.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could sense Teacher Xuan staring at him and understood his intention. He nodded and replied, “Noted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Xuanchen also nodded. By now, he’d calmed down slightly, and slowly became excited. If he could defeat Huo Yuhao, would his class belle treat him nicer? Maybe he could even enter the Illustrious Virtue Hall directly. This was a great opportunity for him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Ziwen heaved a sigh of relief after receiving Huo Yuhao’s acknowledgement. He was afraid that Huo Yuhao would harm the academy’s students in this &nbsp;competition. A huge problem would arise if that happened. But, for now, it seemed like he had no such intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Both competitors, please approach the waiting areas.” Xuan Ziwen said loudly. The Soul Tool Experimentation Area had already been marked out yesterday. The waiting areas on both sides were separated by about a hundred and fifty meters. It was also a way for soul engineers to fully unleash their long-range capabilities. But, from what they’d agreed on earlier, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t use any soul tools apart from the Milk Bottle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Xuanchen turned around and walked away. He only felt his surging blood rushing through his veins. He couldn’t wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was different from him. He walked backwards and revealed a smirk of contempt. His first opponent really didn’t seem too impressive! Although they were just sparring, he was careless enough to show his opponent his back. He didn’t have any wariness towards his opponent. It seemed like Jing Hongchen was right, and organizing a sparring competition was necessary for these ordinary students from the academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Ziwen also noticed this problem. That was why when both parties reached their waiting areas, he immediately shouted, “Begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Xuanchen turned around frantically when he heard Xuan Ziwen’s sudden shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was anyone’s natural reaction. However, he wasted two seconds before he could fully turn around and ready his attack. Huo Yuhao burst forth like a panther in these two seconds. He leapt up, and seemed to be flying. When Xia Xuanchen finally reacted, the distance between the two of them had been reduced to a hundred meters already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xia Xuanchen displayed his abilities as an elite student of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy even though he was shocked. He lifted his arms and two metal barrels appeared, with metal clanging sounds ringing out. His metal barrels were different from ordinary soul tool cannons and soul rays. They completely covered his arms, giving off the feeling that he had lost his arms and grown soul cannons in their place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two different balls of light suddenly shot out. The left soul tool cannon fired a ball of yellow light, while the right fired a ball of red light. The speeds of the lights were also different, with the yellow light being markedly faster than the red. Before the lights were fired, a beep was heard from Xia Xuanchen’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual detection had already been activated back when they were preparing for the match. His greatest advantage in this sparring competition was that he was also a soul engineer, even though he was competing as a soul master. Thus, he was very familiar with them. However, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s soul engineers knew nothing about his fighting strategies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence Huo Yuhao could immediately recognized the different effects of the balls of light. The yellow light came from a Class 5 shock cannon; a domain-type offensive soul tool. When their shots exploded at a high velocity, they would cause intense shockwaves. Opponents who weren’t skilled enough could easily be torn apart by the shockwaves. Even if the opponent could resist them, his movements would be greatly stalled. It was a rather effective Class 5 soul tool, although it was very difficult to create.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The red light, on the other hand, came from the high-powered soul cannon on his other arm. It only had one effect—destroying the opponent. It would lock onto an opponent through the opponent’s soul power, allowing the cannon to track one’s opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The combination of the shock cannon and high-powered soul cannon was effective and powerful. Evidently, Xia Xuanchen had prepared well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While this combination was effective, Huo Yuhao had expected it. When the soul cannons were fired, Huo Yuhao suddenly changed directions. He moved in a diagonal direction now. It was impressive, and when the shock cannon fired out the ball of yellow light, Huo Yuhao was no longer within the area covered by it.</span></p>
