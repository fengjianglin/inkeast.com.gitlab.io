Since when was the White Tiger Duke able to use Instant Teleportation? Furthermore, there isn’t any known Instant Teleportation skill with that kind of range!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Instant Teleportation couldn’t teleport someone so far away, and neither did the White Tiger Duke possess such a skill. However, Huo Yuhao did. More accurately speaking, it was Xu Sanshi that possessed such a skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er had once taken Huo Yuhao to the Great Star Dou Forest to attain a strange soul skill. Huo Yuhao rarely used this soul skill. However, it was able to turn the tides every time it was used. This soul skill was called Duplication.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Huo Yuhao’s spiritual cultivation reached such a high level, his Duplication had limited effects. There were some powerful soul skills that he couldn’t duplicate. However, his spiritual power was at the concrete-material realm now! No matter how strong a martial soul was, he was able to duplicate all its soul skills. Of course, the strength of the soul skills he duplicated corresponded to his cultivation when he unleashed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before leaving Shrek City, he had found Xu Sanshi and duplicated Xu Sanshi’s evolved fourth soul skill, Xuanwu Displacement. From afar, his opponent or partner could be instantly shifted in front of him. It wasn’t just a displacement, it was more like a summoning. The skill should have been called Xuanwu Summoning instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Huo Yuhao used two soul skills at once. His first soul skill was his Instant Teleportation, a skill from his soul bone. Instantly, he crossed the fifty-meter gap between him and the Starsky Douluo and appeared behind him. He wasn’t restricted by distance when he unleashed his soul skills. However, such a distance was undoubtedly more suitable for the White Tiger Duke to launch an attack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he used his Instant Teleportation, he unleashed his Xuanwu Summoning. Both he and Dai Hao unexpectedly appeared behind the Starsky Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purplish-gold light flashed, and Huo Yuhao’s linked third soul skill also took effect. He didn’t open his Eye of Destiny earlier to control his aura, and right now, they didn’t have much time left, so he used his normal Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was important to note that Huo Yuhao already had a seven-ringed cultivation! Along with his immense spiritual power, his Spiritual Shock could even affect someone as strong as Ye Yulin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Ye Yulin demonstrated his strength as a Class 9 soul engineer. When Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock was about to reach him, a black headband suddenly shone on his forehead. On this headband was a silvery-white gem, which was crushed instantly. As he moved slightly, everything in front of him turned black. However, he wasn’t greatly hurt by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this momentary delay was still enough, because he was delayed just as Dai Hao was being teleported over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke was very experienced. While he was shocked by the fact that he was suddenly behind Ye Yulin, he still hated the Starsky Douluo greatly. How would he show any mercy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Streaks of blinding white light instantly shone behind Ye Yulin. It was the White Tiger Duke’s sixth soul skill, White Tiger’s Extermination. He unleashed it on the Starsky Douluo while he was in his Martial Soul True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Yulin couldn’t even turn around right now, but he still managed to smack his right hand against his chest, and something strange happened. Countless spots of golden light shone on his body. These golden lights were like stars in the night sky. When Dai Hao’s attack landed on Ye Yulin’s body, these spots of lights immediately joined together and formed a web. This web of light blocked Dai Hao’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Titled Douluo, Invincible Barriers didn’t have much effect anymore, because there was a limit to the class of an Invincible Barrier. The strongest Invincible Barrier that existed as of now was only Class 7, and could only able to resist one strike from an assault-type Titled Douluo. For someone of Ye Yulin’s standards, it didn’t offer much protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The protective soul tool that Ye Yulin owned and had just unleashed was called the Starsky Barrier. It was his strongest defensive soul tool at Class 9.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no soul engineers that weren’t concerned about their own defense. They knew about the gap between them and higher-tier soul masters in terms of physical strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the White Tiger Duke’s all-out attack collided with Ye Yulin’s Starsky Barrier, Ye Yulin exploited its momentum to unleash his soul thruster and widen the gap between him and Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao. However, he still groaned and spat out blood when he was struck. Huo Yuhao had a fantastic and rare opportunity in front of him. How could he possibly give it up? With the Starsky Douluo around, they practically had no chance to escape!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Ye Yulin’s Starsky Barrier lit up, Huo Yuhao had already started making his move. His Eye of Destiny opened, and a strange halo instantly landed on the Starsky Douluo’s body. The sixth soul ring of Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes shone. This rose-gold soul ring was covered in a magical glow. He had unleashed one of the two soul skills of this soul ring that Wang Qiu’er had given him, Spiritual Reaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, Ye Yulin felt a little dizzy. The headband that he had specially created to resist spiritual-type attacks didn’t have any reaction. One of the three silvery-white gems on his headband was already crushed, but the other two gems didn’t react at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indescribable sense of crisis turned Ye Yulin pale at this moment. His reaction was on point. The light from his flying-type soul tool and soul thruster were instantly extinguished. He even gave up his control of the two Sunmoon Divine Needles in the air. His body immediately crashed toward the ground, as if he were in freefall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spiritual Reaving, he followed it with an all-out strike of his Spiritual Shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom, boom!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two remaining gems on Ye Yulin’s forehead instantly blew apart. His headband, which was roughly as strong as a Class 8 soul tool, was completely destroyed at this moment. Not only that, but he also groaned as blood started flowing from his pores.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being struck by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Reaving, his defense against spiritual attacks became effectively useless! This was the most effective attack Huo Yuhao could use on powerful soul masters and soul engineers. Of course, the prerequisite had to be that his opponent wasn’t prepared for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao wanted to chase Ye Yulin, but he was immediately stopped by Huo Yuhao. “Quick, rise into the sky and take control of his Sunmoon Divine Needles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao immediately understood what he was trying to do. Following this, he felt a streak of spiritual power linking with him. Everything around him was presented mentally through Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, almost all the White Tiger bodyguards had successfully escaped. The last wave of bodyguards was entering the twelve black doors right now. Under such circumstances, their escape plan would be perfect as long as the two of them were able to flee successfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the guidance of Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power, the two of them quickly rose into the sky. As the Starsky Douluo’s spiritual sea had been hurt, and he was afraid that the White Tiger Duke would chase him, he was rapidly descending at this moment. It was too late for him to stop Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao. In addition, the rest of the soul engineers were still attacking in the direction Dai Hao was earlier. As they regained awareness, they only managed to relocate Dai Hao at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything happened too quickly. Seeing that Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao were rising into the sky, streaks of light shot towards the both of them. All the soul engineers believed that the two of them were trying to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distorted rays flashed around Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao. Huo Yuhao used his Spiritual Interference Domain. He had already demonstrated the strength of his Spiritual Interference Domain earlier. Not even a Titled Douluo could see through it. Suddenly, the rays weren’t able to lock onto them and struck nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Area of effect attack.” Ye Yulin managed to stabilize his body at this point and flew up once again. Right now, he looked very pale, but he was also very angry. He had been subjected to a sneak attack. Not only was a Class 8 soul tool destroyed, but he was also seriously hurt. At this moment, he was suffering from a splitting headache. If not for his Class 8 headband, he would be half-dead. He put on another soul tool that defended against spiritual power and flew up again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao and Dai Hao had a much greater head-start. As they flew at their quickest speed, they were already inching close to the two Sunmoon Divine Needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr">Dai Hao had used a Sunmoon Divine Needle before. Naturally, he knew how to control it, and immediately used his soul and spiritual power to complete his connection to one of the two<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap"> Sunmoon Divine Needles. Furthermore, the Sunmoon Divine Needle that he had used before was given to him by Huo Yuhao. While Huo Yuhao wasn’t strong enough to use this Class 9 soul tool in the past, he did research it before! Thus he wasn’t unfamiliar with its controls, either. The two of them quickly controlled the two Sunmoon Divine Needles. In addition, both these needles had been charged up by the Starsky Douluo earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ye Yulin, you can have a taste of the strength of your Sunmoon Divine Needles, too. We shall blow you apart!” Huo Yuhao shouted.</span></p>
