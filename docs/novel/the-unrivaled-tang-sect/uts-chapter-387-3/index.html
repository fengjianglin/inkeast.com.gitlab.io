She quickly rushed away back to Sunrise City.</span></p>

She died just like that. She died without unleashing any of the fighting strength that she should possess.</span></p>

The Fourth Elder was also flying back from afar. His eighth and ninth soul rings could be seen flashing.</span></p>

He had perfectly combined his spiritual and soul power through the connection of his emotions to form his three great skills, which were the strongest expression of his emotions. No matter how strong his opponents were, they would be infected by him if they weren’t able to resist the invasion of his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These three great skills were mainly supported by Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power because his spiritual cultivation had surpassed the rank of his soul power. When he completed his soul power fusion with Wang Qiu’er and unleashed his three great skills, he had already established himself in the league of the strongest individuals in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After unleashing his sword, Huo Yuhao was already crying. He retracted his palm to his waist before flipping it over. He formed the shape of a heart in the air, and all the lights were retracted at this instant. There was an additional heart at the center of his palm. It was a golden heart. Even the most dazzling gem in this world couldn’t compare to the glow from this golden heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This golden heart represented a sincere heart. It was filled with eternal love and remembrance.</span></p>

At this moment, there was only one figure in his mind. There weren’t any other people or things that could affect his state of mind. He was already deeply immersed in his thoughts of Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong’er, Dong’er, Dong’er!</span></p>

He seemed to see Wang Dong’er and how she had sacrificed her life for him without any hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong’er, Dong’er…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, the clouds experienced changes, and thunder rumbled. After pitch-darkness filled the sky, it suddenly lit up. The lights came from an unknown origin, but they formed a heart shape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The signals from all the aerial surveillance soul tools that the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion had released again were all jumbled up. In the next moment, their internal formation arrays blew apart, and they were all destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That huge and seemingly boundless heart resonated with the golden heart on Huo Yuhao’s palm.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er, I’ll forever miss and bless you. Even if I go to another world, as long as there’s still a trace of my spirit left, I’ll always love you, Dong’er!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao pushed his palm out, and the two hearts resonated with each other, it seemed as if countless flowing lights shone behind Huo Yuhao’s back. There were only memories of him and Wang Dong’er within those flowing lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Haodong Palm, a palm which would last eternally!</span></p>

The qi of heaven and earth was overwhelming, and the feeling of remembrance was pure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heart on Huo Yuhao’s palm enlarged severalfold, and completely engulfed him and Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two hearts between heaven and earth got closer and closer, and then merged together. At this moment, the Third and Fourth Elders had to retreat rapidly, even with their cultivations. They could clearly sense that they would be critically hurt if they were touched by this heart-shaped light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hearts combined in the sky, and formed a heart shape that was even brighter than the sun. It was perfectly flawless.</span></p>

In the next instant, this huge heart suddenly raised up a dazzling plume that shot into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, both Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er vanished without a trace.</span></p>

Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu, who were both restrained by the Third Elder’s Lightning God’s Binding earlier, had also disappeared. It was like the Third Elder’s Lightning God’s Binding was a joke in front of the Haodong Palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third and Fourth Elders were both in a daze.</span></p>

Among ordinary people, and even soul masters, they possessed rather extraordinary fighting strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, how many opponents did the two of them face? They had fought more than a hundred elite soul engineers, a Class 9 soul engineer, a Titled Douluo, and a Soul Douluo who was a strong, spiritual-type evil soul master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was the eventual result? The Soul Douluo was killed, the elite soul engineers fell from the sky, and were in critical condition, and the two Titled Douluo could only watch helplessly as they escaped. They couldn’t even stop them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one would believe this. All of this was too weird and shocking.</span></p>

It was frightening. I have a feeling that I would’ve been killed if he used all three moves on me earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder patted the Fourth Elder’s shoulder and said, “Forget it, he’s doomed no matter what abilities he has since he’s ignited his spiritual sea. Let’s go, too. We don’t know how the Holy Lady and the others are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, Huo Yuhao was doomed!</span></p>

Nan Qiuqiu, Nan Shuishui and Wang Qiu’er could clearly see Huo Yuhao’s face as they were protected by the heart-shaped light, but they couldn’t sense any resistance from the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above Huo Yuhao, that identical figure was still burning. However, it looked a little illusory now compared to before.</span></p>

For some reason, she had become extremely fragile now. She was like a glass vase that could be smashed into pieces any time. She no longer seemed strong, or possessed any fighting spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head gently and said, “No, Qiu’er. It’s not only her in my heart. You also exist in my heart. It’s just that I didn’t dare to admit it.”</span></p>

She had always been a resilient person, but her voice was trembling now. “I… exist in your heart?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded gently and pulled Wang Qiu’er in front of him. He gently embraced her and let her lean on his body.</span></p>

I just didn’t dare to admit it all this while. Perhaps I’m the reason why Dong’er is asleep, and why you are in such pain. If I had faced myself earlier, things might have been different. Humans are emotional creatures. I could tell that you were fond of me. When I found out that you plucked another Yearning Heartbroken Grass for me, my heart eventually still opened up for you. I tried to hide it and not face it, and keep all my love for Dong’er. However, I can’t deny its existence.</span></p>

I’m a bad person. I’ve hurt both you and Dong’er. If heaven gives me one more chance, I’ll only have two choices. Either I’ll choose to forsake the both of you, or I’ll think of a way to keep both of you by my side. I won’t let any of you go.”</span></p>

I’m actually very happy now. I really miss Dong’er. I really wish to return to see her. I’ve already planned everything out. After this mission is over, I’ll return to the Clear Sky Sect to see her. However, I’m afraid that I can’t go now. If you have the time, visit her on my behalf. If she wakes up, tell her that you are her elder sister, and that everything that happened was just a dream. Help her to forget me.”</span></p>

This was the first time Huo Yuhao had seen her so helpless after all this time that he had known her. However, there was a sense of bliss in her tears.</span></p>

However, you showed up at different periods of my life. It would have been better if only you or Dong’er existed! Qiu’er, I’m sorry…”</span></p>

I should be the one to apologize. I was the one who forced myself into your life. Without me, all of this might not have happened. In fact, I already knew what you thought earlier. I knew that you wanted to sacrifice yourself to save me. However, I still hated you and your heartlessness, until you told me that you have me in your heart. I can feel your sincerity. My love for you has finally been repaid.”</span></p>
