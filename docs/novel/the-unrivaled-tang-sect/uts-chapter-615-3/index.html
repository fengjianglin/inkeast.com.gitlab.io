 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, it was because of their involvement that the Dou Ling Empire fell so quickly. In the world of soul masters, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion was legendary. However, this legend was taken down right now. It was as if it had ceased to exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was all because of two people!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire had lost its strongest pillar. The fate of this fight was sealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was completely in a daze. Although she knew that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong would become terrifyingly strong if they returned, she was still comforted by the fact that she had the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion. At least the soul engineer legion shouldn’t have any problem resisting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, her hopes were dashed now. Resist? How could they? Without linked soul tools, how could they possibly resist two Ultimate Douluo? These two were even extraordinary Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How? How did you manage to reflect my light? It’s impossible! The strength of my Silvermoon Divine Light Ray has already transcended this world. It’s already close to the strength of gods!” Kong Deming was unconvinced. He was a little hysterical as he screamed at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked coldly at him, “This is because my ice mirror is at absolute zero!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Absolute zero?” Kong Deming was dazed. He had heard of such a concept, but didn’t it only exist in myths? Even Ultimate Ice couldn’t possibly reach such a temperature!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Forming an ice mirror at absolute zero before using it to reflect the ray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a little unconvinced as he asked again, “If you resist it directly, you can’t block it off even if you can reach absolute zero.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Childish!” Huo Yuhao snorted scornfully. “Why do I have to resist it directly? Don’t tell me you are willing to resist my all-out attack directly? You have three hundred people, but we only have two. Our small tactic was enough to down all of them. If you can unleash that sort of attack a hundred times, perhaps you can resist us. But for now, it’s over!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao looked into the sky. Tang Wutong, who was below him, also shone brightly with golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, two golden suns shone at the same time. They flashed alternately in the sky, turning the entire battlefield golden. Immense spiritual undulations engulfed the entire Sun Moon Empire army. Any slight movement was recorded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorrow!” Huo Yuhao called.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something strange happened. On the ground, all the soul tools in the soul formations started to melt. They turned into a golden metal fluid that spread on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The feeling of sorrow didn’t just affect people. It affected everything. This was the power of emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was simple sorrow, but the entire world shook because of this. The soul formations that had been constructed seemed to vanish instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked coldly at Ju Zi, “Now, you shouldn’t doubt my words, right? You should know that I can destroy your entire army. Return all the territories that the Sun Moon Empire has invaded and scram back to the Sun Moon Empire. If you do that, I’ll spare their lives. Otherwise, prepare to witness their deaths.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi turned pale. When she saw the White Tiger Duke, who had already retreated far away, she knew that she probably wouldn’t be able to avenge her parents’ deaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All her sacrifices and hard work over the years was wasted just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, no, no! I want to take revenge. I want to take revenge!” Ju Zi raged at Huo Yuhao. “That’s right, you can kill all of us. So what if you can? I’ve already given the order. If the Sun Moon Empire’s army is taken down here, the troops stationed in all the cities of the three empires will start a massacre of the civilians in those cities. We’ll kill as many as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are brilliant! However, can you save the entire continent? Can you? Thousands and thousands of people will have died because of you. If you kill millions from the Sun Moon Empire, I’ll kill even more from the three empires. They’ll die with us. If you don’t let me take revenge, I’ll vent all my anger and hatred on the entire continent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Ju Zi’s hysterical words, Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only one whose expression changed significantly. The people from Shrek Academy, Star Luo City, the Dou Ling Empire and the Heavenly Soul Empire were also all shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Ju Zi really did that, the entire continent would be stained with blood! How terrifying would that be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a disaster was unimaginable. At least, no one here was willing to imagine it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was furious. “What are you talking about? Will you dare to do that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi glared at him coldly. “I can do anything for revenge. Don’t think you’ve won. Hand the White Tiger Duke over. As long as I kill him, I’ll recall my troops. Star Luo City can remain. I won’t attack the city as long as you are alive. I’ve already gained control of the entire continent. I can do whatever I want. No matter how strong you are, you can’t save the entire continent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was already pale-green by now. That’s right, he had managed to reverse the situation with his and Tang Wutong’s immense abilities. Even though there were millions in front of him now, they were just cannon fodder to the two of them. However, Ju Zi was right. The Sun Moon Empire controlled most of the continent. Given this, Huo Yuhao might be able to protect a few cities if she ordered a genocide. However, he wouldn’t be able to protect the entire continent! It couldn’t happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju Zi!” Huo Yuhao shouted coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi looked up and glared coldly back at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a figure flew out from Huo Yuhao’s back and came beside him. It was the White Tiger Duke, Dai Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If she wants to kill me, let her do it. As long as I can protect the countless lives on the continent, what’s my life worth?” Dai Hao said. Right now, there was a comforted look in his eyes. As the Marshal, he had never expected someone to be able to change the entire course of a battle with his individual ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he saw hope in Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. He saw hope for the Star Luo Empire. He still recalled Huo Yuhao once telling him that he was from the Star Luo Empire. Since this was the case, the Star Luo Empire had a future!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the future, how could the empire not restore its glory under Huo Yuhao’s leadership? Ju Zi was very big with her words. She wanted to massacre everyone on the continent, but she might not be able to do it. Once he was dead, she might lack the motivation to do it too. Didn’t she just want revenge? She could kill him. For the future of the empire and for the continent, he believed that his death was worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No.” Huo Yuhao shouted and grabbed the White Tiger Duke by the shoulder. He refused to let him fly over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, Huo Yuhao’s gaze turned deeper. His spiritual undulations engulfed the entire Sun Moon Empire army. After this, there seemed to be something else appearing in his eyes. He appeared to struggle a little, but soon made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ju Zi, don’t blame me since you’re so brazen.” Huo Yuhao snorted coldly. He swept his right hand in front of his body. A streak of silver light flashed across the sky and revealed a silver door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was stunned. When she looked into his eyes, an indescribable fear surfaced in her heart. This was because she immediately knew what he was up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, don’t!”Ju Zi shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao’s hand was already in the door. At the next moment, a boy who looked like he was six or seven appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This boy’s appearance was very sudden. However, the soldiers of the Sun Moon Empire were very astonished now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This boy was also lost. He looked at Huo Yuhao before looking at his mother. He appeared confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still managed to remain calm. He was puzzled as he looked at Huo Yuhao. “Who are you? Why did you grab me?” His train of thought was very clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao, you must not hurt him. No, no!” Ju Zi’s persistence was broken because of this boy. She was almost on the verge of crying as she screamed at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked coldly at her, “If you can kill all life on the continent, why can’t I do the same? I don’t wish to use a boy to threaten you. However, don’t blame me if you’re using the entire continent to threaten me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he pulled the boy into his embrace. The boy’s face was very close to Huo Yuhao. He was in a daze, but he wasn’t afraid. He even stretched out his hand to touch Huo Yuhao’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao dodged, but the boy still managed to touch him.</span></p>
