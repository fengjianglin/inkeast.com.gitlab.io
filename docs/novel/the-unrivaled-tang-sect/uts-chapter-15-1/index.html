 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 15.1: Three Months</strong></p>
 <p>The red-shirted woman was precisely the fire-type Soul Emperor that had nearly brought a calamity upon Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. If she really was as old as she looked, her talent had already reached a level that couldn’t be described with the words ‘extremely startling’ anymore.</p>
 <p>Throughout the entire history of the Douluo Continent, even when the first soul masters had appeared, a twenty-year-old Soul Emperor could rank amongst the top in terms of talent; so much so that they could even be compared to Shrek Academy’s first generation Shrek’s Seven Monsters.</p>
 <p>The aged voice belonged to the white-clothed elder who’d brought her back. When she heard his question, the red-shirted girl, who was named Xiaotao, blankly shook her head. “I don’t remember anything except for a patch of red appearing in front of me. After that, I felt something life-threatening. I tried to resist, but after that, I woke up here....”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder furrowed his brow and walked up to her. He spoke in a low voice, “Why didn’t you tell me that you couldn’t suppress the evil fire within your body? Aren’t you aware that you almost caused a calamity? Two students from the outer courtyard almost died to your evil fire.”</p>
 <p>Xiaotao was dazed. “I... I didn’t know that it would be this serious. I thought that I could control it. But….”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder let out a long sigh before saying, “The longer you suppress it, the stronger it’ll be when it erupts. Xiaotao, from now on, postpone your cultivation. Even if you’re the most outstanding genius Shrek Academy has had in the past several hundred years, you can’t destroy yourself for the sake of the school. If the evil fire destroys your consciousness in the future, your teacher will regret it for the rest of his life.”</p>
 <p>Xiaotao stubbornly replied, “No, teacher. I want to cultivate. I guarantee that it won’t happen again in the future. I can even feel that the evilness and heat from the evil fire have been suppressed. There definitely won’t be any problems in the near future. It’s just… what kind of power was actually able to suppress my Evil Phoenix Fire?”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder spoke with a thoughtful tone, “It’s an extreme, peak-level ice-type energy. Its purity far exceeds that of your Evil Phoenix Fire, and somewhat resembles the Absolute Frost Breath of the Ancient Ice Dragons. It’s completely suppressed the Evil Phoenix Fire’s effects on your body—far more than any of the methods we’ve used.”</p>
 <p>Xiaotao asked with a doubtful tone, “However, it’s simply impossible for it to be an Ancient Ice Dragon! Much less in our academy! Could it be someone who’s infiltrated the academy?”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder shook his head and said, “I’ve already sent some people to investigate. I originally thought that it might have been some people from their families who’d been sent to protect them, but after I investigated them, I discovered that that was impossible. They’re called Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao is a special student from the Tang Sect, so I asked Bei Bei about him. He and Tang Ya met him in the Great Star Dou Forest, then brought him back with them. His talent is ordinary; he’s even an orphan. There’s no way that an expert would follow him around and protect him. On the other hand, Wang Dong has quite a large background. However, his background isn’t specialised in ice-type martial souls. As for the academy itself, I’ve asked around several times. There are many students and teachers with ice-type martial souls, but a peak-level ice-type martial soul like this has never been spotted amongst any of them before. It’s truly strange.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Tao replied, “Teacher, forget about it. You don’t need to continue investigating it.”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder spoke, “This matter concerns your future, how could I not be worried? If I can at least find the person who possesses this ice-type martial soul, and if he turns out to be male, I’ll let you be a couple with him. That way, you’ll be able to neutralise the negative effects brought about by the Evil Phoenix Fire within your body. That’s the only way that you can truly soar into the heavens in the future. However right now, you’re completely restricted. Not only has your cultivation speed decreased, even your life’s at risk.”</p>
 <p>Xiaotao’s charming face went red. “I don’t want to get married, much less to a person I don’t like for the sake of his martial soul!”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder sighed. “The problem is, your evil fire can’t be restrained!”</p>
 <p>Xiaotao humphed and replied, “I’ll restrain it. I don’t want to marry anyone!”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder said angrily, “Ma Xiaotao, if you continue to be this unruly, I won’t recognise you as a disciple anymore.”</p>
 <p>When Ma Xiaotao saw that the white-clothed elder was angry, she immediately began to behave. She proceeded to speak in an aggrieved tone, “But, teacher I….”</p>
 <p>The white-clothed elder rubbed her head. “Foolish girl. Your emotions can be cultivated, but you only have one life to live, let alone how much talent you have. No matter what, teacher will make sure that you find a good partner.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Nannan, I brought some roasted fish from that kid from yesterday. Don’t worry, I didn’t use any violent methods to obtain it. I queued up and bought it.” Xu Sanshi spoke with a polite tone as he stood in front of Jiang Nannan, who’d planned to walk to the canteen.</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan shook her head, “No need, thank you.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi probingly asked, “Do you think I was too violent yesterday? Actually, I’m not normally like that. It’s just that, because of you, I… Nannan, I know that you still hold a grudge against me because of what happened that time. But, couldn’t our reunion at Shrek Academy be considered a sort of destiny? I really like you! I promise to be faithful to you until I die.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan coldly replied, “I remember telling you that we’d take what we needed, then walk our separate ways after meeting that time. There’s no chance that anything will happen between the two of us. Xu Sanshi, you’re a high and lofty noble, why do you have to bother a little woman like me? I can’t even give you anything. Please don’t interfere with my life in the future. If you continue, I’ll report it to the school. Also, please don’t bully other students because of me.”</p>
 <p>When she finished speaking, she turned around to walk away. However, she was blocked by Xu Sanshi, who angrily said, “Me, bully other students? Don’t you know how badly that Bei Bei bullied me? The person roasting fish yesterday was his junior brother, which he then used as an excuse to swindle me out of two Mysterious Water Pills! Tang Ya even shot a Dragon Beard Needle into my waist, thus I have a huge bruise there now! Just what’s wrong with me? You’re not even willing to give me a chance.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan coldly replied, “You went to a place like that at such a young age, so what’s can be so ‘good’ about you?” When she finished speaking, she turned around and left. This time, she directly jumped up, her three yellow soul rings immediately lighting up. Her ears seemed to faintly elongate and prick up, while her body appeared to become even more slender. She pushed off the ground with her legs, and appeared ten metres away, before rapidly running away without turning back.</p>
 <p>As he gazed at her shrinking back, Xu Sanshi fell into a daze for a while. Afterwards, he fiercely bit off some of the roasted fish that he was holding. “Xu Sanshi, you’re such a loser. What’s so amazing about this? I’ll eat it myself. Eh? This roasted fish tastes quite delicious.”</p>
