 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 21.3: Fusion of the Three Innate Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p>Wang Dong didn’t have the time to be angry with Huo Yuhao, as he was also aware of the trouble they had gotten themselves into. Thus, he ran alongside Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>The two didn’t have time to eat breakfast, nor did they have the time to shower. Instead, they quickly ran towards the teaching blocks. They were extremely clear about Zhou Yi’s temper; was there any difference between being late for class and committing suicide?</p>
 <p>Their appearances were truly somewhat wretched. Wang Dong was still fine. At the very least, he had still managed to straighten his clothes when he’d kicked Huo Yuhao earlier. Huo Yuhao, on the other hand, was in an even more sorry situation. His school shirt was half tucked into his pants. Not only that, his hair was also messy, and two of his shirt buttons were unbuttoned, exposing his bronze chest. As he ran, the wind blew his clothes around.</p>
 <p>However, they didn’t have the time to worry about that. Right now, all they wanted to do was to rush to the classroom with the utmost haste and extinguish the flames of Zhou Yi’s anger; they were already late!</p>
 <p>After a minute, they arrived at Class One’s entrance.</p>
 <p>“Reporting in.” Huo Yuhao shouted out, full of energy.</p>
 <p>“Reporting in.” Wang Dong’s voice was softer than his, so much so that it seemed like he didn’t have any energy at all. He stole a glance at Huo Yuhao, a somewhat complicated expression in his eyes. Then, he ruthlessly raised his hand and pinched Huo Yuhao’s back.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s expression immediately changed, but seeing that Zhou Yi had already walked over to them, he forcefully held in the scream that almost left his mouth.</p>
 <p>The other students were already present. Seeing Huo Yuhao’s sloppy appearance, a smile unexpectedly flashed through Zhou Yi’s eyes. However, the always meticulous Huo Yuhao didn’t manage to notice it as a result of the severe pain from his back.</p>
 <p>“You two, what happened? Come in first.” Zhou Yi waved over to the two.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong hurriedly walked into the class, and Wang Dong even shut the door considerately.</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao, who had already arrived earlier, couldn’t help but widen her eyes as she saw their wretched appearances. Her mouth moved, but she didn’t say anything. It looked as if she was asking, “Heavens! What were the two of you doing last night?”</p>
 <p>The gazes of the entire class were focused on the two, especially on the monitor whose clothes were untidy.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi used her ever-cold voice to ask, “My dear class monitor, tell me. What were you two doing?”</p>
 <p>“Uh… sorry, Teacher Zhou. We overslept.” Huo Yuhao replied with an embarrassed look on his face. Now, all they could do was to take the initiative to apologize for their mistakes. Furthermore, they could only receive whatever punishment Zhou Yi gave them without complaining.</p>
 <p>“Who slept with who? You actually managed to oversleep?” Zhou Yi made a rare joke.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was stunned, while Wang Dong’s face instantly reddened. This was because she’d hit upon the truth.</p>
 <p>The whole class continued to remain silent, but this silence only lasted for three seconds. Right after that, the class burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong lowered his head, wishing he could find a whole to jump into. This was embarrassing, simply too embarrassing! Having just noticed Huo Yuhao’s untidy clothes, he just wanted to slap him to death! <em>This bastard, he made me lose all my face.</em></p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, Zhou Yi smiled as well. Although the smile on her face looked even uglier than someone crying, Huo Yuhao was certain, certain that she was smiling.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi raised her hand, and her authority as a super-teacher undoubtedly manifested itself, causing the entire class to quieten immediately. However, Zhou Yi ignored the smiling expressions in their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Enough. Return to your seats.” Zhou Yi waved her hands, forgiving the two in a completely unprecedented manner.</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong subconsciously raised their heads, thinking they had heard wrongly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi glared at them, “What? You’ve overslept to the point where you don’t know what I’m saying?”</p>
 <p>Only then did Huo Yuhao understand what she had said. Pulling Wang Dong’s sleeve, the two gloomily walked over to their usual seats. However, they didn’t feel like raising their heads after feeling the surrounding looks of ridicule.</p>
 <p>However, it was fortunate that they were still freshmen, where everyone was only eleven or twelve-year-old students. They only treated the issue of two people sleeping together as a joke; they didn’t think too much of it. But if this reached the ears of the outer courtyard’s upperclassmen, and was distorted by the words of a few fujoshis, it could become an even bigger scandal.</p>
 <p>After walking back to the teaching podium, Zhou Yi indifferently said, “After three days, the freshmen assessment has finally ended. The final results were already tallied last night.”</p>
 <p>After hearing her words, the students of Class 1 were filled with energy; not every group was as absolutely confident they had passed the assessment like Huo Yuhao’s group.</p>
 <p>A smile that nobody dared to compliment unexpectedly appeared on Zhou Yi’s face for the second time today. “I have no choice but to admit that you’ve worked very hard. You’ve given me face. Out of our twenty-two teams from Class 1, all of you have passed the freshmen assessment. I’m very happy about this.”</p>
 <p>“Bang——” The entire class was filled with boiling excitement; cheering sounds filled every corner of the classroom. This time, Zhou Yi didn’t stop them. She smiled as she watched the excited cheering of the kids in front of her.</p>
 <p>They truly had the qualifications to start cheering! Last night, all of the proctors as well as the teachers in charge of the ten classes had worked together to tally the results of the assessment.</p>
 <p>Practically all the proctors stated that the students from Class 1 were much more resilient than the students from the other classes. During the intensive assessment competition, they had all displayed a frightening amount of willpower and combat strength; out of all the classes, they were the class that had turned the tides the most times during the assessment. Most outstandingly, the students from Class 1 practically won all the matches that involved opponents who were evenly matched with them.</p>
 <p>Ever since she had become a teacher at Shrek Academy, this was the first time Zhou Yi had received public praise. Originally, the students in Class 1 had been the fewest in number among the ten classes. But after the round-robin tournament, over half of the students who had participated in the assessment had been eliminated. As a result of this, Class 1 was now the class who had the greatest number of students in Year 1.</p>
 <p>No matter how strict Zhou Yi was, everyone was feeling very happy today. This was also the main reason why Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had been forgiven even though they had turned up late to class.</p>
 <p>“Okay, quiet down.” After letting the class cheer for a long time, Zhou Yi motioned for them to quiet down.</p>
 <p>“The only way for you to guarantee that you’ll stay in the academy is to pass the assessment. At the very least, you won’t be easily eliminated for another year. However, it’s only one more year. If you become lazy in the future, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to continue seeing you after your second year here. Furthermore, it’s not such a big deal to be able to pass the freshmen assessment. Out of the twenty-two teams here, fourteen teams haven’t finished their freshman assessment yet, because you’ve entered the top 64. You’ll still have to go through the knock-out competition, which is where you can truly prove how outstanding you are.”</p>
