 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong laughed as she dodged away. “Have you forgotten how much it hurts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately pulled a long face. “My dear, you have to ask your father to come when we go back this time and remove his seal. Otherwise, I’m going to go crazy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong giggled. “I think it’s pretty good this way. You’ll just have a slight taste of it. Isn’t it always wonderful to have something to look forward to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao put on a depressed face and said, “You are beautiful. I have been too stifled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong blushed as she said, “Hurry up and cultivate. All you know to do is speak frivolous things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two people sat opposite each other in a tent not far from them. It was the Body Douluo, Du Busi, and the Heavenly Sun Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Du, are we really going to listen to that little fellow’s commands along the way?” The Heavenly Sun Douluo asked Du Busi with a little displeasure in his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi nodded and said, “Don’t underestimate that little kid, Heavenly Sun. He’s surprised me more than once already, and he has a spiritual-type martial soul. He has very unique abilities concerning concealment. Our operation is about to begin, are you a little nervous? Otherwise, why are you so flustered?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo sighed and said, “It’s not possible that I’m not even a little nervous. Looking at the Heavenly Soul Empire’s situation, I’m truly worried about the Dou Ling Empire! The Dou Ling Empire’s national strength is inferior to the Heavenly Soul Empire. Once the war starts again, if the Heavenly Soul Empire cannot hold our enemies back, we will fall as well. Therefore, our operation needs to happen. However, I don’t trust that little fellow who’s just a little older than twenty. He’s too young. If we are exposed before we even enter Radiant City, then we don’t have a chance at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi said plainly, “That’s why I said you’re being nervous. Have you not paid attention to that youngster’s aura? Can you tell what his cultivation rank is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo was momentarily surprised. “He probably has around seven soul rings. I felt their soul power undulations before this, and they’re both around seven soul rings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Body Douluo, Du Busi shook his head and said, “No, you will realize after closer scrutiny that their true strengths are very unlike what they appear on the surface. Their soul power undulations of a seven-ringed soul master are fake. That kid’s spiritual power is extremely strong, and even I was almost fooled. However, I realized upon closer inspection that his spiritual power is deep and vast like the ocean. I cannot tell what his true cultivation is, but it’s definitely not at seven rings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo didn’t really believe him. “He’s only a little more than twenty. Even if he’s from Shrek Academy, seven soul rings is already quite impressive.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi answered, “You can inspect him a little more closely tomorrow. What I’m sure of is that if we wish to enter the Sun Moon Empire without leaving any tracks, letting the little fellow command us should have the best effect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, we’ll just let him command us.” The Heavenly Sun Douluo was evidently a little fearful of Du Busi, and he didn’t continue discussing the problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is the news from Radiant City reliable, Brother Du?” The Heavenly Sun Douluo lowered his voice and asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi nodded and said, “We have already confirmed our intel. They are my elite disciples, and there should be no problem with their info. After you succeed, you have to escape immediately. You don’t have to worry about me because I have people providing support on the inside. Safety won’t be a problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone gathered once more in the White Tiger Duke’s command tent after breakfast in the morning on the second day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was still holding Tang Wutong’s hand, and that wasn’t just to display how intimate they were with each other. He also wanted to keep them in their strongest condition, but they were the only ones who knew that, of course.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke lowered his voice and said, “Everyone, this operation is extremely important. It is related to the direction in which the war will proceed in the future. But please remember, everyone, that you are the cornerstones of your respective empires, and if our mission is unsuccessful, you have to ensure your own safety. We still have hope as long as you guys are around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke’s words were heavy, but very sentimental and sincere. Everyone’s expressions changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Body Douluo, Du Busi heaved a sigh and said, “I didn’t think that we’d end up like this. There was once a time when I had absolute faith that we could keep our enemies beyond our walls, but it now seems like that’s just laughable. We have been living in a cave, and that has caused us to lag too far behind. We can only give our all on this mission. No matter what, we have to succeed. We appreciate your thoughts, Duke, but if we don’t put our lives on the line for this mission, then we have almost no chance of success. We have to give everything we have for our countries, no matter what. Alright, let’s move out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi’s status in the world of soul masters was very impressive; he was on the same level as Shrek Academy’s elder Xuan. The White Tiger Duke, Dai Hao was just a junior in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful along the way. Good luck, everyone, and Godspeed. May you return with success.” Dai Hao took a step back as he spoke, and bowed solemnly at everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi turned towards everyone and surveyed them before he took the first stride out from the commander’s tent. The Heavenly Sun Douluo followed closely behind, and the rest of the Titled Douluo walked out after him. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong walked at the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi didn’t continue walking forward when he left the tent. Instead, his eyes fell on Huo Yuhao and said, “From now on, kid, we will all listen to your commands before we enter Radiant City. Don’t worry, nobody will give you any trouble along the way, since I’m the one that’s saying this. Everyone will listen to you, and that includes me. Now, what do we do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi’s words were extremely overbearing and dominant. Only a person with his cultivation and his status in the world of soul masters could convince the other fourteen Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stared at the mighty Body Douluo in surprise. He didn’t expect that Du Busi would be so supportive of him, as he knew that the Body Douluo had had some run-ins with his teacher back in the day. It seemed like he had left everything behind because his nation was in danger. He should have understood many things after the serious injury that he had sustained the last time around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi was so supportive, and Huo Yuhao naturally had something to show for it. He hurriedly bowed in Du Busi’s direction and said, “Thank you for your trust, sir. I can’t say that I’ll command everyone, but I hope that we can all safely enter the Sun Moon Empire’s territory. Afterwards, I will use some methods to help everyone conceal yourselves. Therefore, I hope that everyone can listen to what I say along the way. I will be most confident that way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Du Busi smiled plainly and said, “You don’t have to be polite. Give us something real.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao knew that if he couldn’t display some of his abilities right now, these Titled Douluo wouldn’t be so compliant. Everyone respected strength in the world of soul masters. That had been the way ten thousand years ago, and was still the way ten thousand years later today. Even though Huo Yuhao was already a Class 9 soul engineer, he was still willing to call himself a soul master. Perhaps that was because he hailed from Shrek Academy as a soul master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes glowed, and golden light flickered faintly at the bottom of his eyes, while gentle spiritual undulations emanated soundlessly. These undulations enveloped all sixteen Titled Douluos, including Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of these Titled Douluo detected his spiritual power, and only when Huo Yuhao shared his Spiritual Detection and entered their spiritual world did they realize what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single one of the Titled Douluo from the three native empires, including Du Busi, changed their expressions in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they realized that spiritual power had entered their own spiritual worlds, they attempted to push back against it. A soul master’s spiritual sea was the core of their control over their own spirit. How could they just let someone enter?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the Star Luo Empire’s Titled Douluo, who had experienced Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection before, didn’t resist at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But whether they were resisting or not didn’t matter, as Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection completed the fusion very easily. That also meant that resistance was futile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Detection was like a large gauze, and all the Titled Douluo’s spiritual power was like water that rushed through the gauze. All that spiritual power couldn’t stop it from moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Titled Douluo from the Star Luo Empire, who were relatively more familiar with Huo Yuhao, didn’t think his Spiritual Detection was so magical. Huo Yuhao just directly connected their spiritual power, and they didn’t need to do anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world around them became completely three-dimensional in the next moment, and three-dimensional images from three hundred and sixty degrees around them immediately appeared in the Titled Douluo’s minds. They felt like they had an eye looking down from the sky, and everything became much clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo and the other soul masters from the Dou Ling Empire were most unfamiliar with Huo Yuhao, and when they felt how mystical Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was, looks of astonishment appeared on their faces.</span></p>

The three-dimensional images three hundred and sixty degrees around them immediately expanded once they were connected, and began webbing out towards the distance. Everyone was just standing where they were, but their vision was beginning to stretch far into the distance, and it didn’t take long before large masses of the Ming Dou Mountain Range were within their sight.</span></p>

Have your eyes awakened for the second time, kid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was momentarily taken aback before he shook his head and said, “I don’t know if my eyes have awakened for the second time, but my martial soul has mutated before.”</span></p>

If only we’d met a little earlier, I would have been willing to take you as my last disciple so that Mu En fellow didn’t have it easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned a little when he heard Du Busi addressing his teacher respectfully. Du Busi was incredibly sharp, and immediately saw the displeasure in his eyes. He smiled plainly and said, “You don’t have to be unhappy. Even if Mu En were still alive, I could still address him like that. My big brother wouldn’t be dead if not for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint dash of deep and profound emotions circled in his eyes.</span></p>
