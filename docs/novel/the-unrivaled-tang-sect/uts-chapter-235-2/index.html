 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor would produce a mighty impact every time it appeared, and it was so strong and terrifying that Wang Qiu’er was starting to lose her balance. Her six soul rings sparkled continuously as she amplified herself, and she tried to retaliate forcefully with her Golden Dragon Spear. The fight became increasingly tiring for her, and if not for the fact that the Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor was afraid of the Golden Dragon Spear’s frightening draconic majesty, she would have probably fallen a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The female bear’s situation was even more dire. She lashed out ferociously with her razor-sharp claws, but she couldn’t fend off the two incredibly formidable beast souls. She was weakened from the start, and she had also taken a hit from the stationary soul cannon shell, so she was far from her peak condition. Dark golden fur flew into the sky as wounds that went down to the bone appeared on her body continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They can’t hold on for much longer!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao called out in his mind. He could see with Spiritual Detection that the battle on the other side was still ongoing. The male Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear beast soul was exceptionally powerful, and it could still launch its own menacing attacks despite being outnumbered and besieged. Cai Mei’er was a Titled Douluo, but she had to be a little more reserved in her battle in the interest of her students’ safety. They were weakening it continuously, but they would still need a while longer before they could hurry over, while Wang Qiu’er’s situation had become urgently perilous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How can I save her?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Thoughts and ideas spun in Huo Yuhao’s head as he raced to find a solution. They were three eight-ringed evil soul masters, and he had no chance if he fought them face-to-face. He could just continue hiding himself like he was, but the three brothers would proceed to the other battlefield once they took care of Wang Qiu’er and the female bear. Huo Yuhao would then be safe and he could rendezvous with his companions. However, this thought never once occurred to him, and he never considered deserting his companion, even though he had only met Wang Qiu’er a few times before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Wang Qiu’er collided once more with the Ghostshadow Leopard Emperor’s sudden attack. She wasn’t able to maintain her balance this time, and fell off the female bear’s back, while her Golden Dragon Spear stabbed into the air at nothing at all. She was immediately in extreme danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The female bear’s enormous body was covering her as Wang Qiu’er’s eyes suddenly sparkled with strange light. Right when she was in immense peril, she swung her Golden Dragon Spear horizontally as she grabbed the fur on the female bear’s back. An intense hostility erupted from her body, and a formless aura surged into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The female bear seemed to have been acutely provoked in some way, and she knocked the Scarletgolden Lion and the Netherworld Ghost Tiger away with two continuous paw swipes, while her body seemed to swell a little. Berserk! This was the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s frightening soul skill. But her body was already extremely weak at this point, so how could she maximize and unleash this soul skill’s true power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was still grabbing onto her fur with her right hand, while circle after circle of golden light expanded outward like spinning tops. A dash of grief flickered in her eyes, and she muttered, “I will avenge you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bear released intense dark golden light, and these colors flowed through Wang Qiu’er’s palm and into her body…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, both Wang Qiu’er and the three brothers suddenly felt as if the weather had turned cold, and an exceedingly sharp aura erupted without warning in the next second.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er, the three brothers, the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear, and the three beast souls that were locked in a bitter fight all developed palpitations in the moment when this razor-sharp aura emerged. This felt a frightening pressure from a superior being, as if both heaven and earth were about to collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This chill didn’t just appear in the air, it surfaced in their hearts. That petrifying chilly feeling, along with that boundless majestic intimidation, immediately made everyone on the battlefield feel a horrifying, surging pressure from the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reactions of the three brothers were very quick. They immediately responded when they realized something was wrong, and they called their origin soul beasts back at the first possible moment. What was more important than protecting themselves?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sky turned dark and gloomy without warning in the next moment, and a strong gust of wind swept across the earth as countless snowflakes danced through the sky, while everyone’s vision became extremely blurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying blizzard instantly caused the temperature to plummet, and the Great Star Dou Forest’s landscape seemed to have transformed completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three brothers’ eyes flowed with suspicion and uncertainty. Their main powers as evil soul masters originated from their beast souls, and they had slain innumerable soul beasts during their lives. They were also exceptionally sensitive towards soul beasts’ auras.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They could clearly feel that this terrifying pressure came from a soul beast. However, they had never seen such a mighty and formidable ice-type soul beast within the Great Star Dou Forest in all their days. This place wasn’t the Extreme North! Still, this aura of Ultimate Ice and snow told them that they were in the presence of a soul beast that was ranked among the Ten Great Savage Beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three brothers were initially separated, and they realized in the next moment that they were lost. What astounded them even more was that they couldn’t even feel each other’s presence anymore. The ice and snow had sealed off their powerful senses, and the snowflakes sliced against their bodies constantly like sharp blades, attempting to tear them into pieces. This Ultimate ice and frost was starting to consume their soul power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The radiance on Wang Qiu’er’s right hand receded the moment this flurry of ice and snow appeared, and she felt a spiritual connection in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’s him!</span></p>

This person tugged on her hand and whispered, “Let’s go. Quickly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Empress’ Chill of the Snow Empress’ Three Ultimate Techniques fused with his own Domain of Perpetual Ice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t just release the domain’s power, he Imitated the Snow Empress’ aura as well. He relied on the domain’s concealment to swiftly come to Wang Qiu’er’s side. How could he just watch Wang Qiu’er meet her demise?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice’s area of effect wasn’t that large. However, arresting his opponents’ senses within the domain was the most important thing to Huo Yuhao at this moment. However, he was clear that the three brothers wouldn’t be controlled like this for long, and they would soar into the sky when they realized that they couldn’t find their way around inside the domain. The domain’s strength would gradually decline the further up they went until the point where it vanished, so Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er didn’t have much time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er glanced at the female Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear as if she couldn’t bear to leave her behind. Her eyes sparkled as she soared into the air, and Huo Yuhao reacted with astonishment as her Golden Dragon Spear shone with brilliant golden light before it drilled right through the back of the female bear’s brain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The female bear fell to the ground in the next moment, and large patches of dark golden light immediately surged through the Golden Dragon Spear and into Wang Qiu’er’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Huo Yuhao truly experienced Wang Qiu’er’s formidable strength at this moment. The girl dragged him along when she leapt into the air, not burdened by his weight at all. That strength gave Huo Yuhao a feeling that he had no chance of fighting against it at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er muttered coldly, “I would rather she die at my hands than end up in those three bastards’ hands and become a tortured soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go.” Huo Yuhao tugged on her once more. They used the domain as cover as they briskly proceeded towards the others from Shrek Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao suddenly paused in his tracks at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three brothers were controlled for a far shorter time than he had thought they would be. They had already soared into the sky, and they now flew directly towards a location that Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er would definitely pass on their way back to meet up with the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hesitated momentarily before he pulled Wang Qiu’er in the other direction. He couldn’t shift the domain according to his own movements at this moment; he could only maintain the domain at its original location. He pulled Wang Qiu’er as he raced out of the domain and they began to run for their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Over there!” Someone shouted, and Huo Yuhao immediately felt his breath shorten as he could feel a terrifying aura behind him. It was clear that they had been discovered, it was exceedingly difficult to run away from the grasp of a group of Soul Douluo!</span></p>

The Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice was originally intended for him to meet up with Wang Qiu’er before anything else.</span></p>

The heavy cannon that had left a deep and lasting impression in Zhong Lidi and Zhong Liren’s minds appeared once more, and a horrifying bluish-purple light erupted while Huo Yuhao was sent hurtling backward by the incredibly powerful recoil.</span></p>

His body crashed into Wang Qiu’er as he was sent flying backwards. Wang Qiu’er subconsciously hugged him around the waist as they were blown backwards at breakneck speed, while the terrifying Class 7 stationary soul cannon shell flew directly towards the brothers who were pursuing them.</span></p>

Fan Yu had favored Huo Yuhao, and he had seen Huo Yuhao’s potential for the Soul Tool Department back then. His Spiritual Detection combined with stationary soul cannons unleashed their fearsome power once more.</span></p>

It gave the three evil Soul Douluo the feeling that they had walked right into the cannon shell. Explosions shook the forest, and even Soul Duoluo couldn’t just disregard a Class 7 stationary soul cannon’s might. Huo Yuhao took this opportunity and dragged Wang Qiu’er along as they disappeared into the forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
