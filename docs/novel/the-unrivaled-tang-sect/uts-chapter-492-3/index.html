 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he observed the Sun Moon Empire’s military base, he also unleashed his Spiritual Detection Sharing. Wei Na only felt that everything in front of her had brightened, and the pitch-black night sky had all of a sudden become clear. The image in front of her was quickly enlarged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She shook slightly in astonishment.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is a godly skill! At least, it is during surveillance. If our empire had such a talented soul master, we wouldn’t have been defeated so badly...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire had finally realized the importance of surveillance after paying the price of losing two-thirds of its land following the appearance of a new generation of soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of fighting strength, the Heavenly Soul Empire wasn’t so inferior to the Sun Moon Empire that they were invaded and battered so easily. The Heavenly Soul Empire also lacked greatly in their surveillance capabilities, not just in soul tools. From the start until the end, the Heavenly Soul Empire was the passive one, and didn’t even know when the enemy would appear, or how much strength they possessed. This was why they had lost so badly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Wei Na was in shock, Huo Yuhao had already carefully observed the setup of the Sun Moon Empire’s base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had fought the Sun Moon Empire’s armies quite a number of times. As a result, he could roughly tell what their setup was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, his expression turned grim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he had to describe their base, it would be ‘impenetrable’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire base was shaped like a long snake. However, it wasn’t completely horizontal. Rather, it was built in such a way that it fit the geographical structure of the land. More importantly, Huo Yuhao discovered five soul formations in the base. Each of these soul formations could only be built by an entire soul engineer legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant that the Sun Moon Empire had five soul engineer legions here. Without mentioning the number of soul engineer legions in the Hand that Protects the Nation that were here, five soul engineer legions were already sufficient to ensure that they were well-protected. If a full-blown conflict happened here, they would be extremely destructive. The Sun Moon Empire hadn’t gotten to starting one yet, probably because they had been greatly drained in their previous fights, and needed time to recuperate and regroup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Huo Yuhao saw was also seen by Princess Wei Na. She had some understanding of the Sun Moon Empire’s army. Through this surveillance, she also got a clearer look at things that she wasn’t aware of before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed slightly and said, “Five soul formations. Even an Ultimate Douluo would find it difficult to breach their base. Your Highness, how many soul engineer legions from the Hand that Protects the Nation are here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Na replied, “Two. One is the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion, and the other is the Terrorclaw Soul Engineer Legion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart sank once again. Among the five soul engineer legions in the Hand that Protects the Nation, the strongest was undoubtedly the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion. The remaining four beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions had differences in their abilities. Among them, the strongest was the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion, followed by the Terrorclaw Soul Engineer Legion and the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. The weakest was the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion and Terrorclaw Soul Engineer Legion were both here. This represented more than half the strength of the four beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions. No wonder the Heavenly Soul Empire found things so difficult here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, this is all we can see from such an altitude. We have to return.” Huo Yuhao said to Wei Na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, if he were the only one, he would carry out a series of surveillance passes. He might even go lower, or use his Spiritual Detection. However, he couldn’t do that with Princess Wei Na around. He had to ensure her safety!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao felt an omen. This omen didn’t come from his Spiritual Detection or soul power undulations. It came from his Three-Eyed Golden Lion skull. It was the warning given to him by his power of destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not right!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He subconsciously looked down, and discovered that one of the soul formations below was shining with red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit!” Huo Yuhao shouted. Following this, he grabbed Wei Na’s flying-type soul tool with both his hands and spun around in the sky, flinging her away with all his strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By the time she reacted, her body was already flung like a cannon shell. Huo Yuhao quickly rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By tossing her away, Huo Yuhao had already wasted some valuable time that he could have used to flee. It would be very difficult to avoid the enemy’s attack now. He could only rise further into the sky. The higher the altitude, the weaker soul power was. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao even used his Instant Teleportation to go higher up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he finished this, a beam of red light shot into the sky. It blazed through four thousand meters of sky and engulfed Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This beam of red light was more than a hundred meters wide. Although it only flashed once before disappearing, its aura was overwhelming, and made it seem as if the entire sky had been pierced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wei Na saw the red light sweeping past in the distance before Huo Yuhao was engulfed by it, she opened her mouth in shock, and was completely stunned in place. At an altitude of four thousand meters, without Huo Yuhao’s help, she only barely managed to keep herself up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before she reacted even further, Huo Yuhao’s voice suddenly sounded in her head. “What are you waiting for?! Why aren’t you leaving?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this, a black figure flashed past and grabbed her. As Huo Yuhao unleashed his Imitation once again, he quickly fled into the distance at his quickest possible speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, that red light only struck once before it eventually dimmed and disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, are you okay?” Princess Wei Na only reacted now. Although she didn’t know what that red light was, she at least knew that it wasn’t fireworks. How strong did it have to be if it could travel four thousand meters into the sky? If not for Huo Yuhao, she would have been dead by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Wei Na didn’t see was that pitch-black scales were slowly fading away on Huo Yuhao’s body, while his clothes had already been torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Huo Yuhao truly knew how terrifying that strike was after experiencing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, he knew exactly where it came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had come from linked offensive soul tools. It had to be!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao was completely astonished. That red light was high-energy and high-heat. The instantaneous surge of temperature sparked by that red light even melted his Ice Emperor Armor. Huo Yuhao had even unleashed a Class 6 Invincible Barrier, but it was vaporized, too. Eventually, he had used Di Tian’s reverse scale to protect his body. However, his clothes weren’t that fortunate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao clearly knew that he would have been critically hurt even if he didn’t die, if not for Di Tian’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was pertinent to note that the red light only struck him after travelling four thousand meters up into the sky! If it was closer, it would have been even more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the same attack didn’t come again. The Sun Moon Empire’s base also appeared to be very peaceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao brought Princess Wei Na all the way until they were above Heaven Dou City before they landed. When Princess Wei Na could control her own flying again, Huo Yuhao retrieved a new set of clothes to wear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a real scare!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s hair was still standing on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the two of them landed, Huo Yuhao saw that Princess Wei Na was very pale. He wasn’t faring much better, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was still scared out of her wits, Princess Wei Na couldn’t help but ask, “Yuhao, what was that attack earlier? How did the Sun Moon Empire discover us and lock onto our position?” Understanding the Sun Moon Empire’s setup was very important to the Heavenly Soul Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “If I’m not wrong, that attack should have come from linked offensive soul tools. This means that one of the soul engineer legions locked onto us, and a linked attack was fired from their soul formation. Although it was weakened as it progressed through the air, it was still very strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure how they locked onto us. However, it had to be through a surveillance soul tool. It seems like the Sun Moon Empire has made new progress in terms of ground-based surveillance soul tools. They’re actually able to see four thousand meters into the air.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Princess Wei Na couldn’t help but turn gloomy. Originally, the gap between the Heavenly Soul Empire and Sun Moon Empire was already very great. If this gap was widened further, wouldn’t that signify destruction for the Heavenly Soul Empire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tried to comfort her upon seeing her expression. “Your Highness, don’t be too worried. If I’m not wrong, the Sun Moon Empire’s ground-based surveillance soul tools can’t produce a wide effect even if they detect to a further distance. They can’t sweep the sky. We must have triggered one of their ground-based surveillance soul tools accidentally. Otherwise, the attacks should have come in waves. We weren’t attacked after the first strike. They must have lost track of us.”</span></p>

I know the difference between us and the Sun Moon Empire. I’m sorry I dragged you down. If not for me, you wouldn’t have been hit by that beam of light.” She was smart. She clearly knew what had happened earlier. If Huo Yuhao hadn’t bothered with her and just fled, he would have been able to escape the attack.</span></p>

Let’s not talk about this anymore. However, I’m afraid they’ll tighten their defenses after this incident. I’m afraid I can’t bring you along the next time.”</span></p>
