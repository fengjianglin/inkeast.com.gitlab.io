 <p><strong>Book 3: Fusion of Martial Souls</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 20.3: The Body Soul's Secret</strong></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao placed a finger to his lips. “Keep your voice down, lest other people find out about this. I’ve just told you my biggest secret.”</p>
 <p>From a certain standpoint, Huo Yuhao wasn’t lying. Of course, that wasn’t the entire truth, because in all honesty, a matter like the Skydream Iceworm would be too shocking. Now that he’d found a suitable explanation for his Spirit Shock, Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh of relief. He knew that he’d still have to face many different examinations along with his studies in Shrek Academy, and in order to face these examinations, he absolutely couldn’t afford to conceal his Spirit Shock. Even so, he’d have to find an explanation for it sooner or later, and the theory that he’d just given to Wang Dong seemed to be rather suitable.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong had a look of shock on his face as he looked at Huo Yuhao. “A body soul is actually so awesome? It can even spontaneously evolve and create a skill.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao scratched his head and said, “This isn’t anything special. Your Radiant Butterfly Goddess naturally possesses the ability to fly, right? The altitude of your flight will also increase as your cultivation increases. This kind of innate ability ought to be considered as your martial soul’s natural characteristic.”</p>
 <p>After pondering what Huo Yuhao had said for a moment, Wang Dong replied, “Nope, it’s not the same. You’re right, the innate ability of my Radiant Butterfly Goddess is flying. But that spiritual attack of yours isn’t an innate ability, since it appeared through the evolution of the Purple Demon Eyes. Meaning, your Spirit Eyes has the natural ability to evolve as a mutating body soul. This is something that my Radiant Butterfly Goddess can never compare to. Maybe some other kind of skill will emerge in the future when the Purple Demon Eyes evolve again.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao chuckled sheepishly and said, “Actually, it’s not any kind of skill either. A more accurate interpretation should be that the Spirit Eyes is continuously increasing my spiritual force. On the other hand, I found a use for it after releasing my spiritual force through my Spirit Eyes with the assistance of the Purple Demon Eyes.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong nodded and said, “I understand what you mean when you put it this way. It’s just like how I purify or compress my soul power to attack and defend. The only difference between mine and yours is that your spiritual force is formless, so it’s even more difficult to detect it when you use it. I never thought that there would be such a clever way to use soul power.”</p>
 <p>When the doubts in his heart had been answered, there was a somewhat relieved expression in Wang Dong’s beautifully big eyes. However, he quickly became extremely excited again. “Yuhao, the martial soul fusion skill that those twins used was really powerful. I’m afraid that we would’ve lost today even if we’d had three soul rings! Even though a fusion skill can’t last long, it’s still immensely powerful, and has an extremely powerful explosive force. It can be said to be the top-ranked skill for us Soul Masters. Their soul power is going to get even stronger in the future, right? If they can sustain their fusion skill for an even longer period of time, then it will definitely be extremely difficult for anyone of the same rank to contend against them. It’d be good if we could also have this kind of skill.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao burst into laughter and said, “Stop dreaming, how could such a good thing happen to us? I still recall that teacher said that the compatibility of one’s martial souls needs to be extremely high before it will be possible for a martial soul fusion skill to appear. The possibility of it happening is so slim that not even a single one will appear among thousands. If and when two people’s martial souls are highly compatible, there will be a reaction between both parties. We’ve lived together for three months already, yet have you had any feelings of compatibility with me before? In any case, I haven’t felt anything.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t expect Wang Dong to lower his head as he spoke, as though he was mulling over something. Moreover, his face had become slightly flushed.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Huo Yuhao asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong seemed to have made up his mind when he raised his head. There was a somewhat strange look in his eyes as he looked attentively at Huo Yuhao, and began to speak in a serious tone. “Since you’ve told me the secret of your body soul, then it’s not right if I conceal the truth any longer. The truth is, I’ve always been concealing my ability, as well as my aura, to some extent.”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” It was Huo Yuhao’s turn to be surprised. Wang Dong’s strength spoke for itself. He’d already amply displayed the strength of his martial soul—the Radiant Butterfly Goddess—during the freshman examination. Wang Dong had only used his second soul skill once during the ten matches, but even then, no one had been able to see what exactly it had looked like. Yet, he was now saying that he actually still had a concealed ability. How could Huo Yuhao not be shocked at this?</p>
 <p>Wang Dong continued, “Although you cannot sense the aura on me, when I received that Spiritual Detection Sharing of yours for the first time, I could already feel that your aura was extremely close to mine. The reason that my aura doesn’t extend outwards beyond the scope of my body is because it’s restricted by another power of mine. You’ll only be able to sense the existence of my aura with close bodily contact. Do you want to try it out?”</p>
 <p>“Close bodily contact? How do you want to get close?” Huo Yuhao asked in a dim-witted manner.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong suddenly became exasperated. “Stupid, isn’t it fine to just hug each other for awhile?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “Is that so! You should’ve just said so. Do I need to undress?”</p>
 <p>“No!” Wang Dong gave Huo Yuhao a shock.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao laughed and said, “Then come on.” He willingly spread his arms out wide as he spoke, walking towards Wang Dong for a hug.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong, on the other hand, was slightly dazed when he saw Huo Yuhao getting closer and closer to him. He didn’t have Huo Yuhao’s willingness, which in turn caused his body to unconsciously tense up. His whole being seemed to have entered an especially rigid state.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao hugged Wang Dong in a very natural manner. From his point of view, it was a hug between friends. Wasn’t this very normal? But, when he really hugged Wang Dong, the feeling changed slightly.</p>
 <p>He suddenly remembered that this was the first time that they’d been so intimately in contact with one another, making him suddenly recall the time when he’d seen Wang Dong’s figure from behind once more.</p>
 <p>He’d originally thought that Wang Dong’s body would be as muscular and sturdy as his. After all, they were both Soul Masters who painstakingly trained their bodies and cultivated their soul power everyday.</p>
 <p>However, when he hugged Wang Dong, it was completely different from what he’d imagined. Even though Wang Dong’s body was elastic to the touch, it was also extremely soft; the kind of softness that made him feel as though he had no bones. Moreover, he also had a faint fragrant smell on him. They were about the same height, so when Huo Yuhao hugged Wang Dong, his face was to the side of Wang Dong’s neck. When his chin rubbed against Wang Dong’s slender neck, the smooth and sleek feeling made his mind tremble slightly.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao really wanted to let out a sigh, but he felt that something was wrong. However, at his age, his knowledge in certain areas was still insubstantial, and thus he didn’t think too much of it. He only felt that hugging Wang Dong was much more comfortable than he’d imagined it would be.</p>
 <p>“How does it feel?” Wang Dong practically mumbled. He didn’t put his hand on Huo Yuhao’s back and hug him the same way; rather, he only let Huo Yuhao hug him. The feeling that he had was also different from what Huo Yuhao felt. Huo Yuhao’s body was very sturdy, and he also had a heavily masculine scent that was accompanied by the faint scent of sweat that youngsters had. Such an experience made Wang Dong blush deeply.</p>
 <p>“It’s pretty good. Very comfortable.” Huo Yuhao subconsciously answered, based on what he felt.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong went blank for a moment, but his expression immediately became one of anger after a moment. “Stupid, did I let you hug me so that you could feel comfortable? I was letting you feel the aura of my martial soul!”</p>
