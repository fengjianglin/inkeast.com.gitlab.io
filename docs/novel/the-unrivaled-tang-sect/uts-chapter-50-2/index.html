 <p><strong>Book 8: Advancing to the Second Year</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 50.2: Ancestor Tang San...</strong></p>
 <p>Of all the of students in the class, Wang Dong was the person who had to face the least amount of pressure. He was extremely familiar with Huo Yuhao, and the two of them were able to fuse their martial souls! It didn’t matter what ability Huo Yuhao used, he wouldn’t feel too great of a threat from any of them. When he heard Wang Yan’s words, he couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher Wang, then what color are God-ranked soul ring?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan replied, “Even I don’t truly know. Based on historical documents, the ninth soul ring of Ancestor Tang San’s Bluesilver Emperor was bluish-gold. His second martial soul—the Clear Sky Hammer—also had a different colored ninth soul ring; it was dark-gold. It’s very possible that it was also a God-ranked soul ring. Based on this, we can deduce that God-ranked soul rings will all have different, unique appearances.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong asked, “Didn’t you just say that one’s tenth soul ring would be a God-ranked one? How was Ancestor Tang San’s ninth soul ring able to become a God-ranked one?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan smiled slightly. “We’ll first have to talk about a legendary soul beast that once existed on our Douluo Continent. Even among the teachers within the academy, only a few of them know about this secret. This legendary soul beast was known as the Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor, and its cultivation had supposedly neared the million-year rank. However, nobody is clear as to whether or not it actually surpassed a million years of cultivation. According to our historical documents, however, once Ancestor Tang San absorbed its soul ring, it fused with some sort of energy in his body, which caused it to become a dark-gold God-ranked soul ring. Ancestor Tang San had already broken through the pinnacle of cultivation at this point, meaning that his soul power had reached Rank 100 and that he’d become a God. Only with the help of his main martial soul’s tenth soul ring—the Bluesilver Emperor—was he able to kill the Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor.”</p>
 <p>When Wang Yan finished speaking about Ancestor Tang San’s God-ranked soul ring, Huo Yuhao was left in a daze. After hearing about the possibility of a million-year soul beast who might have appeared in the past, he was stunned speechless.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he couldn’t help but ask, “Teacher Wang, did the Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor really reach a million years of cultivation?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan shook his head. “What really happened is more complicated. According to the large amount of research conducted over tens of thousands of years by powerful soul masters, a soul beast is normally limited to a hundred thousand years of life. When they hit this limit, they’ll encounter a calamity of sorts, at which point they’ll have to choose between attempting to break through this limit, or transforming into a human. Earlier, I said that soul beasts able to break through this limit are known as transcendent soul beasts. However, all of them will still have to face a calamity like this every hundred thousand years. Once they break through ten calamities, they’ll become existences close to that of a God. If they can leap through the golden gate and transform from a carp to a dragon, they’ll be able to become true Gods. As far as I know, however, a soul beast has never been able to complete this step. Even the Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor wasn’t an exception. As such, regardless of whether or not it was able to reach a million years of cultivation, it would still only remain a transcendent soul beast so long as it wasn’t able to become a God. Of course, only a God can force these terrifying transcendent soul beasts to surrender. If one doesn’t have as much as power as someone like Ancestor Tang San, even someone with the ability to kill a transcendent soul beast like the Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor wouldn’t be able to completely absorb its soul ring and soul bone.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao asked, “Teacher Wang. Before Ancestor Tang San became a God and left our world, did he have any other martial souls than his Bluesilver Emperor and his Clear Sky Hammer?”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan shook his head. “There shouldn’t have been any more. When Ancestor Tang San had his last battle with the Martial Soul Hall, the two opponents he faced were both God-ranked experts. According to the historical documents at least, a situation in which Ancestor Tang San possessed three martial souls didn’t appear. Yuhao, why would you ask something like this?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao scratched his head. “I was just casually asking something random. The God rank is simply too far away from us, thus I was just wondering whether or not we’d obtain a third martial soul if we reached the God rank.”</p>
 <p>Wang Yan smiled slightly. “Your train of thought is very good. Our research into the field of martial souls is precisely because we want to explore more of their secrets. One should definitely make bold hypotheses and verify them carefully. Alright, let’s stop for now.”</p>
 <p>His last sentence was directed towards Huo Yuhao. The other students instantly felt their bodies loosen up, which immediately causing the soul power in their bodies to undulate intensely, and in turn caused them to feel and incredible sense of relaxation. Only then did they recall the the pressure that Huo Yuhao had been releasing since he’d imitated the aura of a ten thousand year soul ring.</p>
 <p>When Wang Yan saw the students act as if they’d been relieved of a large burden, he smiled slightly. “The menacing aura that a soul beast emits and the pressure that a soul master emits are actually just two different types of intimidation of your spirit. As long as your spiritual power is stable enough, you’ll be able to stand unmoving like a reef near the seaside no matter how intense the pressure is. Earlier, your minds were captivated by my story, thus you completely forgot about the pressure Yuhao was emitting. Head back and have a good rest. Afterwards, prepare yourselves as best as you can for the advancement test. We’ll end class here. Tomorrow, we’ll continue to train in the same way.”</p>
 <p>Every single student within the classroom—including Huo Yuhao—had resolute looks in their eyes as they looked towards Wang Yan. Indeed, Zhou Yi couldn’t compare to a scholarly teacher such as Wang Yan when it came to theoretical knowledge. However, Zhou Yi was much better than him at controlling her students. Since they were both simultaneously in charge of the class, they even complimented each other. At the very least, Class 1 no longer had a single student under the two-ringed rank after the past year’s worth of study.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there was still a period of time before dinnertime. As such, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong decided to head directly towards their dorm. At Huo Yuhao’s strong behest, they began to cultivating as soon as they arrived.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao wasn’t truly trying to be hardworking today, however, he had a few questions for the Skydream Iceworm. The only way he could have a conversation with the Skydream Iceworm currently was by entering a state of cultivation with Wang Dong and calming down.</p>
 <p>As the Haodong Power circulated through their bodies, the dense undulations of soul power they emitted strengthened at a rapid rate. Both of them had experienced a qualitative leap in their cultivations during their vacation, thus the advantage they had in terms of cultivation speed since they’d fused their soul power was becoming more and more distinct.</p>
 <p>“Brother Skydream, Brother Skydream.” Once he’d entered a meditative state, Huo Yuhao immediately began to circulate his soul power in a controlled manner while calling out to the Skydream Iceworm.</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm responded to him quite quickly. Its lazy voice rang out, “What’re you doing? Is this about that Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Yeah! Brother Skydream, was that Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor really a million year soul beast?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm smiled mischievously. “Don’t you already have an answer to this?”</p>
 <p>Yes, the reason that Huo Yuhao had asked Wang Yan if Ancestor Tang San had had a third martial soul was precisely to verify whether or not the Deep Sea Devilwhale Emperor was a million year soul ring.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Since you’ve answered me like this, it truly wasn’t one?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm replied, “I’ve already told you: I’m the only soul beast on the continent who’s been able to break through to the million year rank. The moment I broke through the boundary of the million year rank, I felt something deep in my heart. It’s impossible to describe what that feeling was, but I instinctively knew that I was the first soul beast to reach this level. There hasn’t been anyone else able to. The number of soul beasts that reside in the ocean outnumber the soul beasts on the continent, thus it isn’t surprising for powerful soul beasts to appear there. However, I can guarantee that there are no million year soul beasts among their ranks.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Brother Skydream then, then… shouldn’t you be a God?” He still had an enormous amount of doubt within his heart. Once he’d obtained his second soul ring for his Spirit Eyes, he’d immediately discovered a secret. The Skydream Iceworm had always disguised the true color of his Spirit Eyes’ first soul ring. Lazy as he was however, the Skydream Iceworm had immediately delegated this task to Huo Yuhao once he’d obtained the ability to conceal his abilities. In truth, the first soul ring that the Skydream Iceworm had given him—his intelligent soul ring—was an impressive gold color. It was completely different from the regular white, yellow, purple, black, and red colored soul rings. When Teacher Wang Yan had talked about Ancestor Tang San’s God-ranked soul ring, a thought had immediately popped into Huo Yuhao’s mind. Wasn’t the first soul ring of his Spirit Eyes a God-ranked soul ring as well?</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm unhappily replied, “Stop dreaming. If I’d truly become a God, would I really have been bullied by those fellas in the Great Star Dou Forest? True, the soul ring that I gave you has the foundations of a God-ranked soul ring, but it absolutely isn’t one. It’s currently lacking two things: One, it needs a Godly Imprint that belongs to you. Only when you’ve obtain the cultivation of a God and have branded it with your imprint will it truly become a God-ranked soul ring. The other thing you require is a Godly Seat. Do you really think that it’s so easy to become a God? It’s definitely impossible to succeed without experiencing innumerable trials. However, it’s still too early for you to be thinking about these things. All you need to know is that this Brother is a unique and genuine million year soul ring in the truest sense of the word. Understood?”</p>
 <p>“Oh,” Huo Yuhao replied, “Brother Skydream, don’t go back to sleep yet. I still have another question to ask you. Earlier today, I used one of the soul skills that the Ice Empress gave me. Why was I suddenly so enormously powerful?”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm immediately flew into a rage, “Aren’t you just full of crap now! Who do you think the Ice Empress is?! She’s one of the most powerful soul beasts who currently exists. You’ve received her soul ring and soul bone, and even though you only absorbed a very small amount of her power, your physique was strengthened by an enormous amount. Furthermore, the two soul skills that she gave you are both power-type skills. These two things—her terrifying amount of power and her Ultimate Ice attribute—culminated into the soul skill you released earlier: The Ice Empress’ Pincer. However, you have to remember that the Ice Empress’ Pincer can only be utilised at its maximum in a close-combat situation. On the other hand, you have to try your best not use the two skills her torso bone gave you. They simply require too much soul power; you wouldn’t be able to endure it. Oh, right. When you’ve fused your soul power with this little fella in front of you, you should be able to barely release a trace of the power those two skills possess. In reality, you should feel proud of yourself. The person who tested you just now is one of those people you humans call a ‘Titled Douluo’.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was astonished. “Brother Skydream, you’re saying that Teacher Gong is a…”</p>
