Didn’t you display everything yesterday because you wanted all of us to know? Go and wash up, I’ll be waiting for you on the first level. Elder Xuan called a conference specifically for you today. All the elders of the Sea God’s Pavilion will be there. Think about how you’re going to introduce Spirit to them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao suddenly remembered. He’d been too focused on Wang Dong’er last night, and forgot this matter from before. Now, he was immediately jolted awake and acknowledged Yan Shaozhe’s words. He quickly went to wash up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe smiled and shook his head as he looked at Huo Yuhao. However, he didn’t hide the blatant look of admiration on his face. He seemed to have been reminded of something. He sighed, then he turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After washing up, Huo Yuhao couldn’t be bothered to eat breakfast, and quickly rushed down. Just like Yan Shaozhe had said, both sides of the long table were now seated with elders. With Elder Xuan sitting in the main seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since Elder Xuan became the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion, he had stopped acting so sloppily. He was now dressed simply, and his hair was properly combed. There was a gentle, smiling light in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Apologies, elders, for making all of you wait.” Huo Yuhao rushed over and lowered his head in guilt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan smiled and said, “It should’ve been a good night for you. You and Dong’er are finally together, but we didn’t sleep well last night. We were played with like little kids that don’t know anything about this world. You should know that you’re a part of us now after special permission was granted to you. You broke the age record to be a part of the Sea God’s Pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Elder Xuan mentioning Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er, the elders all started to smile. Huo Yuhao lifted his head up at this moment and saw Teacher Fan Yu and Zhang Lexuan, as well as a few familiar elders. As they saw him looking over, they nodded to acknowledge him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The vice-dean of the Soul Tool Department, Qian Duoduo, laughed. “Huo Yuhao, come over here. Sit beside me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he pointed to an empty seat next to him, and even shot Yan Shaozhe a provocative look.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao rushed beside Qian Duoduo and sat down. Zhang Lexuan was opposite to him. The two of them were seated close to the main seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan said, “Shaozhe, host the conference. Let Yuhao settle down first. I don’t think he can explain clearly given how anxious he looks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Yan Shaozhe acknowledged his words respectfully and replied, “Elders, we called for this conference today because of Huo Yuhao’s unprecedented orange soul rings and the special abilities he demonstrated yesterday. At the same time, there are some things we need all of you to decide together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe repeated a list of important matters to tend to. After a simple discussion, the elders made their decisions. The conference was proceeding very smoothly and efficiently thus far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still a little flustered at this point, as he was technically considered of equal standing to these various elders. Fortunately, he was spiritually strong. After a short period of tension, he finally calmed down and forgot all about Wang Dong’er temporarily. He thought about what he wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuhao, are you ready? Can you introduce your special soul rings to us now?” After they finalized the other matters he had addressed earlier, Yan Shaozhe turned his attention to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stood up immediately and said, “Dean Yan, Elder Xuan and elders, let me demonstrate my abilities to all of you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood up from his seat and came to a spacious spot to one side of the long table. With but a thought, the Snow Lady crawled out from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she looked at everyone in front of her, her beautiful, deep blue eyes blinked. She wasn’t afraid of strangers, but was slightly curious as she lifted her hand to point in Elder Xuan’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was stunned and quickly tried to stop her from pointing. He was afraid that she would harm Elder Xuan. After all, she was very unpredictable. Even Uncle Tai Tan was once taken advantage of by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I call her the Snow Lady. My orange-gold soul rings came from her. If we have to categorize her kind, I call her Spirit. She’s a special existence that’s independent of soul rings, soul bones and martial souls.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s first sentence immediately attracted the attention of the elders. As they looked at the Snow Lady from such a close distance, the elders started to reveal benevolent looks in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for a moment, Huo Yuhao said, “Talking about Spirits, I need to start from the beginning. That’s because this is related to a secret that I’ve kept for a long time. That’s why I’ve never told anyone about it in the past. Only Elder Mu knew a little, but he didn’t know the full story either. To tell the truth, there was another teacher in my spiritual sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said this, he shocked everyone present. While the elders weren’t young, their curiosity was greater than most youths. This was especially because there was hardly anything in this world that could arouse it anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao decided to develop Spirits, he knew that he couldn’t conceal the secret regarding Electrolux anymore. Otherwise, he couldn’t recount everything in enough detail or explain the history of his seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Before I entered the academy, I left my original family when my soul power reached Rank 10. I headed toward the Great Star Dou Forest on my own. Around the perimeter of the Great Star Dou Forest, I met eldest senior Bei Bei and Teacher Xiao Ya, who has already left the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After that, I went into the forest on my own. On the way, I was attacked by a soul beast. It was a ten year soul beast, and I was fortunate enough to kill it. However, I was critically injured too. But then, the sky turned dreary, and a special strength entered my spiritual sea. After that, I was rescued by Bei Bei and Teacher Xiao Ya.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao told the truth about Electrolux’s background. Aside from the Skydream Iceworm, he recounted everything. He also mentioned how Electrolux had guided him in his spiritual cultivation and passed on some skills to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he only talked about how Electrolux was a light-type entity. He didn’t mention anything about necromancy. He was certain that the elders would call him an evil soul master if he mentioned Electrolux’s title as the Calamity Necromancer and told them that Electrolux had passed down necromancy to him. He didn’t want that to happen. He only claimed that Electrolux was a spiritual and light-type archmage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he finished imparting Electrolux’s background, Huo Yuhao started to talk about the Snow Empress’ Embryo that was auctioned during the last edition of the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, as well as how the Body Sect had attacked the Illustrious Virtue Hall. That was how he had managed to fuse with the Snow Empress’ Embryo, and how Electrolux had helped to seal the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After that, he talked about how he and Wang Dong’er went to the Clear Sky Sect, and how he met with danger on the Frigid Jade Essence Bed. He also detailed how Electrolux had burned the last shred of his divine sense to help him fuse with the Snow Empress, which gave birth to this Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even with the elders’ wealth of experience, they were stunned after hearing his unbelievable stories. Whether it was the remnants of a powerful archmage’s divine sense, the fusion process between the Snow Empress and Huo Yuhao or the appearance of the Spirit, it was beyond the knowledge of ordinary soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This was how I came to possess the Snow Empress’ Spirit. I call her the Snow Lady. Her look now should resemble an Icesky Snow Lady’s appearance when they’re younger. Her abilities are closely related to mine, but she has her own independent thinking. She can coordinate with me in a fight, as well as use my soul power and her spiritual power. From a certain standpoint, she’s a completely independent lifeform. With my help, her fighting abilities are able to increase significantly. Perhaps it’s because the Snow Empress is too strong. There’s also Teacher Electrolux’s divine sense that he combusted. After she fused with me, four soul rings were created. At that point in time, Clear Sky sect master Niu Tian mentioned that it was because the Snow Empress’ strength needed to take up several soul ring spots, and she had many powerful soul skills that could be bestowed upon me. I’m able to tap into the powers of three of these four soul rings now. However, I still have no idea how to activate the power of the last soul ring.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After possessing the Snow Empress’ Spirit, I thought about it carefully. Our situation was very special—we encountered the sudden change after the Snow Empress’ strength was sealed. However, what if soul masters fused with the spiritual imprint and soul power of a normal soul beast? It won’t be so dangerous. If the soul beasts are willing, I’m seventy percent confident of completing the seal and creating another Spirit. If the soul master’s cultivation is below mine, my confidence will be even higher.”</span></p>
