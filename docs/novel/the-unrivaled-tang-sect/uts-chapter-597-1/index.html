 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi snapped, “You destroyed my beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions and killed the legion commander of my Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion. This time, you even killed my remaining soul engineers. I should be thanking you? You are an enemy of the empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed. “I don’t want to kill either. However, if I don’t, I don’t know how many people from the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires would be killed by those soul engineers. It’s no longer significant to talk about this now. I’m here to ask you, does what you said to me earlier still count?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was stunned. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s mouth twisted a little. “Killing Xu Tianran.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was finally enlightened, and she smiled. She replied, “So what if it counts? So what if it doesn’t count? Are you going to kill me if I don’t stay true to my word? I’m just afraid you won’t bear to. Only you can sneak into my sedan. Even an Ultimate Douluo can’t do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little helpless as he shook his head. Tang Wutong was above the sedan. Everything she said could be heard by Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and replied, “Although I shouldn’t be encouraging you to kill your husband, Xu Tianran is an anti-hero. His existence will only pose a huge threat to the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires. Even if you go back on your word, I’ll still target him. Furthermore, I won’t show mercy just because of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi smiled and asked, “Why would I go back on my word? I should be pleased. We are only husband and wife in name. We don’t act like a couple. My kid isn’t his either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was dazed for a moment, and subconsciously whispered, “Be careful with your words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s smile turned even sweeter. “What’s wrong? I don’t believe that you didn’t soundproof this sedan. No one can hear me. What are you so scared of?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smacked his forehead and looked at Ju Zi strangely. Earlier, she had told him about her complicated relationship with Xu Tianran. However, it was his first time hearing that her son wasn’t Xu Tianran’s biological son. He was the Crown Prince!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned grim, “Did he find someone for you, then…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi answered, “Yes, he found someone for me. After that, he made me kill that person. It’s a pity that he didn’t expect me to find someone else instead of the person he assigned to me. That’s why he needs to die. If he doesn’t, everything will be exposed when my son’s martial soul awakens when he turns six. Then, we’ll both be doomed. For my son, I must kill him. You should also understand why I asked you to kill him. To a mother, she’ll turn crazy if anyone threatens her kid. She’ll fight for her kid. That’s why you must not doubt my words. I must kill Xu Tianran. We share the same opinion when it comes to this, don’t we?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished as he looked at Ju Zi. It was like his first time meeting her.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whose kid is Xu Yunhan? Who did Ju Zi bear her child with?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, he was confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw how shocked he was, Ju Zi said, “You don’t have to suspect anything. It’s my greatest secret. I feel much better having revealed it. Alright, tell me, how are you planning to kill Xu Tianran?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath and calmed himself. No matter whose kid it was, it theoretically had nothing to do with him. He shouldn’t probe either. It might be better for him to know less.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’ll depend on you. I need you to tell me Xu Tianran’s work and rest timings, as well as deployments across the entire Sun Moon Imperial Palace. If I’m not wrong, given the current situation the Sun Moon Empire is in, Xu Tianran’s defense in the palace must be erected against Ultimate Douluo. Given that, we might find it difficult to flee even if we succeed in killing him. That’s why I need more details. It’s only then that I can truly kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had personally witnessed the Body Douluo’s death when he went to Radiant City the last time. Xu Tianran wasn’t even hurt, even though Du Busi unleashed an all-out attack. This showed how protected he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t think that he was stronger than Du Busi. This was why he needed more intelligence from Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi nodded and said seriously, “You’re right. Xu Tianran is indeed defensively strong. There’s even stuff that I don’t know. I’ll tell you everything I know. To get close to him, I suggest that you follow me. You’ll only have a chance to get close to him if you get close to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. “Follow you? You are followed by your female soul engineers from the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion. How can I follow you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi smiled. “Can this stop you? Can’t you conceal yourself? Given your current abilities, who can discover you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Nothing is absolute. Just when you were attacked a few days ago, Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao discovered me and Wutong. However, they didn’t lay their hands on us. They just left. Through their instincts, Ultimate Douluo can discover us. In addition, there should be very powerful soul engineers in the palace. They might be able to discover us. That’s why your safety is greatly compromised if I follow you. You must think this over carefully.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi furrowed her brow. “That is indeed a problem. However, just don’t get too close to me. You should be able to conceal your aura. Although there are female soul engineers with me, can’t you just put on some makeup? Oh, you mentioned that Wutong is with you. Is she fine?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course. She’s very fine,” Huo Yuhao answered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold look flashed across Ju Zi’s face. “That’s a pity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really wish me dead?” Tang Wutong couldn’t take it anymore. Ju Zi was consistently teasing Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A projection appeared, and Tang Wutong appeared with it. She sat beside Huo Yuhao and held his arm. It was as if she was flaunting that he belonged to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s expression changed, and she coldly retorted, “Whether or not you’re dead doesn’t concern me. We are only working partners now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong smiled and said, “Oh, wise words. We are only working partners now. Then, please show some self-respect. Whatever it is, you are a married woman. Even if you can’t share a proper relationship with your husband, you should learn some dignity. That’s the baseline a woman should never cross.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You!” Ju Zi rarely got angry. However, she was about to act up after she was triggered by Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, stop squabbling.” Huo Yuhao interjected. “Ju Zi, describe the situation in the palace. As for concealing myself within your Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion, we’ll discuss that again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Ju Zi nodded. She didn’t want to continue further either. She was afraid that she would be able to take it, and would reveal an even more important secret. If that happened, there would be no turning back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were acting, she knew she didn’t stand a chance at all. So what if she revealed the secret? She would only create more dangers for her son in the future. Although Huo Yuhao was soft-hearted, he was a decisive person when it came to the bigger picture. If anyone knew, the ramifications were unthinkable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she thought until here, Ju Zi suppressed her deepest secret even further. She started to tell both of them about the situation in the imperial palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…this is basically what’s going on in the palace. That’s why Xu Tianran can theoretically not be killed. Your chances are slim. However, no matter what, we must try. I’ll find someone to coordinate with you when it comes to this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked, “Are you commanding your army to return to the empire? Is the war not going to continue?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi replied, “I’ve already framed the Holy Ghost Church for what you did. I won’t directly bring the army back to the empire. If I did, Xu Tianran would surely suspect me. When we reach the border, I’ll relieve myself of any military authority and lead some of my soul engineers towards the capital. There, I’ll plead guilty in front of Xu Tianran. That will be your chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Indeed, it’s not encouraged to bring your entire army back. It’ll be too obvious. Xu Tianran will also become more alert. What other plans do you have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi replied, “I understand Xu Tianran very well. This time, I’ve framed the Holy Ghost Church. One thousand soul engineers were killed. They are the main pillars of the empire. Xu Tianran won’t be able to hold it in anymore after learning that they are dead. He might even consolidate whatever strength he has when I return before attacking the Holy Ghost Church and removing them completely. When that happens, there’s bound to be a violent confrontation. That’s also going to be when Radiant City is at its most chaotic. That will be another chance to strike.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong twisted her lips. “That’s a really vicious ploy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi snorted, “Come up with a better plan if you can!”</span></p>
