 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao tapped into his understanding of the Sovereign’s Descent to beat him in terms of intent. However, he was definitely at a disadvantage in a real fight with the gap in their soul powers. However, Ji Juechen never took advantage of him. He restrained his soul power when they sparred so that they would almost be on the same level. He focused on challenging him in terms of their sword and fist intent. This was the reason why Huo Yuhao beat him every time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t that Wang Dong’s true abilities were superior to Ji Juechen’s. It was just that his appearance caused Ji Juechen to feel a weird pressure, especially when Huo Yuhao stood beside him. There was something different in their auras, as if they were two different magnets with different polarities. They attracted, fused, and became a complete entity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong landed on solid ground at this moment. Huo Yuhao grabbed onto Wang Dong’s right hand with his left. The two of them looked at each other, and an indescribable rapport rose in their hearts. Their soul power circulated, and their Haodong Power was connected again at long last after two years of wait. As the vigorous Haodong Power circulated through their bodies, they could sense the surprise they brought to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan grinned. “Why are you two lovebirds holding hands? It’s so embarrassing. Don’t waste resources.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong was stunned for a moment. “What about wasting resources?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan smiled and said, “There aren’t many good guys left. If the two of you get together and stay together, what will us girls do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong blushed from her words. However, Huo Yuhao’s figure flashed, and he blocked Jing Ziyan’s subtle approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan was inching step by step towards them as she spoke. Huo Yuhao understood her very well. She wasn’t a nice person to make an enemy out of—she wasn’t one to care about rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, a thick layer of purplish fog rose from Jing Ziyan’s body after Huo Yuhao stood in front of Wang Dong. She was engulfed by the fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very familiar with her fighting style. Diamond ice crystals quickly covered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, a black figure crawled its way out of the purplish fog. However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t its target. This figure moved in an arc and aimed straight for Wang Dong’s ribs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a quick move, but Jing Ziyan’s attempt to cause confusion was meaningless to Huo Yuhao, because he had Spiritual Detection. However, she still continued to practice it religiously every time they sparred. He was a little annoyed by that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thick purplish fog instantly swallowed Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. Jing Ziyan’s fighting style was similar to Huo Yuhao’s. They focused a lot on control and assault. She might not have twin martial souls, but she was a soul engineer—a close-combat soul engineer. She used her martial soul to control, and her soul tools to attack. Although she had only become a Class 6 soul engineer at the age of thirty, she was the best among all the Class 6 soul engineers Huo Yuhao knew in terms of fighting capabilities. Of course, this was excluding Ji Juechen as a soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao reached his left hand towards the black figure, and his entire body shone with light. An azure light shimmered, suddenly shooting out from his body, causing the surrounding temperature to drop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan’s first soul skill was called Illusory Fog, while her second soul skill was called Condensed Fog. The main effect of the Illusory Fog was to confuse and block the opponent’s vision. It could also cause the opponent to become disoriented. The Condensed Fog was very thick, and affected speed and judgment. They were both pretty effective mass control-type soul skills, and she unleashed them at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t let her gain an edge over Wang Dong, allowing his spiritual sea to reach an unprecedentedly excited state. His competitive will was greater than usual for these practice matches. He attacked boldly from the get-go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Domain of Perpetual Ice activated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything in a thirty square meter area was turned azure-green. Jing Ziyan’s fog completely condensed. Even the soul power within the tiniest particle of fog &nbsp;solidified in an instant. The fog disappeared as it fell. However, just as Huo Yuhao was familiar with their abilities, they were also familiar with his. Before the azure light shone, a layer of golden light was preemptively released from Jing Ziyan’s body. It was a Class 6 protective soul barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though there was a layer of frost on the protective soul barrier that depleted Jing Ziyan’s soul power at an alarming rate, it didn’t freeze. She created several black figures which attacked towards Huo Yuhao at the same time, then retreated with haste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao accurately caught the black figure bursting towards Wang Dong. That was Jing Ziyan’s close-combat soul tool, the Explosive Nine-Tailed Whip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This soul tool had a special ability. It would vibrate at a high frequency when it collided with something. Anything that was struck by it would face a powerful explosion. If struck against a person, their body would be blown to pieces, provided, without any defensive tools. However, this Explosive Nine-Tailed Whip was very effective at overcoming soul masters’ defensive soul skills and soul engineers’ protective soul barriers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had once resisted it using his Ice Empress’ Armor and suffered quite a bit. The explosion that he had faced was powerful, and when it happened his skin and muscles were wounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan was a little shocked when she saw Huo Yuhao reaching for the Explosive Nine-Tailed Whip. Usually, Huo Yuhao used his Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track to avoid it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used his left hand, covered with diamond ice crystals, to grab the whip, and a tremendous explosion rang out. However, Huo Yuhao still managed to grab hold of the whip tightly. He didn’t relax his grip at all. Only a portion of the diamond ice crystals blew apart, barely revealing the skin underneath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The depletion of Jing Ziyan’s soul power was still great because she had unleashed her Class 6 protective soul barrier within the Domain of Perpetual Ice. She couldn’t sustain it. Huo Yuhao’s domain-type soul skill would last for some time, especially under the support of the Haodong Power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Presently, Wang Dong’s palms were pressed against Huo Yuhao’s back. His arms had turned completely golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The auxiliary capabilities of the Golden Light Left Arm Bone and Broken Devil of Light Right Arm Bone were completely brought forth at this point. Not only did Huo Yuhao receive the usual support of Haodong Power, but the restoration of his soul power was also faster by a few times compared to the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were fighting two on two. Just as Jing Ziyan was about to give up on her Explosive Nine-Tailed Whip to escape from the Domain of Perpetual Ice, Ji Juechen’s Extraterrestrial Meteoric Sword entered the fray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a very simple… slash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen slid towards Huo Yuhao as if he were on an icy surface. His greatest strength was focusing his sword intent no matter the situation. Before his attack even arrived, his vicious sword intent had already soared. Even Wang Dong could sense the sharp aura within that threatened to slice him in two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual Detection connected their minds long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong grinned at almost the same time. Following that, a dazzling scene that hadn’t appeared for two years was presented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong switched positions to hug Huo Yuhao, his entire body clinging to his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan was stunned as she saw this scene.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Are the two of them really together like that? This…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she was soon shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Wang Dong’s wings flapped open behind his back, everyone entered a momentary trance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were fighting outside the academy’s gate, which attracted some attention. Fortunately, it was the holidays, so there weren’t too many onlookers. The main spectators were the guards at the gate. These guards hated those who disregarded school rules, but they kept silent after seeing Ji Juechen’s terrifying sword intent and the light from Wang Dong’s Butterfly Goddess Slash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front, it was Huo Yuhao whose Spirit Eyes shone with a dim golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the back, it was Wang Dong, who unleashed his Radiant Butterfly Goddess and his dazzling pair of wings.</span></p>

He was stunned to realize that the target that he’d locked onto earlier disappeared. Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were definitely still standing there, but they gave him the feeling that they had turned illusory. His vicious sword intent also stalled. Even his speed was slowed for half a second.</span></p>

It was a magical light that alternated between blue, purple and gold. An intense aura of light exuded from it, mixed with several strange undulations of soul power.</span></p>
