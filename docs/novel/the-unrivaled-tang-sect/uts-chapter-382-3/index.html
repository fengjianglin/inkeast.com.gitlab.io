The troops stationed in the East and West have already moved towards the North. Caitou should’ve succeeded.” Jing Ziyan fiddled with a little device in her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen stood beside Jing Ziyan. He now had his usual stern face on, as he tightly gripped the Judgement Sword in his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan turned to Xu Sanshi and said, “The troops outside the South City haven’t made a move yet. It seems like they’ve received an order to remain there no matter what. Are we going to start the plan or not?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi shook his head. “Let’s just wait for a bit longer. Once Yuhao makes his move, the Soul Engineer Legion outside the city will definitely not be able to stay silent anymore. They should send a few soldiers away to the front. That’s when we’ll make our move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Jing Ziyan nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi closed his eyes, as though he had entered a meditative state standing up. Streams of dull, black air started to move about near him, and the other three moved away from him. Standing near him made them feel as if they’d sunken into quicksand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t make them wait for long. After a few minutes, the large explosion coming from the southern moat occurred. The terrifying explosive power it released made the city walls tremble, and even caused cracks to appear in many places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, the army stationed outside the city made a move the instant something came up. Via her soul detector, Jing Ziyan was able to tell that the troops stationed there were a mess. It seemed like they were gathering together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Prepare to move out. Go to your designated positions!” Xu Sanshi let out a low shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi, Ji Juechen, and Jing Ziyan quickly ran towards a circle drawn not far away from Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two yellow, two purple, and two black soul rings rose from Xu Sanshi’s feet. An enormous Black Tortoise image also appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pitch-black Xuanwu Shield appeared noiselessly in his palm. As Xu Sanshi turned towards the sky, Jing Ziyan took out another soul tool and pressed a button on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When all of the aerial surveillance soul tools above Sunrise City were destroyed by the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons, Jing Ziyan quietly fired two soul tools into the sky. One was an aerial surveillance soul tool similar to that used by the Sun Moon Empire, specifically used to monitor the situation of the Soul Engineer Legion outside the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sudden appearance of an enemy, moreover in three different areas, was especially devastating. The southern city’s most important duty was to protect the water prison, but they were instantly turned into blind men following the destruction of all of their aerial surveillance soul tools. Although they were prepared to launch replacements, they still needed a bit more time. Naturally, they couldn’t be faster than someone like Jing Ziyan, who was already prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Other than the aerial surveillance soul tool, the other thing Jing Ziyan had fired was much stranger. Even she didn’t know what it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That thing was very large, around five meters long and shaped like a huge umbrella. This was the largest soul tool they’d brought along with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant Xu Sanshi announced the start of the mission, Jing Ziyan pressed the button that activated this umbrella-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immediately, a point in the sky lit up, and the huge umbrella opened up!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous umbrella had a diameter of nearly ten meters and released a bright silver light. A weak beam of light and had no offensive capabilities instantly landed outside the city by the barracks, about ten kilometers away from Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The appearance of this beam of light was precisely when the barracks was in a state of chaos, the instant they’d sent out reinforcements to Sunrise City! Due to the lack of aerial surveillance soul tools, only a few people noticed the glow of this beam of light that accompanied the opening of the huge umbrella and felt that something wasn’t right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this exact moment, a brilliant light shot out from Xu Sanshi’s eyes. With his Xuanwu Shield held high, his fourth soul ring lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The umbrella-shaped soul tool shot out another beam of light. This time around, it shone on the circle Ye Guyi and the others were standing in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi leapt forward, jumping into this ray of light. Right after that, the dark light on his Xuanwu Shield lit up brightly. With a flash, he vanished into thin air. However, a flabbergasted soul engineer from the Sun Moon Empire’s Soul Engineer Legion appeared in his place and directly fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen made an overly simple movement with his Judgement Sword, causing the struggling soul engineer to vanish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right after that, another light flashed. Ji Juechen vanished into thin air, but Xu Sanshi returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous umbrella-shaped soul tool in the sky was something Xuan Ziwen had created especially for Xu Sanshi, called a soul mirror. This was a soul tool that could utilize the mirror within the huge umbrella to magnify an image of places far away for Xu Sanshi to look at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Xu Sanshi still had his Mysterious Underworld Shield, this soul tool would’ve been of no use to him at all. However, certain impossible things had become possible following his martial soul’s evolution into the Xuanwu Shield. For example, he could now use his Mysterious Underworld Displacement on anything within his line of sight! It would now be more appropriate to call it the Xuanwu Displacement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi had used this soul tool to transport himself over to the Soul Engineer Legion, then sent Ji Juechen over afterwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, there were still not many people within the southern Soul Engineer Legion who had discovered what had just occurred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen appeared out of thin air, then gently landed. Immediately afterwards, he charged out from the circle of light that the soul mirror had created.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding soul engineers felt something was off. Immediately, someone came up to question him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen possessed a certain level of strength. He shot forward like a bolt of lightning and grabbed at a soul engineer who was questioning him. He threw him into the circle of light with a flip of his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And so, Xu Sanshi returned. After three consecutive displacements, Xu Sanshi, Jing Ziyan, and Ye Guyi used the same method to forcefully charge into the southern Soul Engineer Legion several dozen kilometers away from them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a Titled Douluo who was skilled in spatial abilities wouldn’t be able to use an Instant Teleportation that could cross a distance that far! However, Xu Sanshi had done it, albeit with the aid of a soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, he was drained of a large amount of soul power following this displacement. He held a Milk Bottle in each of his hands and began recovering his soul power immediately after he re-appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only at this moment did the men in the barracks realize that something was wrong. However, the soul mirror in the sky had already been put away by Jing Ziyan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little thing was still useful to them. There was even a possibility that they would need this to save Huo Yuhao and the rest later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A large number of soul engineers started to surround them, blocking them off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first person to make a move, however, was still the Sword Fanatic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if he had love in his heart, his fighting style would never change! With his Judgement Sword pointed towards the sky, he took a step forward with his left foot. Then, he made a half-turn and swept his longsword horizontally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense, chilly light spread out in a fan-shaped sweep. The soul engineers who were activating their soul tools in order to attack felt a chill pervade their bodies, then lost consciousness in the next moment.</span></p>

Ji Juechen’s horizontal sweep contained a biting cold sword light that reached out a full hundred meters, and no living beings remained wherever his sword passed. At least thirty Class 3 and 4 soul engineers were cut down with a single stroke of his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fellow is really scary!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Ye Guyi felt a chill go up her spine. She clearly remembered how she and Nan Qiuqiu had constantly challenged him to fight. She could now tell from the imposing aura coming off Ji Juechen’s sword that he had been going easy on them all this while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juchen didn’t stop moving. With his sword in his hand, he shot through areas with the most number of people like a bolt of lightning. The Judgement Sword in his hand seemed to look disdainfully upon its enemies, and corpses littered the ground wherever it swept past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would be very hard to determine who was the strongest person in the Tang Sect. However, if one were to talk about the most destructive, and the person whose ability to kill was greatest, the answers to these questions would be He Caitou and Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one were to take out the use of soul tools, then only Ji Juechen would remain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many soul engineers already had their soul tools pointed at Ji Juechen. However, the troops stationed here were not the best troops that the Sun Moon Empire had. Their greatest strength lay in defending the military front, as well as the soul tool formations they’d set up in advance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as a soul engineer’s worst nightmare was fighting against a soul master in close-combat, the way this army fought was also susceptible to close-combat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area inside the front itself was the weakest point of the Soul Engineer Legion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen was already a Soul Sage, but his destructive power wasn’t something that ordinary Soul Sages could compare to. Those Class 3 and 4 soul tools were completely destroyed by his chilly sword intent before they even reached him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only person who made him pause slightly was a Class 6 soul engineer. However, the sad thing was that this soul engineer was skilled at close-combat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, Ji Juechen gripped his sword with both hands. After standing still for a brief moment, the area between him and the Class 6 soul engineer turned into a patch of grey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Sword Fanatic’s Domain, the Solitary Domain!</span></p>

The Sword Fanatic would never show mercy to an opponent. This was especially true after he’d gotten a new lover. His lover was standing on this battlefield, and one less opponent meant one greater chance that his lover would remain safe. This had also caused the fighting intent in this cold man to reach an unprecedented level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, in Ji Juechen’s own opinion, he stubbornly believed that the reason his will to fight had grown stronger was because he had found the right path. Yes, this was the power of love!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Ji Juechen was killing his way through the battlefield, the others didn’t just laze around. As if she had sprinkled beans on the ground to create soldiers, Jing Ziyan released an all-terrain self-driving soul fort and hid herself within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a member of the Tang Sect, although she didn’t know how to create soul tools, she was relatively proficient at using them. One couldn’t forget that she had originally come from the Sun Moon Soul Engineering Academy. After seriously practicing their use a few times, she was naturally skilled at using this all-terrain self-driving soul fort!</span></p>
