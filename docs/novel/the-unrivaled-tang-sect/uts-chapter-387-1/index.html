After sensing that it wasn’t having any effect, he quickly made adjustments. A few Netherworld Swords still came towards the two of them.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er’s aura didn’t seem to be weaker than the Titled Douluo opposite them, even though they were staggering backward.</span></p>

He used two chains to trap them, soul tools that could restrain soul power. Those who were Soul Emperors and below couldn’t possibly use their abilities under the restraint of such soul tools. To the Third Elder, Nan Shuishui was under the influence of the Soul Eradicating Powder, while Nan Qiuqiu was only a Soul King. He just needed these two soul tools to restrain them.</span></p>

Since they could compete in the Continental Youth Soul Master Tournament, that meant that they weren’t twenty years old yet. They were around the same age as her daughter, but they had already demonstrated how brilliant they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Shuishui had always thought that her daughter was already very outstanding.

When I draw their attention later, leave. It’s impossible to charge out from here, given our abilities. We only have one opportunity, and I’ll help you create it. At most, they’ll capture me. When you return to the Academy, just think of a way to rescue me.”</span></p>

There wasn’t much time left.</span></p>

She spun around, and they changed positions. She was now behind Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

When she came behind him, she wrapped her arms around his waist. She stuck close to his body and hugged him without any gaps.</span></p>

She wrapped her arms around his waist strongly, but didn’t make him feel restrained. He felt indescribably relieved. Wang Qiu’er’s surging soul power poured into his body, while she seemed to forget that she was on a battlefield right now. She twisted her head to one side and gently rested it on the back of Huo Yuhao’s shoulder, staying close to him.</span></p>

Just let me use this last moment to completely sever this yearning in your heart. You must live well in the future, and find someone who dotes on and loves you. Forget me.</span></p>

At this moment, his arms drooped beside his body, and his hair didn’t move. His eyes started to fill with silver light, and a look of remembrance slowly spread across them.</span></p>

I can’t continue to charge towards the path of Gods with all of you in the future. When I leave, I’ll pass all of you to Qiu’er. Qiu’er isn’t less gifted than me. She has the same power of destiny in her body, and she even has the pure bloodline of a Dragon God. In the future, it’ll be easier for her to reach the level of a God. I’ll pass your strengths to her at the last moment. Follow her, and continue to charge towards it.</span></p>

The Snow Empress, who looked like a teenager right now, looked slightly sorrowful, and now seemed to be a little more quick-witted too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they couldn’t do anything right now. Huo Yuhao dominated his own spiritual sea. The Skydream Iceworm was even the one who had personally conferred this authority onto him. Right now, that became their biggest restriction.</span></p>

However, they were only able to brush past his body, no matter how strong and concentrated they were. There seemed to be an unprecedentedly strong force on his body that was protecting him and preventing any interruption.</span></p>

Right now, he seemed very peaceful and quiet. He shut his eyes and sat cross-legged. As he stretched his hands in front of him, his index fingers and thumbs formed a heart shape.</span></p>

Every soul engineer from the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion was moved without any reason. They were even unable to hold their soul tools anymore, and lowered them. They were all in a daze as they looked at the projection of the burning man.</span></p>

No one could clearly explain what they were. Even for a spiritual-type soul master, his understanding of spiritual power was very limited if his cultivation wasn’t high enough.</span></p>
