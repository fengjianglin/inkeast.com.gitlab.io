 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming couldn’t just be described as astonished now. He was completely horrified as he looked at Huo Yuhao. He retreated almost instantly, and widened the gap between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This, this person's control of spatial power has actually reached such a standard? He managed to seal all the surrounding space in just an instant earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Silvermoon Divine Light Barrier taps into spatial power. No matter how strong an attack is, it can be directed into space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this person managed to seal all the surrounding space and prevented the Silvermoon Divine Light Barrier from escaping. After this, he relied on his unprecedentedly strong spiritual power to tear the barrier apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Kong Deming wasn’t quick enough, his natal soul tool would have been completely destroyed. If that had happened, he would have been critically hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t even take a look at Kong Deming. His attention was all on Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I should be asking you why instead. Why? Ju Zi, tell me why? I trusted you, but you betrayed my trust. You started a war just as I was in closed-door cultivation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s voice was very low-pitched. However, every word that came from his mouth generated a weird spiritual undulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion had gathered. They encircled him, Tang Wutong and Dai Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When those in Star Luo City saw Huo Yuhao appearing, they were all extremely delighted after a momentary shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps the others couldn’t sense Huo Yuhao’s condition. However, Elder Xuan could tell that his abilities were already way above his. This meant that Huo Yuhao was already an Ultimate Douluo! Furthermore, Huo Yuhao definitely had a third soul core. This was because he couldn’t have become an Ultimate Douluo without one. Eve though Elder Xuan didn’t know how he had done it, he saw hope right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen, fire stationary interference shells. Those from Shrek and the Tang Sect, follow me to receive Yuhao and Wutong.” Elder Xuan instructed. Everyone from the Tang Sect was already very eager. They immediately flew out from Star Luo City towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was in a daze as she looked at Huo Yuhao. However, she didn’t step back. “Why? Why did you tell me you’d be in closed-door cultivation for a long time? Did you know that I didn’t dare to start a war with you around? Why? Alright, I’ll tell you why. You should know why I chose to marry Xu Tianran. I did it for revenge. I did it to avenge my parents. It’s him, it’s him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she pointed at Dai Hao. “He’s the person who killed my father. It’s him. He led his troops and occupied our land. It was his soldiers who killed my father. My mother died of sorrow. My family was broken up because of him. He made me an orphan. I only lived for revenge. I lived to kill him. If you didn’t let me start a war, I’d need to wait for ten years. I can’t wait for ten years. Did you know? I’m afraid of you. You’re too strong.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wasn’t afraid of how strong the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires would be in ten years. How can soul tool technology be caught up to so easily? But I was afraid of you. I was afraid that you’d become stronger. You were already so strong. I’ve personally seen you reach the abilities of an Ultimate Douluo. How much more powerful will you be in ten years? I can’t judge. When that happens, won’t you stop me if I try to start a war? How can I take revenge if you intervene? How can I kill my enemy? This was why I went back on my word. If I can kill him, so what if you kill me? Yuhao, let me do it. Let me kill him. If you do so, I won’t touch Star Luo City anymore. Since you’re back, I can give up on Star Luo City. However, Dai Hao must die. He has to die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she finished, Ju Zi was already hysterical. Her entire body was shaking tremendously. There was only boundless hate in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at her coldly. “Ju Zi, I didn’t expect you to become like this. For your own selfish reasons, you started a war in the continent. You went back on your promise. There’s no need to say anything else. Pull your troops back immediately and lead them back to the Sun Moon Empire. Return the territories that belong to the Heavenly Soul Empire, Dou Ling Empire and Star Luo Empire. Otherwise, I’ll spare no one. So what if I massacre your empire? That’s right, you’re right to be afraid. I’m back. I won’t let the Sun Moon Empire rule the continent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Joke!” Kong Deming was so furious that he started laughing. “Ignorant kid, do you think you can change the entire war just by yourself? Even if we have to pay a price, you’ll die here today.” As he spoke, he lifted his right hand, and the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion immediately dispersed. They formed an arc and surrounded Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao seemed to ignore them. He turned around and shouted at everyone from the Tang Sect and Shrek Academy, “Everyone, don’t come over. Let me settle it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was anxious, and was about to speak. However, Elder Xuan stopped. He even opened his arms wide and stopped the rest from moving forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone, stop. Let Yuhao settle this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was anxious as he said, “Elder Xuan, there are only two of them. The Sun Moon Empire…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan shook his head and replied, “If numbers were the most critical factor, the three empires wouldn’t have lost to the Sun Moon Empire. Don’t forget that Huo Yuhao is an Ultimate Soldier the academy nurtured. Now, he’s really an invincible Ultimate Soldier! Trust him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After listening to Elder Xuan, everyone calmed down. However, they all turned to Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked coldly at Ju Zi. Silver lights flashed before he was already back at Tang Wutong’s side. Similarly, he was beside Dai Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao!” Dai Hao was a little astonished as he looked at him. He wanted to say something, but he didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since the war began, Huo Yuhao had vanished. Even those from Shrek Academy didn’t know where he had disappeared to. When they saw him again, he was already so strong. This left the White Tiger Duke completely astonished. He had been resigned to his fate. However, who knew that Huo Yuhao would come to save him at such a critical moment? Furthermore, he felt very strange now. It felt as if Huo Yuhao was a little different from how he was before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked calmly at the White Tiger Duke and nodded. He said, “Retreat first. I’ll deal with things over here. There are some things we need to settle between us too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was stunned. However, he still nodded. He didn’t say anything further. He turned around and flew towards those from Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi suddenly shouted, “No, no, he can’t go. He’s not allowed to go!” She knew that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were already back. If she missed this opportunity, she would probably not have a chance at revenge anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Ju Zi roared furiously, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer’s attacks began!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blinding lights instantly shot at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. There were close to three hundred Class 8 soul engineers, guided and commanded by Elder Kong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were completely drowned in the glaring lights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi shook. Although she wanted to exact revenge, her heart still skipped a beat when she saw Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong engulfed by the lights. It was as if something terrifying was going to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Are they going to…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her worry only lasted for an instant. As the lights flashed, they silently vanished. A silver door quietly appeared in front of Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, and all the attacks were devoured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how strong the attacks were, what was the point if they struck nothing? Huo Yuhao reacted in the same way as Kong Deming when facing the Star Luo Empire soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that Huo Yuhao’s control of spatial power was clearly on a higher tier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming seemed to have sensed this. He ferociously lifted his right hand. This time, his Silvermoon Divine Light Barrier covered a larger area as it engulfed Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver door from earlier disappeared within the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a Class 10 soul tool, how could the concept behind it be so simple? Kong Deming could also seal space. Furthermore, he could seal a large region of space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kong Deming was the most brilliant when it came to soul tool technology. He had always believed that one could control his own destiny. No matter how strong one was, he couldn’t resist an attack that was too overwhelming. One could control space, but what if he lost that control? How could they possibly direct the attacks of three hundred Class 8 soul engineers away? It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he only had a simple goal, which was to kill Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong with the strongest attack while sealing the space around them.</span></p>
