 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The uneasiness in his heart was growing more intense. He had developed an acute sense of destiny after gaining the power of destiny which had been passed on to him by the Three-Eyed Golden Lion. Hence, whenever he started to feel uneasy, it usually meant that something was actually about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What exactly is going on here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao slapped his forehead and asked himself what he would do if he were Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they only had two soul engineer legions, it would be of little use to penetrate the Dou Ling Empire’s defensive lines forcefully. After all, they would not even be able to occupy and defend the cities they might conquer without any troops coming to back them up. No matter how strong a soul engineer legion was, the manpower it had was still limited!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, they can only sabotage…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wait, that’s it! They can only sabotage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao’s heart skipped a beat. He thought of a possibility—a possible action which he had done not too long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right! Ju Zi’s current situation was exactly the same as the time when he brought his three soul engineer legions to perform sabotage operations within the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only difference was that Ju Zi’s soul engineer legions would not possess the ability to turn invisible. However, when it came to pure fighting power, her soul engineer legions—which were all legions that were on par with the Hand that Protects the Nation—were definitely more powerful than the Academy’s three soul engineer legions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the Dou Ling Empire’s borders were fairly well defended, it would not be impossible for the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions to evade detection from their aerial surveillance soul tools. If that was the case…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao suddenly understood what was going on. At the same time, cold sweat started to trickle down his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What Ju Zi had planned to do was very simple. She was merely repeating what he did in the Sun Moon Empire. She would not allow the two soul engineer legions to run around and perform sabotage operations all over Dou Ling Empire to create panic. After all, without the protection of the spectral demiplane, the soul engineer legions would ultimately be destroyed if they were to strike deep into the Dou Ling Empire on their own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what if she only had a single target? In other words, what if she was only thinking of attacking a single city? How would that pan out？</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">More cold sweat started to trickle down Huo Yuhao’s back.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s right. That must be it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was targeting the capital of the Dou Ling Empire! Huo Yuhao immediately ascended into the sky without any hesitation as he increased his speed to the maximum. He headed straight for the Dou Ling Empire’s capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was nothing which was more fear-inducing than to destroy the capital and exterminate the royal family of the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had once attempted to do this in the Sun Moon Empire, but failed. However, this time around, the Dou Ling Empire had already sent their elite troops to Shrek City, and thus the defense within their capital must be very weak. Without their powerful troops and cultivators, how could they fend off the two soul engineer legions that were planning to launch a surprise attack on them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi, Ju Zi! You really are a very scary woman!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once again, Huo Yuhao developed the thought to kill Ju Zi. Every single plan that she had formulated seemed so simple, yet so deadly at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao kept accelerating as his figure transformed into a laser beam. Once in a while, he would disappear into space before reappearing somewhere far ahead. He was so quick that there were repeated sonic booms in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao understood that the chances of him actually making a difference had become very slim. If Ju Zi had already set all of this up before even setting off to Shrek City, her soul engineer legions—regardless of how many people there were—would definitely have enough time to head to the capital after infiltrating the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they would definitely not be able to move as quickly as he did back in the Sun Moon Empire. But so what? Their current speed would be more than enough. As long as they could disguise themselves on land and take the more obscure paths, they would definitely be able to reach Dou Ling City—the capital of Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though soul tool development within the Dou Ling Empire had been very quick for the past few years, their aerial surveillance soul tool technology was still very lacking. It was impossible for them to dispatch a large number of aerial surveillance soul tools like the Sun Moon Empire did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were simply too many possible ways that they could attack Dou Ling City. Even Huo Yuhao could think of multiple ways to use the two soul engineer legions to deal a devastating blow to the capital of the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was impossible for the soul engineer legions to not bring Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells on such a mission. How was the capital going to defend itself against such attacks?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao continued to speed through the air, he closed his eyes. He had always been losing to Ju Zi when it came to such tactics!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If only I could have figured all of this out earlier…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this is about to unfold at the Dou Ling Empire, will the same happen in the Star Luo Empire? I hope Ju Zi didn’t lie to me. She better not do the same thing to the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at least the Star Luo Empire still had his father around. Even if something were to happen to the royal family, the White Tiger Duke would still be around to allay everyone's fears. The empire would not be consumed by mass hysteria overnight. Hence, Ju Zi had made the right decision to land a devastating blow against the Dou Ling Empire first. All hell would definitely break loose within Dou Ling Empire. And when that happened, her next target would be…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After streamlining his thought process, everything became a lot clearer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi's real target was ultimately the Star Luo Empire! When chaos broke loose within Dou Ling Empire, their troops would naturally return to their own empire. Nothing was more important than stabilizing their own empire from within.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under such circumstances, the Star Luo Empire would lose a natural ally, and Ju Zi would then be able to go all-out on the Star Luo Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As long as she was able to take the Star Luo Empire down, the Dou Ling Empire would not even be a problem. She should be able to get them to surrender to the Sun Moon Empire easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, the Star Luo Empire was connected to the Sunoon Empire geographically. Huo Yuhao knew that the Star Luo Empire would have no chance of defending themselves if the Sun Moon Empire were to call their Imperial Soul Engineer Legion in for help. The Sun Moon Empire would then be able to sandwich the Star Luo Empire from both sides.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not have an answer to the problem which lay before him. This seemed too much like a lost cause. The whole of Ju Zi's strategy had formed in Huo Yuhao's mind. But he was unable to think of a way to counter it. At the same time, Huo Yuhao recognized that his realization might have been too late.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he knew he still had to head over to Dou Ling City. If he could reach it on time, he might still be able to rescue some members of the royal family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao's flying speed was simply impossible. While he was still at the border of Dou Ling Empire at dawn, he was already deep in the territory of the Dou Ling Empire when the sun finally started to rise. He was getting closer to Dou Ling City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at this instant, Huo Yuhao could sense continuous, intense soul power fluctuations from afar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like I was right.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sped forward without any hesitation as Dou Ling City came into view. However, when he looked down to gaze at the city, Huo Yuhao could not help but lose hope.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could clearly see the thick, dense smoke which was rising up from Dou Ling City. The volume of smoke definitely could not be released by a few chimneys. Upon closer scrutiny, it seemed as though the entire city was in flames. It was a truly frightening sight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Intense soul power fluctuations continued to radiate from that direction. As Huo Yuhao continued to get closer to the city, he started to hear the sounds of explosions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao knew the exact location of Dou Ling City, he did not know where its palace was. However, how likely was it that the palace could be spared from the fire that was spreading across the entire city?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao's answer to that question was negative. He closed his eyes as a painful expression formed on his face. He knew he had arrived too late!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when he opened his eyes again, they flashed with an intense murderous intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body flickered as he threw himself across the sky in a parabolic arc towards Dou Ling City. Huo Yuhao was able to see a large number of people flickering within the dense smoke from afar. He saw a few familiar blue figures, as well as some figures that glowed with dark yellow light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion. Ju Zi had really sent out one of Sun Moon Empire’s Hand that Protects the Nation. The other soul engineer legion should also belong to the Hand that Protects the Nation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dark yellow soul tools…? Could they be from the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion? The best soul engineer legion among the four beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gritted his teeth as fury and rage flashed across his eyes. He released his spiritual power entirely as it enveloped the entire city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since there was no way he could stop them, he planned to avenge all the dead people in Dou Ling City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After enveloping the city with his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao detected a sizeable area about fifteen kilometers away from Dou Ling City within an inconspicuous forest that bristled with soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The size of this soul tool deployment area was at least three times the size of an average Sun Moon Empire soul tool deployment area. From his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao was able to tell that those soul tools were the most advanced models from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that the soul tool deployment area was placed in such an obscure position meant that they must have started attacking from that place. At the same time, the forest would provide the best cover and concealment during their escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So what if they were to lose it if they were able to complete their attack on Dou Ling City?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I must destroy their path of retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could accurately sense the presence of about fifty soul engineers stationed within the soul tool deployment area with his Spiritual Detection. On top of that, their linked defensive barrier was half-open. If something unfortunate were to happen in Dou Ling City, they could at the very least defend themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could not help but admire the wealth of experience that the beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions had. They had even prepared sufficient resources to retreat safely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, you have bumped into me. In that case…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao landed quietly at a spot that was not too far from the soul tool deployment area. He silently opened his Spectral Gate and released his companions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he even tried to explain anything to them, Huo Yuhao had dashed towards the soul tool deployment area in front of their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao's Icy War God’s Armor immediately formed on his body as its deep blue glow fused with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was sprinting towards the soul tool deployment area, the soul engineers within the installation were unable to detect his movement with their surveillance soul tools because of his Imitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thin streak of Mayan blue light which was not overly glaring flickered past them. And at the very next instant, Huo Yuhao crept in from the top of the protective soul barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A deafening alarm began to ring within the soul tool deployment area. However, was there any point in that anymore?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao successfully reached the linked defensive barrier, even fifty elite soul engineers would be powerless against his enraged Eyes of the Asura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead of using his Morning Dew Dagger, Huo Yuhao used his Ghostcarving Blade to rip apart the half-activated linked defensive barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghostcarving Blade had an immensely destructive effect on any energy form or object. In fact, it was more destructive than the Life Guardian Sword in this regard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After slicing the barrier with his Ghostcarving Blade, Huo Yuhao dashed into the soul tool deployment area. His Spiritual Detection had already given him the positions of where the soul engineers were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his body flickered, he darted towards one of those positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the alarm, the fifty soul engineers within the area had already reacted to it. All sorts of soul tools were radiating with their own light. The surveillance soul tools were already trying to pinpoint where the intruder was coming from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has the barrier been destroyed?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul engineers who were stationed in the area were all shocked beyond belief. They had believed that the protective soul barrier was so tough that even a Transcendent Douluo wouldn’t be able to break it! On top of that, their surveillance soul tools did not even give them warning. How was that possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that, they caught sight of Huo Yuhao’s figure as he appeared before them. There was no longer a need for him to use his Imitation to conceal himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The interior of the soul tool deployment area was also protected by soul tools, just in case it was breached by their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After showing himself, ten streaks of Soul Light Rays immediately fired towards him. These Soul Light Rays were designed with extremely vicious intentions. They consisted of Penetrative Rays, Scorching Rays, and Decomposing Rays, a type of ray which was inconspicuous, yet extremely destructive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao did not even try to avoid these attacks. He simply allowed them to land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Soul Light Rays could not penetrate the Icy War God’s Armor at all. Huo Yuhao raised his right hand and made a pressing motion with it as a golden light flashed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A series of explosions could be heard as the heads of the eight soul engineers who were standing closest to him exploded instantly. Huo Yuhao’s current spiritual power was definitely on par with that of any Ultimate Douluo. Even though these soul engineers were members of the Hand that Protects the Nation, they were only cultivators with four or five rings. They were like paper in front of his Spiritual Blast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, an intense chill spread within the soul tool deployment area from Huo Yuhao’s body. It was able to instantly envelop the entire area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those soul engineers within the area who were trying to attack Huo Yuhao could not help but abandon that idea as they mustered their soul power to counter the impending impact of the cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those soul engineers who were weaker were frozen in mere seconds, while the stronger ones found their movement restricted by the extreme cold.</span></p>
