<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “That’s why we can only barge our way in. The strategic position of Eastern Sun City is very important to the Sun Moon Empire. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have stationed so many troops there. Once we complete our destruction of this place, we’ll greatly affect the Sun Moon Empire’s deployment in the north. In this way, we’ll be closer to our goal. That’s why this fight cannot be avoided.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s eyes brightened immediately, and she said, “Yuhao, I have an idea. Since the Sun Moon Empire has installed a lot of spiritual detection soul tools within their soul formations in Eastern Sun City, such that you can’t even use your spiritual power, does it mean that they are guarding against enemies who are adept at spiritual abilities? If that’s the case, is it possible that they are guarding against aquatic soul beasts?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao suddenly thought of something. He had known Tang Wutong for a long time. He immediately understood what she was thinking, “Are you saying that there are spiritual-type aquatic&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">soul beasts here which can become my Spirit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Huo Yuhao got the Ice Bear King as his Spirit, the soul rings of his Ultimate Ice martial soul were already completely filled. The Ice Bear King gave him his eighth soul ring, and his remaining strength was sufficient to confer on him his ninth soul ring. When his second soul core successfully formed, he would be a true nine-ringed Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, things were different for his other martial soul. Currently, Huo Yuhao had five Spirits – the Snow Empress, Ice Empress, Skydream Iceworm, Ice Bear King and Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass. Four of his Spirits affected Huo Yuhao’s Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. But his Spirit Eyes only had seven rings so far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao once swore that he would never kill a soul beast to obtain soul rings ever again. This made it even harder for him to obtain a spiritual-type soul ring. Although his spiritual power was very great right now, soul rings were still very significant for soul masters. This was applicable even for Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could obtain the last two soul rings he needed for his Spirit Eyes, his spiritual abilities would definitely be greatly increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was also trying to ride his luck. It would be great if he could get a spiritual-type Spirit and two more soul rings for his Spirit Eyes. Otherwise, he would just forget it. Anyway, he was still a Titled Douluo if he had nine soul rings for his Ultimate Ice martial soul. Although it would be regretful if he had two fewer soul rings for his spiritual-type martial soul, it wouldn’t be too impactful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he immediately realized that he might stand a chance after Tang Wutong reminded him! If he could obtain a spiritual-type soul ring here, his abilities could improve further. The biggest benefit to increasing his spiritual power was increasing his probability of success when he tried forming his second soul core in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whichever method he used to form his second soul core, his spiritual control was very important. Even though his spiritual control was already very strong now, he was still some way off from the Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo who were trying to form their second soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dim lights flashed, and Huo Yuhao revealed a pensive look in his eyes. After a brief moment, he said, “If your conjecture is right, we’ll need to make a trip to the Ice Sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “Let’s go together once we’re finished with things over here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Less than fifteen kilometers away from the northern city gates of the Eastern City was the northern side of the Ice Sea. It was very close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao suddenly felt as if there was something moving in his spiritual sea. He thought of something, and generated a connection with his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should ask me about something like this.” The Snow Empress’ voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power grew stronger, his Spirits had to go through his spiritual sea to inform him that they wanted to connect to him. Huo Yuhao relaxed the control of his spiritual sea before their intentions were made known to him. He didn’t do this intentionally. After his cultivation improved, his spiritual sea reached a solid state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! Although the Ice Sea wasn’t the ice plains of the Extreme North, it was still extremely cold. The Snow Lady was once the ruler of the ice plains of the Extreme North. Naturally, she knew best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smacked his own forehead. “I was really stupid. It would have been easier for me to just ask the Snow Lady whether a spiritual-type soul beast can appear here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He opened his Spiritual Interference Domain, and everything around him became slightly blurry. No matter whether it was the aerial surveillance soul tools or those who passed by, they couldn’t see anything for ten meters around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Snow Empress.” Huo Yuhao gently called.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two beams of light shone at the same time. One was white, and the other was green. Two beauties appeared in front of Huo Yuhao. They were the Ice and Snow Empresses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and said, “You are really dumb. You don’t even know how to tap into your advantages. Who else is better equipped than my sister and I when it comes to the Extreme North?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “Don’t mock me anymore. Are there any spiritual-type soul beasts in the northern Ice Sea?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress answered without any hesitation, “Yes! Of course there are. Anything is possible in the sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up after hearing her words. He also didn’t expect the Snow Empress to be so certain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “It seems like neither of you are very familiar with aquatic soul beasts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly and said, “Of course not. They aren’t very useful for soul masters like us. Since that’s the case, we don’t have much research on them. Even in Shrek Academy, there are very few records on them. I vaguely recall that a million year soul beast once appeared. It was called the Deep Sea Devilwhale King. Our ancestor, Tang San, once obtained a soul ring from the sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “There are many aquatic soul beasts. In fact, there are more aquatic soul beasts than there are soul beasts on land. Furthermore, they are very strong. Their overall abilities are above that of land soul beasts. The only advantage that soul beasts on land possess is their outstanding fighting strength. I have to say that Di Tian is indeed very powerful. There was originally the Deep Sea Devilwhale King among aquatic soul beasts who was very strong. However, even he wasn’t Di Tian’s match. According to what I know, in the aquatic regions close to the Douluo Continent, there are a few such aquatic soul beasts. As for what types of soul beasts exist in further aquatic regions, I have no clue. However, I can still confirm that none of them would be Di Tian’s match even if they exist. Di Tian is already the extreme. If not for the fact that he can’t become a god, he would have tried for it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress and Di Tian weren’t friends. It was also precisely because of this that her appraisal of him was honest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression changed slightly. His future goal was to defeat Di Tian! If he couldn’t do so, he couldn’t truly become a god and inherit the godly seat of the God of Emotions. It was only by defeating Di Tian that he could fulfil his goal. Right now, he didn’t just learn how strong the Beast God was from one aspect. Di Tian was deservedly the strongest creature on the entire Douluo Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong asked, “Snow Empress, is there an aquatic soul beast that’s adept at spiritual power in this Ice Sea? If there is, is it possible for it to become Yuhao’s Spirit?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress hesitated for a moment before replying, “In the sea, there are many soul beasts that are adept at spiritual abilities. However, there’s only one sufficiently strong species nearby. It’s the Mermaids.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mermaids?” Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were both curious. They had never heard of such a name before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “Mermaids are also known as genies in the sea. They are the best in terms of spiritual abilities among all the aquatic soul beasts that I know. Their upper bodies are like humans, while their lower bodies resemble that of fish. Most of them are female, and the females rule their species. Whether it’s a male or a female, the upper half of a Mermaid is always very nice. The reason why they’re called Mermaids is because of their leader, who is known as the Princess of the Sea. The Princess of the Sea is the ruler of this aquatic region. Among the few aquatic soul beasts that can claim to have similar cultivation to mine, one of them is the Princess of the Sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Her spiritual power is extremely strong. If she’s fighting in the sea, even the Evil Eye Tyrant might not be able to beat her. However, the Evil Eye Tyrant is definitely stronger on land. Because of how strong they are and their spiritual abilities, many other species of aquatic soul beasts ally with them. Their overall abilities are rather strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong asked, “Since aquatic soul beasts are so strong, why don’t they venture onto land after their cultivation reaches a certain point? Wouldn’t they benefit more?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress smiled slightly and said, “You can’t use the mentality of land bound soul beasts on aquatic soul beasts. To them, the sea is their habitat. It’s where the living conditions fit them. Also, a big problem for them is that their abilities are greatly weakened when they leave the sea. The longer they are out of the sea, the more their lives will be in danger. Under such a condition, they are naturally not inclined to leave the sea.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “If Yuhao wants to obtain a Spirit from an aquatic soul beast, Mermaids are definitely a good choice. There are hundred thousand year Mermaids. It’s just that…” As she spoke until here, she furrowed her brow before continuing, “Mermaids feel that they are above others. They don’t really respect any other species of soul beasts. Furthermore, they are very strong. Trying to convince them won’t be easy. After all, aquatic soul beasts don’t regard humans as their natural enemies. Even that empire that specializes in making soul tools never threatens them.”</span></p>
