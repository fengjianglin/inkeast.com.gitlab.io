<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou controlled his machine and charged directly into the city through the enormous hole that he had blown open. Countless cannon barrels snapped open on the metal sphere, and more than twenty barrels that looked like spikes concentrated penetrating white light. More than twenty over beams of white light surged into the air in the next moment and pierced through the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul tools were called long-range piercing cannons, and were Class 8 soul tools. This soul tool had the second longest range; stationary soul cannon shells could go farther.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Booming sounds resonated in waves through the sky as flashes of fire and light flickered again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the result of the Eye of the Asura working together with the Origin of Destruction, and piercing cannons that could lock onto its targets swept over all the surveillance soul tools in the sky above Oak City. Oak City immediately became blind, so that they were temporarily unable to seek reinforcements from cities a little further away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long-range transmission soul tools were starting to appear within the Sun Moon Empire as technology continued to advance. However, these transmission soul tools required satellites in the sky for transmission. Otherwise, they couldn’t reach their extremely long ranges. The first things that Huo Yuhao and He Caitou locked onto were these satellites, as doing so meant Oak City was temporarily unable to send any information or messages out. Furthermore, their Fort Soul Engineer Legion wouldn’t leave any traces behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou stopped attacking once he completed this attack. Instead, he stood fast and proudly in an empty space within the city’s gates. Oak City didn’t have any strength to resist at all, and He Caitou could trample through this city with his all-terrain self-driving fort even if he was all by himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fort Soul Engineer Legion had entered the city by now, but the other members didn’t charge in through the city gate. They instead scaled the city’s walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the reason why all-terrain self-driving forts were called that; walls couldn’t stop them. Every self-driving fort’s eight limbs were extremely sharp, just like eight long spears. Each limb had three different joints, and its toughest component was at the bottom. It was crafted using a special kind of metal that was very hard and tough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These limbs could casually pierce into the city’s walls through mechanical power, and could carry their heavy and bulky bodies as they climbed swiftly. The self-driving forts could scale the city’s walls with a few motions, and could even attack with soul rays and soul cannons as they climbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Somebody watching from the sky would be able to see a very spectacular scene. Three hundred all-terrain self-driving forts appeared on Oak City’s walls at almost the same time before they quickly scaled it. Some remained to keep their vantage point, while others entered the city. From this moment onwards, Oak City had been completely taken over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This couldn’t even be considered a battle, as everything was simply too easy, to the point where it would raise people’s hackles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Taking over the government building and the several warehouses that Huo Yuhao had detected earlier happened fifteen minutes later, as screaming and shouting could be heard everywhere in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou had ordered the Fort Soul Engineer Legion not to attack civilians, but they still did everything they could to destroy and damage several taller and more conspicuous buildings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emptying warehouses was a simple task for soul engineers. Storage soul tools had limited space, but Huo Yuhao’s spectral demiplane had almost unlimited space!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Huo Yuhao took off, he had ordered Er Bai to lead the undead creatures to create a large makeshift warehouse inside his spectral demiplane. This place was more than suitable for storing all sorts of resources and items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One hour later, the Fort Soul Engineer Legion disappeared just as suddenly as they had appeared, and Oak City was in ruins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when the soldiers who had previously hidden away came back out to check the damage, they realized that there had been very few casualties in the pillaging process. There were several who had been injured from the damaged buildings, but there were very few who had died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they really wanted to cry when they inspected their warehouses. Their granaries had been emptied, and their large warehouses which were used to store rare items for trading were also emptied, while several of their major businesses had all been cleaned out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were in the cold north, and that meant they were extremely dependent on food. Winter was coming, and it wasn’t hard to imagine the burden that empty granaries would have on Oak City. The citizens were already fearful and beginning to panic because of this sudden ambush, and their panic would be amplified when they saw that they no longer had any food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A long time ago, pillaging an entire city with an army which consisted of soul masters was impossible. But now, Huo Yuhao and the others had accomplished this feat by relying on formidable soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fort Soul Engineer Legion’s soul masters were resting inside the spectral demiplane, but nobody could hide the excitement on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their excitement didn’t come from the resources and items they had pillaged. Instead, their excitement came from the feeling of battle. They were a group of amateur soul engineers who were fighting together, and that sensation of destruction when nobody could fight back against them simply felt too wonderful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect’s senior members were gathered inside the warehouse. Bei Bei stared at the mountains of food and heaved a sigh as he said, “If not for the fact that we were at war, stealing food from a city of citizens isn’t anything to be proud of!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi laughed and said, “Eh, why do I remember that you were the one who came up with this immoral idea? Why are you suddenly shedding crocodile tears?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei shot a glare at him. “Food is part of a nation’s core. We’re here to wreak havoc and destroy things, so making our move on food is the easiest. Food isn’t like soul tools. Places that are storing large amounts of soul tools and materials are definitely heavily guarded, and we can’t go head-to-head with our enemies. It’s different for food. Any city’s citizens need to eat, and we can choose places like Oak City where they don’t have sufficient strength to defend themselves. We can minimize losses and complete our mission as quickly as possible at the same time, and we can cause panic as well. My idea is excellent!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi nodded seriously and said, “It is excellent! Just a little immoral!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So be it, for the Douluo Continent’s future!” Bei Bei answered valiantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Oak City is an important city in the Sun Moon Empire’s northern territory, except their defenses were so slack because there’s almost no possibility that a battle can occur here. The granaries in Oak City are very important for the Sun Moon Empire’s northern territory, as the food that is stored there covers tens of thousands of square kilometers in the north. The Sun Moon Empire’s entire northern territory will be greatly alarmed after our ransacking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s our next target?” Bei Bei asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao opened his map. He placed his finger on Oak City’s position before he shifted his finger towards the east and stopped at another city. The city looked a lot larger than Oak City on the map.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eastern Sun City is the Sun Moon Empire’s number one city in their northern territories. It’s the only city which can be considered a large city. Oak City was just an opportunity for us to train. Eastern Sun City is our most important objective in our northern invasion. We can retreat from the north as long as we conquer Eastern Sun City. Eastern Sun City contains the largest warehouses for storing food and all kinds of resources. There are twenty thousand proper soldiers stationed within the city. Furthermore, there must be soul tools defending it, and they are likely to be equipped with linked soul tools. There will be a single soul engineer legion stationed there under normal circumstances, as it is the most important stronghold in the north. But the Sun Moon Empire has mobilized their great armies for the invasion, which has resulted in an empty back rank. Eastern Sun City’s soul engineer legion is likely to have been deployed, and there won’t be many even if there are some who remain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have broken through Oak City so quickly, and it will need some time to report this to Eastern Sun City and request backup. We have destroyed their satellites after all, so there’s no way they can make any long-range transmissions. Therefore, we have to attack Eastern Sun City, and quickly. Eastern Sun City will fall no matter what, and we will not sustain many losses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded and said, “Alright, then you can go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou rubbed his palms together. “Leave this to me and the Fort Soul Engineer Legion. What’s twenty thousand soldiers? My enormous fort will sweep them clean.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and laughed as he said, “We cannot be complacent, second senior brother. Attacking Eastern Sun City is very important, and we can’t be sure how formidable its defenses are. Therefore, we have to change our tactics.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How?” He Caitou asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled and whispered something into his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eastern Sun City was the Sun Moon Empire’s most important stronghold in the north. The city was positioned toward the eastern side of the Sun Moon empire’s northern territory, and was less than a thousand kilometers from the Heavenly Soul Empire’s original borders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the Heavenly Soul Empire’s territory in that direction had now been drawn into the Sun Moon Empire, while Eastern Sun City’s strategic importance naturally became a lot smaller than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Eastern Sun City was still the Sun Moon Empire’s most important stronghold in the north. The city was very close to the Ice Sea, and the soldiers and soul engineers stationed there were responsible for defending against any aquatic soul beasts that could come out from the Ice Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aquatic soul beasts that could live in the Ice Sea almost all possessed both ice-type and water-type abilities, and were very powerful. They would occasionally attack as they attempted to hunt for food along the shore, and to kill humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Eastern Sun City had the responsibility of fighting them, and to prevent aquatic soul beasts from wreaking havoc along the shores.</span></p>
