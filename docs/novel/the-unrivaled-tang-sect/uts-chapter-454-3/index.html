 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doing experiments on his body here was far too dangerous; a single misstep would be equivalent to creating a bomb inside himself. Huo Yuhao decided that, after his body had recovered, he would channel his soul power out of his body and control it outside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There should be no problem with his spiritual power. At the very least, he had to figure out the secret of how soul power and spatial power fused together. He would have to ask Elder Xuan for the rest after he returned to the Academy. Even though Elder Xuan wasn’t an Ultimate Douluo, he was still a Rank 98 Transcendent Douluo after all, so he should also be working in the same direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body was getting better by the second, and his passageways were repairing themselves continuously. Huo Yuhao could get out of bed himself by nightfall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t get to eat much for dinner, due to his physical state. He ate a large bowl of nourishing meat soup and some noodles that were cooked until they were very soft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone from Shrek who was sitting in the canteen glanced at Huo Yuhao again and again. What a miracle… what was happening to Huo Yuhao was simply incredible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was someone whose passageways were almost completely shattered. Not only did he not die, but it had only been three or four days, and he could already get up and walk? What was that, if not a miracle? They would have inferred that he had an undying body if they hadn’t known him so well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi stared at Huo Yuhao’s pale expression and said, “Yuhao, who are you going to assign to take care of you tonight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu blushed when they heard his words. Tang Wutong was drinking her soup, and her spoon quivered faintly as she spilled some soup back into her bowl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “There’s no need. We are inside the Northwestern Field Army’s main camp, and we are very safe. I can move around by myself too, so I don’t need someone to take care of me. Thank you, everyone, for the past few days, and I know I’ve also worried you. I will completely recover after two more days, and then we can return to the Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu seemed a little dejected when they heard him say that he didn’t need anyone to take care of him, because that meant that they no longer had any chances to be close to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong heaved a deep sigh of relief. She didn’t even take a single glance at Huo Yuhao throughout dinner. Every time she thought about wiping and cleaning Huo Yuhao the previous night, she would be uncontrollably embarrassed. She couldn’t even regret it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why did I help him do something like that the other night? That’s just unbelievable...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi glanced at all three ladies, and a strange smile appeared on his face. “Alright, then, you have to be careful tonight. Right, Wutong is very near you, and you can call her if you feel that something is wrong with you. She should be able to hurry over as soon as possible. Right, Wutong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Tang Wutong raised her head and looked at Xu Sanshi, and then at Huo Yuhao. Her expression was clearly a little rigid as she nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought she wasn’t very willing as he watched her expression and hurriedly said, “It’s alright, Wutong. I don’t think I’ll have to trouble you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Tang Wutong acknowledged before she lowered her head once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone returned to their tents to rest after dinner. The Northwestern Field Army’s camp was rather empty at this moment, as most of the army had already been deployed into the Ming Dou Mountain Range. The White Tiger Duke and Princess Jiujiu had to direct everything over there, so they weren’t around, either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt a lot better as he crossed his legs and sat on his bed. His new passageways had reconnected completely, and the next thing he had to do was get used to them. At the same time, he had to let his passageways consolidate and strengthen themselves with nourishment from his life energy. They should be able to recover completely soon enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life Gold is truly a mystical existence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao controlled the Life Guardian Blade with his mind as green light flickered, and it suddenly appeared in front of him and hovered in the air, point-down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The room was a little dim, but the dagger’s appearance instantly painted everything with green hues. Green light wove around the room as dense life energy rippled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao waved his hand, and the dagger ended up in his grasp. The blade wasn’t very long – about seven inches – and the grip was about four inches long. The Life Guardian Blade could only be considered a small dagger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao immediately felt a thick wave of life energy fill his body as he gripped it, and everything in his body glowed green.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He leapt down from his bed, and removed a tough piece of metal from his storage ring. Huo Yuhao swung the dagger in his hand, and green light flashed over the metal before it vanished into thin air just like that, as if it had never existed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beam of light flashed on the Life Guardian Blade, and it didn’t change much, but Huo Yuhao could feel that it now contained some life energy inside that didn’t belong to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao exerted his will once more, and the Golden Dragon Spear flew out from his Eye of Destiny. The Life Guardian Blade pressed against the Golden Dragon Spear, and the Golden Dragon Spear flickered and absorbed the life energy that belonged to some other object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something occurred to Huo Yuhao. Just as Wang Qiu’er had said before, the Life Guardian Blade and the Golden Dragon Spear were clearly complementary to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life energy absorbed by the Golden Dragon Spear could sustain the Life Guardian Blade, while life energy absorbed by the Life Guardian Blade from objects could be used to replenish the Golden Dragon Spear. If these two items could be completely fused together, then their strengths would be improved. Their strengths might even be increased to a frightening level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Life Guardian Blade belonged to him, while the Golden Dragon Spear belonged to Wang Qiu’er, so he couldn’t attempt something like this before. Furthermore, the Life Guardian Blade was just a small carving knife back then, and its volume was too small. But now, the blade’s bulk had increased, and both items belonged to Huo Yuhao. Could he attempt this now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pinched the Golden Dragon Spear’s tip as he contemplated this, before he pressed it against the Life Guardian Blade’s grip.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Life Guardian Blade shone with faint green light, while the Golden Dragon Spear radiated faint ripples of golden light. Those lights intertwined and fused together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I can’t just tie them together, can I? A simple connection like that cannot unleash their potential with one another! What do I have to do for this to work?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stuck. He could sense that his choice was right, but how he should fuse them together was another tough question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned as he descended into deep thought. The Life Guardian Blade radiated tremendous life energy, while the Golden Dragon Spear seemed a lot more reserved. There seemed to be golden light flowing inside the Golden Dragon Spear’s deep golden hue. Perhaps that was because it had tasted the blood of many creatures, and the spear itself effused a somber and desolate aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both items had the same characteristic of absorbing life energy, but they were different in that the Life Guardian Blade absorbed life energy from objects and converted it into life energy that humans or animals needed, while the Golden Dragon Spear did the opposite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could these two be fused together?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued contemplating as he pressed both items together, and focused on their transformations as they were pressed against one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly discovered that neither changed too much when they were pressed together. They didn’t reject each other, but they didn’t attract each other, either. They seemed like two distinct objects that couldn’t be simpler, and nothing much happened when they were pressed together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took out another piece of metal. He allowed the Life Guardian Blade to absorb its life energy… yes, something began to change...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Life Guardian Blade flashed once before golden light circulated around the Golden Dragon Spear. However, this didn’t take longer than an instant before the two items finished interacting. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seems like I can’t make them fuse together. At least, I don’t have the ability to do so at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head in exasperation. His Eye of Destiny flickered and reabsorbed the Golden Dragon Spear. At that moment, an idea struck him; if he didn’t have the ability to fuse them together, could they fuse them together through destiny within his Eye of Destiny?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Eye of Destiny contained the mystical power of destiny, and was a power that not even Beast God Di Tian could understand. The Beast God couldn’t detect the Life Guardian Blade’s existence before this, because it was contained within Huo Yuhao’s Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had stored and nourished both items in his Eye of Destiny separately before, and let them interact with each other. What if he changed his methods?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that, Huo Yuhao immediately reabsorbed the Life Guardian Blade into his Eye of Destiny, controlling and shifting it so that it was placed in the same place as the Golden Dragon Spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t feel anything special. They were both under the influence of the power of destiny, but they were just sitting there calmly, no different from how they were on the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t worried, as he knew that good things only came to those who waited. Both items fusing together could possibly give him an unexpected surprise, while it would be nothing much even if those items didn’t fuse. They were both trump cards on their own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao finished dealing with two things that could almost be considered godly weapons, and his thoughts returned to his recollection of Di Tian’s soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body hadn’t completely recovered at this moment, but his spiritual power almost had. His soul power was also flourishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to experiment within his body, as he would be in big trouble if something went amiss. However, everything was different outside his body. Even though Huo Yuhao knew that he should wait until his body had fully recovered before attempting this experiment, he couldn’t resist the temptation right now. His desire for power and strength were even stronger after facing off against Ye Xishui, and comprehending the secret to Di Tian’s soul power would undoubtedly be very helpful for his improvements in cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao thought for a moment before deciding to begin his experiment. He was doing it externally anyway, and he wouldn’t hurt himself as long as he controlled his soul power appropriately. He could stop his experiment the last time he attempted it inside his body, so he should have no problems outside it, he assured himself before starting his experiment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao raised his right hand, and a thread of soul power gradually appeared. The Mysterious Heaven Technique’s soul power was present as a faint white thread; this was his purest soul power, as it didn’t interact with either of his martial souls.</span></p>
