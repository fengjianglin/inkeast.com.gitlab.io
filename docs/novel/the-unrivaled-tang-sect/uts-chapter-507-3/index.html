 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned. He only wanted to quickly leave, so why was he more well-liked now than he was in the previous blind date?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could still clearly remember that there were seventeen Sea God Fairies the last time he was here. In the second segment, one lamp was extinguished for him, by Wu Feng. This time, all sixteen lamps were still lit for him. None of the other students who went before him managed to keep all sixteen lamps lit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, this wasn’t because of good fortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inner courtyard female students were all intelligent and strong. In addition, they had great taste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two main reasons why Huo Yuhao had all the lamps lit for him. First, it was his ‘performance’ in the canteen. There had been a few female students taking their meal. They personally saw how Huo Yuhao frightened that middle-aged teacher without even unleashing his martial soul! How strong was that? Furthermore, he had a very special aura about him, even though he wasn’t particularly handsome. No matter what, he easily caught their attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second reason was because of Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Tang Wutong had not been in the Academy for a long time and was only a teaching assistant, she was still a student of the inner courtyard. She held two identities at once. Normally, she interacted quite a lot with the young women of the inner courtyard, and they respected her. After Zhang Lexuan, Han Ruoruo, Wu Ming, and the rest of the female seniors from the previous generation of students left, Tang Wutong was now the backbone of the current generation of female students in the inner courtyard. Furthermore, she was an exceptional beauty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the other female students saw how Tang Wutong allowed Huo Yuhao to remove her bamboo hat without resisting, they were all astonished. This also deepened their interest in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If even Tang Wutong approved of him, could he be ordinary?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, this magical result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s lips twisted a little. However, no matter what, everyone was vain to some extent. He felt slightly better after seeing that sixteen lamps had been kept on for him. Naturally, he couldn’t just fall into the lake as an escape measure...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The segment continued. From the second row onwards, the male students weren’t so lucky anymore. Since they didn’t remove any bamboo hats, they didn’t leave any deep impressions on the female students. Very soon, many of them were out of the blind date as all the lamps were extinguished for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the second segment ended, eighteen of the young men had been eliminated. It was the highest elimination rate in recent years, exactly half of the young men were gone. Even so, there were still two more young men left then young women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The high elimination rate had something to do with the female students, too. They were all very outstanding, and good catches. Naturally, they were more demanding when it came to choosing their partners. Given the current situation, the ratio of female to male students was almost one-to-one. The young men who remained bore high hopes that they could return with a lady in their arms!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the second segment ended, the remaining male students were rearranged again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao, who only wanted to show his face at this ceremony, was arranged in first place after all the lamps were kept lit for him. He was now in the limelight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Zhang Lexuan was the one who spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After the first two segments, I believe all of you should have some simple understanding of one another. Next, we shall begin the third segment, Love at Second Sight. This time, all female students should take note that you can’t choose randomly as you did in the second segment. Once you make a choice, you must take responsibility for your choice. Every male student has a minute to introduce himself. After his self-introduction, he needs to come to me and tell me the number of the Sea God’s Fairy that he fancies. After all the male students have made their introductions, the female students will make their choices. Your choice in this segment will be your final choice. You can’t go back on it. After the choices are made, we’ll proceed to the fourth segment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Male students, please take note that you can demonstrate what you believe is your greatest ability when you introduce yourself. You can also introduce your cultivation and other things. As long as you believe your words can capture the heart of your desired partner, you can mention anything. This time, we’ll mess up the order and pick who goes first through lots, for the purpose of fairness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that, Huo Yuhao immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He couldn’t fully recall these later segments. However, it was a good thing that he wasn’t going to go first. He was just here to show his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The first person we’ve picked out is Huo Yuhao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao’s face suddenly stiffened up again.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why am I still the first to go after picking lots?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao, you can introduce yourself. You have one minute.” Zhang Lexuan was definitely amused as she looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh, okay.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged her words and started to introduce himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hi everyone. My name is Huo Yuhao.” Huo Yuhao drifted forward a few steps as he controlled the lotus leaf beneath him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, he only said this line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s all?” Zhang Lexuan was infuriated.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fellow is indeed doing all he can to avoid the limelight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at Zhang Lexuan. He thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since I’m just here to show my face, you can’t possibly force me to say more than I want.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, who knew that his simple introduction piqued the curiosity of the female students?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan snorted and said, “Your introduction is too simple. It won’t be fair when our Sea God’s Fairies make their choices. Since you’re shy, I’ll speak on your behalf.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’m shy?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhang Lexuan cheerfully said, “Huo Yuhao is a student of the inner courtyard and a disciple of the Tang Sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing this, Huo Yuhao felt rather pleased. This was all true. Furthermore, she was advertising the Tang Sect. Why did he not realize that this was a good way of advertising the Tang Sect? Everyone from the inner courtyard was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhang Lexuan’s words after this left him looking more and more bitter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He joined Shrek Academy at the age of eleven and managed to emerge as eventual champion during his first test after joining the Academy, along with two of his teammates. After that, he revealed his shocking talent. He possesses twin martial souls. The last time the Academy evaluated his abilities, we concluded that he was a Soul Sage. Currently, we are unsure of his abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He has taken part in the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament twice. The first time, he was a substitute, but he eventually became the main force of the team. In the last fight, he turned the tables and defended Shrek’s glory, emerging as the eventual champion. From then on, he was named as one of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, along with his teammates. At the same time, he is also the main control-type soul master among Shrek’s Seven Monsters. He’s their core and spiritual figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“During the second tournament, he represented the Tang Sect, but there wasn’t any result in the tournament due to a sinister ploy by the Sun Moon Empire. However, the top two teams back then belonged to both the Tang Sect and Shrek Academy. His outstanding performance undoubtedly made him the most outstanding participant of the tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s one more thing. Huo Yuhao is the person who established the Spirit Pagoda. He’s the inventor of Spirits, and is the current Pagoda Master of the Spirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Apart from this, he has also contributed greatly to the Academy. There are many things that we can’t reveal. However, the contributions that he has made have earned him a place in history as the youngest ever member of the Sea God’s Pavilion. He’s the pride of the inner courtyard, and a current elite.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Zhang Lexuan’s introduction, the entire place went quiet. Everyone was completely silent. All the Sea God’s Fairies opened their mouths in shock as they stared at Huo Yuhao. The other male students were equally shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the other parts of the introduction didn’t astound them, then finding out that Huo Yuhao was the one who invented Spirits and the person who established the Spirit Pagoda had deeply astonished them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All this while, no one really knew his name because he had a call sign in the Academy. The Eye of the Asura, founder of the Spirit Pagoda, was a familiar character that every student in the Academy knew!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sea God’s Pavilion’s youngest member and the founder of the Spirit Pagoda! These two identities were considered sacred in Shrek Academy!</span></p>
