 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled, “If you think it is, then it is one. So what if I threaten you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Power was everything. Jing Hongchen was evidently scared out of his wits by Huo Yuhao. However, he couldn’t do anything. He couldn’t not be terrified. The three of them were not as strong as Huo Yuhao. Moreover, Tang Wutong was with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want to know?” Jing Hongchen tolerated the humiliation and opened his arms wide to stop Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao asked, “I want to know where the Sun Moon Empire’s army is right now. It’s too troublesome to find them slowly, and I just so happened to pass by Heaven Dou City. That’s why I’m here to ask you. Give me accurate information, and I’ll leave immediately.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen was furious. “You want me to betray my empire? No!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. He didn’t say anything else, and just pointed his right hand at Jing Hongchen. As he lifted it, a golden sun and blue moon slowly rose behind him. An unprecedentedly strong aura was instantly unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was right. When Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong fused their martial souls, they possessed the abilities of an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen shouted, and his body shone with red light. A disc drifted in front of him, and bright red light shone. It turned into a huge screen that protected him and his two grandchildren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little empathetic as he looked at him. Then, he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a doubt, Jing Hongchen had unleashed his Class 9 defensive-type soul tool, Hongchen’s Yearning. Compared to ordinary Class 9 soul engineers, Jing Hongchen was much stronger. He also had many powerful Class 9 soul tools with him. However, he was only a Class 9 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An icy-blue glow flashed before disappearing. In the sky, a layer of morning dew appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White scratch marks appeared on the surface of the Hongchen’s Yearning. Jing Hongchen groaned and only felt as if his body was being separated. He felt as if he was being torn apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a terrifying feeling. Jing Hongchen was frightened. Before he could even react further, Huo Yuhao was already within the Hongchen’s Yearning, and Tang Wutong with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature fell to negative one hundred and fifty degree Celsius. The extremely low temperature was the best domain to use. Whether it was Jing Hongchen, Xiao Hongchen or Meng Hongchen, they all felt as if their blood had coagulated. Their soul power, blood and even aura weren’t flowing properly. They had no choice but to circulate their soul power to maintain their body temperatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, they saw a smile on Huo Yuhao’s face. It wasn’t an arrogant smile, but it gave them the feeling that they couldn’t resist him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head at the three of them. As he moved his right hand, dark gold blades of light appeared. He smacked down another of Jing Hongchen’s Class 9 soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A low-pitched dragon roar echoed in front of Tang Wutong. A purplish-gold dragon head spat out countless streaks of flowing light, suppressing Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen, who could only struggle with all their might.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong used their Instant Teleportation and disappeared. When they reappeared, they were already in front of Xiao Hongchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen, who was about to turn fluid, was locked in his current state by the low temperature. Huo Yuhao palmed the air, sealing the space around him. This caused Xiao Hongchen’s body to freeze up immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s body shone brightly with golden light. As a sonorous dragon roar echoed, Jing Hongchen and Meng Hongchen’s attacks were completely devoured by that purplish-gold light. They couldn’t pose any threat to Huo Yuhao at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong returned to where they were as they instantly stepped back. However, Xiao Hongchen was in front of them right now. The dark gold Xiao Hongchen had been completely frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pressed his palm against Xiao Hongchen’s head. He appeared very calm as he looked at Jing Hongchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen’s body was shaking. It wasn’t because he was furious, but because he was terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’s too strong. That’s right, he’s really that strong!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he personally witnessed it, he finally understood why Huo Yuhao said everything he did earlier, and why he had promised to let them off. The three of them were no longer fit to be his opponents. The revenge that Xiao Hongchen was harping on earlier was just a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Ultimate Douluo who’s only twenty plus years of age? It seems like this world is really about to change! The heavens gave the Sun Moon Empire such powerful soul tools, but they gave such a freak to the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. Who can challenge such a freak? At least it’s not possible for me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen shut his eyes in pain. He nodded at Huo Yuhao and said, “Alright, I’ll tell you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was twenty years ago, or even ten years ago, he would have protected his own dignity even if it was at the expense of watching his biological grandson die in front of him, given his character as the Hallmaster of the Illustrious Virtue Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, things were different now. He was old. He was an old man. He treasured his family more. He only had these two outstanding grandchildren now. They were his entire hope. They were also the hope of his family. Jing Hongchen’s subordinates and friends were almost all dead from that huge explosion. Otherwise, why would he be in this state? This was why he had no choice. He could only compromise, as long as he could save his grandchildren’s lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded. As he shook his hand, Xiao Hongchen was in front of Jing Hongchen again. The effect of ice on his body also disappeared. Huo Yuhao wasn’t even a little afraid that Jing Hongchen was going to go back on his word. If he could capture Xiao Hongchen once, he could do it again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen was still shuddering even after he returned to normal. He wasn’t afraid, but was still shaking from the cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was a little dazed as he looked at Huo Yuhao. If he still had some energy when he was furious, he was only left with desolation now. Yes, it was desolation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What should I do? How can I resist him?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t find the answer. He even understood that he might never find an answer for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head at him and said, “I know how to show gratitude. Thanks for putting pressure on me then. Thanks for being my opponent then. I won’t kill you today. You don’t have to be so frightened either. If you want to seek revenge, I welcome you anytime. However, you need to work harder.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen’s face suddenly turned blood-red. He spat out a mouthful of blood and staggered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen was furious. “Go, please go. The Sun Moon Empire’s army is two hundred and fifty kilometers to the south of Heaven Dou City. They are resting at a place surrounded by mountains. Go! Don’t let me see either of you again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao continued speaking, he might forever lose his grandson. His only wish was for them to leave now. The best thing was that he would never see them again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at Jing Hongchen. “Hallmaster Hongchen, take care.” After getting the answer he wanted, he held Tang Wutong’s hand before turning and leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait a minute.” Jing Hongchen suddenly called.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stopped in his tracks and turned back to look. “Hallmaster, what else do you have to say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen paused for a moment before saying, “Huo Yuhao, I have something to tell you. Currently, the War God Empress is under investigation by His Majesty. I don’t know why, but it has something to do with the Holy Ghost Church. I heard that the soul engineers in the army killed many of the lower-tier members of the Holy Ghost Church. Only the evil Titled Douluo managed to escape. There’s also some confusion regarding this in the capital. That’s also the reason why the army hasn’t done anything yet. However, I also hear the War God Empress has deployed newly-trained soul engineers to fill up the gaps in the soul engineer legions. They are accumulating their strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Huo Yuhao was a little astonished as he looked at Jing Hongchen. He hadn’t expected him to say something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen continued, saying, “Currently, the newly-trained soul engineers should be on the way. I predict that His Majesty wouldn’t want to offend the two Ultimate Douluo in the Holy Ghost Church over this matter. However, the strength under His Majesty is getting stronger and stronger. It’s also not a fact that the two Ultimate Douluo are at an absolute advantage. At least the War God Empress should be fine. His Majesty trusts her the most. Furthermore, he’ll still need to rely on her to help him in the war. It’s a good opportunity now. As for what you can do, it’ll depend on you. I shall not speak further. I shall just take it as a favor that I’m repaying for not killing us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Thanks for telling us.” After he finished, he held onto Tang Wutong and turned around before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Hongchen and Meng Hongchen were both astonished as they looked at their grandfather. They wouldn’t have expected him to tell Huo Yuhao such a confidential secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Neither of you can’t understand why, right? I’m telling him the truth. I didn’t lie at all. Don’t you think I’m betraying my empire?” Jing Hongchen spoke self-mockingly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jing Hongchen looked at him coldly. “Now do you know how ridiculous you were acting earlier? Let me tell you. Even if our empire rules the entire continent, Shrek Academy will be fine. The empire will not target the academy. The reason is simple. It’s an academy, not an empire. This is also why Shrek Academy is very clever. They’ve never leaned towards any side. They only influence soul masters and soul engineers. No matter which empire rules the continent, it’ll want such a prestigious academy to stick around. This is why Shrek Academy has survived so long, and will continue to survive. If the empire really wants to destroy Shrek Academy, it might even catalyze its own downfall. This is because there are too many powerful individuals in the academy.”</span></p>
