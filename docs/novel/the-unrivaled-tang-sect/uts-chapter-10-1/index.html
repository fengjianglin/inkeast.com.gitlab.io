 <p><strong>Book 2: Academy of Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 10.1: First Experience with Soul Tools</strong></p>
 <p>Teacher Zhou Yi was incomparably domineering when she was in front of her students, but she seemed to have completely lost that tyranny when she was in front of this middle-aged man named Fan Yu. She amiably said, “I’m referring to what you brought up last time; the matter regarding spiritual-type soul masters using soul tools.”</p>
 <p>When he heard what she said, Fan Yu’s eyes couldn’t help but light up. His gaze subconsciously fell on Huo Yuhao, who was standing to the side. “He has a spiritual-type martial soul?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi nodded her head and said, “Correct. His name is Huo Yuhao, and he’s a new student. He has a spiritual-type body soul.”</p>
 <p>After seriously looking over Huo Yuhao, Fan Yu shook his head and said, “This won’t do. His body and soul force are both too weak. I’m afraid that he won’t even be able to control one of the weakest soul tools. Furthermore, his talent is similar to the current state of his body; it’s too far away from what I need.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi humphed and replied, “Are you looking down on my foresight? True, Huo Yuhao is still weak right now, but his soul skill is extraordinary. It’s the most practical spiritual-type skill that I’ve ever seen. Huo Yuhao, let him experience it for a moment.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” As a student, Huo Yuhao could only participate as a spectator right now. He immediately activated his Spiritual Detection Sharing and used it on the middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>Following that, Huo Yuhao was so startled that he almost lost focus. When his Spiritual Detection Sharing came into contact with the middle-aged man, the latter slightly furrowed his brow. In that instant, Huo Yuhao felt as if there was a terrifying beast in front of him that had suddenly opened its maw—as if it wanted to swallow him in one gulp.</p>
 <p>This feeling even caused the sleeping Skydream Iceworm to wake up. A refreshing feeling appeared in his spiritual sea, causing Huo Yuhao’s astonishment and horror to disappear.</p>
 <p>The terrifying aura that was emanating from Fan Yu’s body disappeared after only appearing for an instant. As soon as it did, he allowed Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing to link with him.</p>
 <p>“Eeeh!” After a short moment, Fan Yu discovered the subtleties contained within Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing. Great waves immediately rose inside of his originally peaceful eyes.</p>
 <p>“There’s actually a spiritual-type skill like this? How could a skill like this come from a ten year soul beast?” Fan Yu looked at the white soul ring floating below Huo Yuhao’s body with a puzzled look. In addition to the puzzled look on his face, he also had a surprised look.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao naturally wouldn’t mention the Skydream Iceworm, so the Wind Baboon became his excuse once again.</p>
 <p>“A ten year Wind Baboon?” Fan Yu and Zhou Yi were both speechless.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi gazed at Fan Yu and said, “Could this be a mutated soul skill?”</p>
 <p>Fan Yu nodded his head and said, “There’s a chance. This little guy’s martial soul is a body soul, and a spiritual-type one at that. His existence in and of itself is a mutation. Furthermore, the soul beast that he chose for a soul ring is an existence that’s completely incompatible with him. This must’ve triggered an extremely rare soul skill mutation. The fact that a spiritual-type martial soul didn’t suffer a backlash from absorbing a wind-type soul ring is already a miracle, but I didn’t think that a mutation like this would appear. I’m afraid that this is a miracle that would be completely impossible to reproduce.”</p>
 <p>“Caitou, come here.” Fan Yu beckoned towards the group of people standing next to the wall. A youth immediately rushed over.</p>
 <p>When he saw the youth, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but be startled. From his face, he didn’t look to be much look older than Bei Bei. However, he was extremely tall—over two metres tall. His shoulders were even wider than Fan Yu’s, while his naked upper body exposed his tanned muscles. There wasn’t any hair on his head, and he was much more tanned than an ordinary person. He had a simple and honest appearance.</p>
 <p>“Teacher.” The youth bowed respectfully towards Fan Yu.</p>
 <p>Fan Yu pointed at Huo Yuhao and said, “Go and fire a round of the stationary soul cannon. Let this kid support you, and try to hit a moving target.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” The tanned youth didn’t ask any questions. He smiled simple-mindedly at Huo Yuhao and said, “Little brother, follow me.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi said, “Huo Yuhao, just use that skill of yours to support him.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Huo Yuhao now somewhat understood why Zhou Yi had brought him here. He hurriedly chased after the tanned youth.</p>
 <p>“Nice to meet you, little brother. My name’s He Caitou, but everyone simply calls me Caitou. Thus, you can just call me Caitou.” The tanned youth gave Huo Yuhao another simple-minded smile.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao replied, “Nice to meet you, big brother He. I’m Huo Yuhao.”</p>
 <p>When he said the three words ‘Big brother He’, He Caitou became stunned for a moment. After he’d recovered, he gave Huo Yuhao a big thumbs up and said, “Little brother, you’re not bad.”</p>
 <p>Even future historians wouldn’t know that the friendship between ‘Eyes of the Asura’ Huo Yuhao and ‘Origin of Destruction’ He Caitou had actually started from a simple sentence like this.</p>
 <p>When the two had arrived at the edge of the testing field. He Caitou tapped the black belt on his waist, causing a light to flash, and an item that was extremely strange-looking—in Huo Yuhao’s opinion—appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>It was a roughly 1.5 metre-long tube made of black metal. Its cross-sectional diameter was around 15 centimetres, while its ‘tail’ was slightly thicker. It had many mysterious patterns carved on it.</p>
 <p>He Caitou held it in an extremely proficient manner. After pressing the back of the metal tube with his right hand twice, a cover immediately came off, revealing a hole that was approximately twenty centimetres long and ten centimetres wide.</p>
 <p>He quickly tapped his waist with his left hand once again, causing a shuttle-shaped piece of metal to appear in his hand. He carefully placed it into the exposed hole in the metal tube, before carefully putting the cover back on. When he raised his right hand, the metal tube landed on his right shoulder.</p>
 <p>He Caitou, who’d previously given off an extremely simple feeling, suddenly had a large change in temperament when he raised the metal tube to his shoulder. Huo Yuhao’s martial soul was a spiritual-type one, thus his keen level of awareness caused him to feel a strong sense of danger from He Caitou all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Huo Yuhao, let’s start.” He Caitou’s voice echoed out.</p>
 <p>A golden light flickered through Huo Yuhao’s eyes, and his Spiritual Detection Sharing accurately landed on He Caitou’s body. He Caitou’s eyes exuded a trace of astonishment, and he excitedly shouted into the distance, “Moving target, fire.”</p>
 <p>There seemed to be someone controlling the targets from the other side. With a ‘swoosh’, a disk-shaped object shot out from a corner in the distance, and was headed directly towards Huo Yuhao and He Caitou.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a strong undulation of soulforce instantly exploded from He Caitou’s body. Three soul rings—two yellow and one purple—all simultaneously flashed, and the metal tube on his shoulder seemed to tremble slightly. A strong halo of black light began to revolve around the surface of the metal tube, and He Caitou’s body gently moved. The metal tube was now aimed at the round disk flying towards them at high speed.</p>
 <p>“Bang—” A violent explosion echoed out, and the metal tube instantly released a dazzling black light. The huge amount of turbulence that suddenly appeared caused Huo Yuhao to stumble and almost fall down.</p>
 <p>However, the black light didn’t hit the flying round disk. Instead, it brushed past it, and flew into the distance. After it had traversed a hundred or so metres, it collided fiercely with a metal plate in the distance, causing a violent explosion to erupt. An enormous stream of air rebounded straight towards them, causing He Caitou to quickly move to protect Huo Yuhao behind him.</p>
 <p>The air current lasted a few seconds before it gradually calmed down. On the other hand, the round disk didn’t fly out of the testing area, but rather landed near them.</p>
