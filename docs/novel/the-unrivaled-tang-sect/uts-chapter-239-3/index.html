How’s Yuhao’s body?” Cai Mei’er’s voice sounded outside after a cough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er recalled that there were others outside, and her face started to blush, while her ears turned red, too. She quickly let go of him and glanced at Huo Yuhao with a displeased look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao reached forward subconsciously and poked her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her skin was soft and delicate, like almond beancurd. Her fresh scent was calming, and Huo Yuhao felt intoxicated at this moment. If not for the fact that there were many people waiting for him outside, he would have kissed her countless times…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two of them exited the tent, everyone else was amused as they surrounded the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were both blushing at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er turned around and leaned on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. She pounded him lightly a few times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A guy was more thick-skinned. Although Huo Yuhao’s face was red, he soon recovered from the embarrassment and said, “Dean Cai, eldest senior sister, sister Ruoruo, Yongyue, Mo Xuan. It’s great that all of you are fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er smiled and asked, “How’s your body?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “I’m still a little weak. Yesterday’s fight was too intense. If not for Qiu’er’s help, we would’ve died. Yes, how is she? Is she alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er replied, “She’s still sleeping. Fortunately, her life wasn’t in danger after you treated her. She’s indeed the possessor of the Golden Dragon. She is recovering quickly even though she’s suffered critical injuries. There have been no relapses, either. What happened to the both of you yesterday?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was still a little afraid as he thought of yesterday’s experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had been extremely unlucky. Firstly, they had met the three evil soul masters. After that, they met the three mutant soul beasts. Their misfortune wasn’t normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He recounted how he had acted alone after he realized something was wrong using his Spiritual Detection, and how he and Wang Qiu’er had contended with and trapped Zhong Liren. He also repeated what had happened to them after that. He told them almost everything that had happened, but concealed two things. First, he didn’t talk about his Light of Purification. He wove a lie and said he used his Spiritual Shock twice consecutively, managing to destroy Zhong Liren’s beast spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he talked about how he teamed up with Wang Qiu’er, he also hid the fact that he had unleashed a martial soul fusion skill with her. This martial soul fusion skill wasn’t really anything worth concealing. However, he decided to conceal it as he recalled what he and Wang Qiu’er had experienced yesterday, and when he saw the worried and even terrified Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the same reason, he also hid how he had used his own blood to save Wang Qiu’er’s life. The former two lies could still be exposed by Wang Qiu’er, but he was afraid of the last lie. After all, only he knew about it. The cuts on his wrist had also been healed by the immense life power of his Life Gold after one night of rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Huo Yuhao’s explanation, everyone was shocked even though they hadn’t experienced it themselves. A three-way martial soul fusion skill was too dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er was slightly dazed after hearing his words. After Huo Yuhao recounted how Wang Qiu’er had saved him, and how it had led to her grave injuries, the look Wang Dong’er’s eyes changed. Her eyes were moving, as if she was thinking of something. However, she subconsciously clenched Huo Yuhao’s arm tightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After listening to Huo Yuhao, Cai Mei’er was stunned. “The two of you were too brazen. Even with your exceptional talents, he was an eight-ringed evil soul master! Even in a duel, I wasn’t able to capture him! However, the two of you thwarted his plans. What about the two Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear cubs that you talked about? Let them out! Don’t freeze them to death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao acknowledged her words and released the two cubs from his storage-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were still frozen, but Huo Yuhao could sense their thriving life through his Spiritual Detection. His Ultimate Ice wasn’t just used to hurt. It had a preservation effect which was rather strong, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pressed both hands on the two cubs and slowly retracted his ultimate ice-type aura. He also slightly activated his soul power and used his Mysterious Heaven Technique to increase their blood flow circulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two cubs stood there in a daze, but they remained immobile. Since Huo Yuhao dared to freeze them, it meant that he had considered this aspect. In the Ultimate Soldier Plan, he had taken a special lesson on cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump and exert pressure before agitating with soul power. With the control of his Spiritual Detection, Huo Yuhao restored the two cubs perfectly. Finally, they started to breathe after ten minutes. Their chests could also be seen rising and falling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two cubs looked very cute. They had just been born, and hadn’t even opened their eyes yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er said, “Yuhao, what do you plan to do with them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “If the academy needs them, we can bring them back. I believe the Beast Dueling Area should need them. After all, Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear cubs are very difficult to capture.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er didn’t stand on ceremony either. She nodded and replied, “Let’s bring them back to the academy first. However, I don’t think the Beast Dueling Area is suitable for them. With the current situation in the academy’s Beast Dueling Area, the two of them might frighten the rest of the ordinary soul beasts when they develop after a few months.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Cai Mei’er’s words, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er looked at each other. They were reminded of the time when Huo Yuhao released the aura of a hundred-thousand year soul beast and frightened the entire Beast Dueling Area. They were both amused at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan interrupted, “Let’s raise them in the inner courtyard first. Everyone will take care of them if they’re in the inner courtyard.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er nodded and said, “We can only do it this way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two cubs slowly recovered, and even started to cry. Their cries sounded rather pathetic, just like infants that were bawling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone present was the best in Shrek Academy, but none of them had helped raise Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears before! They looked at each other and didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had a bright idea and said, “The two of them must be hungry. Ah, it’s a pity that their mother has been killed. Her corpse must have been taken by those vicious evil soul masters too. Dean Cai, do you know what Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears eat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cai Mei’er was stumped by this question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “Mature Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears eat meat, but such young cubs should feed on milk, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Milk…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few guys lowered their heads, as they were afraid of causing misunderstandings if they looked at the ladies. There were many more guys than ladies on their team! Besides Dean Cai, they couldn’t offend Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo either! There was also Wang Qiu’er, whose fighting abilities had been witnessed by everyone before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a weak voice sounded, “No, they don’t feed on milk. They consume meat from the moment they’re born. Their first meal should be their mother’s placenta and umbilical cord. For such strong soul beasts, they are born with teeth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They ate meat from the moment they were born! They were indeed very strong!</span></p>

However, that was understandable, given that she had suffered such grave injuries! She was able to stand up after just one night, which demonstrated how tough she was.</span></p>
