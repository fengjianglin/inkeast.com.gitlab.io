 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged once again before leaving Elder Xuan’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t remain in the Sea God’s Pavilion, heading back to the Tang Sect. His body had just recovered, and he didn’t dare to toil the entire night. He returned to the Tang Sect and his own room, and began to meditate to recover his physical strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the morning of the second day, he ate his breakfast before Bei Bei gathered the senior management of the Tang Sect for a meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had gone to report to Elder Xuan the night before. Xu Sanshi recounted the entire journey in detail as a means of updating Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like Elder Xuan had mentioned, the Tang Sect’s Soul Tool Hall was very busy. Shrek Academy sent all their teachers and students from the Soul Tool Department to the Tang Sect, personally led by Dean Qian Duoduo. They were now all under Xuan Ziwen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Academy also sent over all types of resources, and Dean Xian Lin’er and Teacher Fan Yu led a batch of teachers from the Martial Soul Department to instruct the students of the Academy as well as the Shrek City Defense Army on the use of soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Tang Sect had already been relocated into two different areas. One of them was at the original address, while the other region was a huge factory used to manufacture soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eldest senior!” Huo Yuhao hurriedly greeted Bei Bei when he saw him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Bei Bei was unkind to him. He said, “Little junior, you aren’t allowed to perform any missions without my permission from now on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao was shocked as he looked at him. He asked, “Eldest senior, why is that so?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei ferociously banged the table and said furiously, “Before you left, what did I tell you? My words have fallen on deaf ears, haven’t they? You disregarded your own safety and took such a huge risk. How dare you still ask me why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugh…” Huo Yuhao suddenly looked very embarrassed. He scratched his head and looked at Xu Sanshi helplessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi chuckled and said, “Yuhao, don’t look at me. You were injured earlier, such that I couldn’t bear to reprimand you. Did you really think I couldn’t tell what you were planning? I was fooled by you at the start. After that, I realized that the door that you left behind was supposed to be used to return back to the base, am I right? This means that you didn’t stand a chance at all. If not for the power that Di Tian left in your body, you would have been dead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eldest senior is right. Don’t go out and perform any missions anymore. Remain in the sect and focus on your cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a disgruntled look on his face, “Third senior, you can’t put it that way. I was forced by circumstances then, wasn’t I? If I didn’t help the Star Luo Empire achieve a decisive victory, the Sun Moon Empire would have run riot in the Heavenly Soul Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei just looked very cold. “All right, there’s no use in saying all of that. Sit down. Whatever it is, you won’t be allowed to leave Shrek City without my permission. Otherwise, you’ll be expelled from the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was normally very refined and very nice in his treatment of the members of Shrek’s Seven Monsters. This was especially true for Huo Yuhao. This was his first time he had lost his temper against Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was instantly very afraid and didn’t dare to argue back. He could only sit down in disappointment, and appear very helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was sitting beside him and started to secretly laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was frustrated as he glanced at her. He asked, “Is it that funny?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu chortled, “You deserve it. Who asked you to lose your cool? We support eldest senior’s punishment of you. Just remain in the sect and cultivate.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Bei Bei said, “During these last few days that you weren’t around, the Tang Sect has already started to move on all fronts. According to Elder Xuan’s instructions, what we need to do first is equip an army that is capable of resisting the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions. The members of this army will be formed by the teachers and outstanding students of the Academy. I’m going to repeat the plan now, and we’ll see if anyone has anything to add.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Academy has considered the opinions of all parties after a conference. They’ve decided to set up three soul engineer legions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three? Huo Yuhao was rather shocked when he heard that number. If they were like the Sun Moon Empire, each soul engineer legion would be composed of five hundred people. This meant that equipping three soul engineer legions would mean equipping fifteen hundred people. How easy was it to create enough equipment for fifteen hundred people to use? Furthermore, the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions were strong in the sense that their soul tool technologies were leading the entire continent. Formations of soul tools and linked soul tools were some things that the Tang Sect lacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why were there so few casualties from the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineer legions when they fought? Hundreds of the Sun Moon Empire’s soul engineers unleashed linked soul tools, creating a line of defense that even Transcendent Douluo were helpless against!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t it a little too hasty for the Academy to set up three soul engineer legions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei glanced at Huo Yuhao and saw how astonished he was. An intense smile flashed across his face. However, he soon returned to his cold and indifferent look and he continued, “Out of these three soul engineer legions, the first legion will be called the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion. The Academy approved this name. It’ll be the most elite legion out of the three, consisting of two hundred soul engineers. They’ll all be equipped with the most advanced technologies that the Tang Sect possesses right now, and all the soul engineers will at least be Soul Emperors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The leader of this legion will be Dean Xian Lin’er, and the vice-leader of this legion will be Dean Qian Duoduo. At the same time, there’ll be ten Titled Douluo in this legion, all from the Academy. However, Dean Xian Lin’er will be the only Transcendent Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hundred? That’s still rather reliable.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a slight sigh of relief when he heard that. However, his eyes popped wide when he heard ‘ten Titled Douluo’!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten Titled Douluo! Even the Sun Moon Empire’s Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Legion, the strongest out of the Hand that Protects the Nation, didn’t have so many Titled Douluo! Moreover, all the soul engineers from this legion would at least be Soul Emperors, even though there were only two hundred of them. It really seemed like they wanted to create the number one soul engineer legion on the continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “Currently, we’ve decided to equip this soul engineer legion with custom-made soul tools, including the newly-created batch of linked soul tools. Teacher Xuan will also personally supervise and participate in the creation of core parts of all equipment. We’ve predicted that we’ll be able to fully equip all of them with half a year to a year’s time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted his hand and said, “Eldest senior, I have a question.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei glanced at him and said, “What’s the question?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Given the Tang Sect’s current abilities, there shouldn’t be no problem creating soul tools for Soul Emperors. In terms of linked soul tools, we shouldn’t have a problem either, since we have Teacher Xuan. However, Soul Emperors should only be a small part of this soul engineer legion. Soul Sages, Soul Douluo, and Titled Douluo will make up the large bulk of this soul engineer legion. The soul tools that they will be using should be even more advanced, otherwise, they won’t be effective enough! Do we have the ability to create so many advanced soul tools?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei nodded and thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder he’s our little junior. He managed to find the core of the problem so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your question is very good. Yes, we won’t be able to create so many suitable soul tools given our current abilities. This is why, after much discussion, we’ve decided that the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion will be composed entirely of close-combat soul engineers. For all the soul tools we are going to manufacture, we’ve decided to focus on those that increase speed and offensive strength. Secondarily, they’ll be tailored to increase survivability on the battlefield. The only linked soul tool will be for mass defense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his words, Huo Yuhao was immediately enlightened. At the same time, his eyes brightened.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s a great idea, isn’t it? What are the soul masters from Shrek Academy most adept at? It’s the way they fight. In the entire continent, Shrek Academy is the best in this aspect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since that’s the case, why would we focus on long-range attacks? Close-combat soul engineers, increasing speed, offensive strength, and survivability. If we can achieve all these, we would naturally increase the fighting strength of our soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If that’s the case, that’s great then. Eldest senior, you can continue.” Huo Yuhao was in awe as he looked at Bei Bei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei glared at him unkindly and continued, saying, “For the other two soul engineer legions, there will be more people. The first of the other two soul engineer legions will be called the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion. They’ll be equipped with the most advanced Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons. They’ll be given three hundred of them, of varying classes. There’ll be a total of one thousand soul masters in the legion. Our aim is to ensure the agility of our heavy cannons as we increase our firepower, and also to ensure that the soul engineers wielding these cannons will be able to get into formations at the quickest speed under any condition and at any place.&nbsp;</span></p>

Some of them have even secretly been imported from the Sun Moon Empire. In addition, we are also manufacturing our own cannon shells.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion. It was much simpler to equip such a soul engineer legion. The Tang Sect had already been producing Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons, and thus had an increasing stock of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the stronger a cannon was, the less portable it was. How could they ensure that they could move the cannons as quickly as possible? Furthermore, they still had to preserve the fighting strength of the cannons. What they needed were sufficient Sealed Milk Bottles to support these cannons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wait, one thousand people and three hundred cannons? It seems like eldest senior is trying to use people to make up for the lack of Sealed Milk Bottles? After all, every soul master is a source of energy. If they take turns pouring soul power into the Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons, they should be able to attack continuously for some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If three hundred Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons are fired at the same time, they would unleash terrifying strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could still clearly remember that Zhuge Divine Crossbow Cannons had played a very critical role in Shrek City when the Beast Wave came.</span></p>
