They strongly condemned the indiscriminately murderous mission issued by the Illustrious Virtue Hall, and also firmly stated that they had nothing to do with the incident. They then stated that whoever dared to exact revenge on them would have to bear the consequences of their actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, regardless of what the Body Sect said, their standing on the continent had increased greatly. They now seemed even more powerful than Shrek Academy or the Illustrious Virtuous Hall, and appeared to be the top power on the continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao only learned of these things when he woke up. He slept for four days straight before finally waking up in the infirmary. It hadn’t been an act; he’d truly been asleep the entire time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when he woke up, Huo Yuhao felt an odd sensation. It was as if a door in his spiritual world had been opened, as his mind was unusually clear compared to before. His understanding of previously-blurry profound concepts of Necromancy had also improved greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Electrolux was asleep when he woke up, as was the Snow Empress. The Ice Empress and Skydream told Huo Yuhao that the Snow Empress’ seal had been completed, but that her power could only be unsealed once Huo Yuhao had achieved the level of a Soul Sage. In her sleep, the Snow Empress was trying to regain her spiritual awareness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything else appeared to be normal. Huo Yuhao hadn’t become stronger because of the Snow Empress’ successful sealing, but he looked forward to the moment that he would ‘evolve’ like Electrolux had said. How would the Snow Empress fuse with him? What would the evolution reject? If not for the fact that Electrolux was asleep, he would’ve demanded an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The internal chaos within the Illustrious Virtue Hall had nothing to do with Huo Yuhao. However, he was still extremely worried when he woke up. After all, the huge starlight sapphire storage-type soul tool and the giant metal figure were both still inside his storage-type soul tool! He didn’t even have to think to know their significance to the Illustrious Virtue Hall. They’d definitely spare no effort to find them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was extremely worried that they’d search everyone’s storage-type soul tools. If that happened, there was nowhere he could hide them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m fine now. Can I return to my dormitory?” Huo Yuhao asked the doctor on duty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The doctor checked his body, nodded his head, and said, “It seems you really are fine. Strange, your brain doesn’t appear to have suffered any trauma, so why were you out for so long?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao grimaced and replied, “I don’t know either. Teacher, can I ask what happened that day? How could anyone have the guts to attack the Illustrious Virtue Hall?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shh.” The doctor quickly shushed him and placed a finger to his lips. He then said in a low voice, “We can’t discuss it. The Hallmaster has issued a gag-order. The entire school is feeling jittery, and none of the students or teachers are permitted to leave the school right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone has to undergo interrogation. If not for the fact that you were unconscious, you would’ve been interrogated too. I’ll inform my superiors now that you’ve recovered from your wounds. You can only return to your dormitory once you’ve been questioned. Wait here, I’ll go inform someone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thing he feared the most had come true. Huo Yuhao became noticeably more tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What can I do?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;As Huo Yuhao tensed up, his brain began to spin rapidly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The interrogation could be either light or severe,” Huo Yuhao told himself, “I have to consider the worst-case scenario.” At that moment, he took note of his surroundings and then acted immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The doctor soon returned with a strict-looking teacher in tow. Huo Yuhao thought he recognized from the Illustrious Virtue Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your name is Huo Yuhao?” The teacher asked coldly as he took out a register.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re from Shrek Academy?” The teacher continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“On the day that the Illustrious Virtue Hall was attacked, what did you see? What were you doing?” When the teacher asked this question, he waved his hand at the doctor, signalling for him to leave them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some thought, Huo Yuhao replied, “That day, I was in the middle of making a soul tool. Just as I finished up one of the component, there was a huge explosion. I’m a spirit-type soul master, thus I have a very astute sense of danger. The moment I sensed that something was amiss, I immediately hid underneath the table. I heard an explosion from outside, while the following terrifying soul power shockwave prevented me from venturing outside. After the battle outside had quieted down, I snuck a peak, and then ran to the side of the Illustrious Virtue Hall. Then, I felt a strong force strike me, then I blacked out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was able to avoid lying as he answered. What he’d said was the truth of the matter. While he didn’t know if they’d survived the battle, he did knew that there were surveillance type soul tools in the underground facility of the Illustrious Virtue hall. There was no point in arousing the other’s suspicions for a few meaningless details.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After he heard what Huo Yuhao had said, the teacher nodded his head and said, “Anything else? For example, did you discover anything special?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head with a blank look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the Ultimate Soldier Plan, they had undergone intensive interrogation training. When he answered these questions, Huo Yuhao’s heart rate and tone were all perfectly normal. Even his eyes didn’t give him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The teacher stared at him carefully for a while before slowly shaking his head. He took out a metal stick from the storage-type soul tool on his wrist, and then said, “I have to do a complete sweep of you. Please put all of your soul tools into a storage-type soul tool. When you’re done, pass them to me. You can’t leave anything out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression turned dark and he replied, “Sorry, teacher, but I have a right to my privacy. I can’t let you search them. I’m an exchange student from Shrek Academy. Even if I’m just an ordinary student here, you have no right to search me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The teacher chuckled coldly and replied, “No right? Don’t forget our school’s name: ‘The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.’ We fall under direct imperial jurisdiction. As such, all of our students have sworn loyalty to the imperial family, and our management is semi-military. This is a personal order from His Majesty. Anyone who refuses to be interrogated and searched shall be dealt with as a traitor. I don’t care where you’re from, but since you were in our school at the time of the incident, you must be searched thoroughly. The fact that we didn’t search you while you were recovering is already a gesture to preserve your dignity.”</span></p>
