 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi mumbled, “I regret it. Yes, I regret it. Only in that moment when I lost my child did I realize that revenge isn’t the first priority in my heart. When a person truly falls in love with another, that person can forget about his or her revenge. If I could make that choice again, I would have made a different one. I’m sorry, Yuhao, it’s my fault.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned. His heart ached agonizingly as he listened to Ju Zi’s words, but they both knew that there was nothing in the world that could reverse their regrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao patted Ju Zi’s back gently before he struggled out from her embrace. He heaved a faint sigh, but said nothing more as he turned to walk out. He had already decided, but he was also looking back because of Ju Zi’s words. Her words made him feel a little uncomfortable, but…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daddy, hug!” That babyish call stopped him once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around, and glanced warmly at little Yunhan in Ju Zi’s arms. “Be good, Yunhan. You have to listen to your mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Yunhan opened his arms. “Daddy, hug…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s voice was trembling. “You should hug him one more time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hesitated, but finally walked back in front of Ju Zi and took little Yunhan into his arms. For some reason, this little baby’s cries seemed to touch something in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hugged little Yunhan, and the baby naturally planted his tender cheeks on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. That appearance was exceptionally cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao patted his back softly, and his eyes became increasingly warm and gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi began to cry even more uncontrollably when she saw that. She truly hoped that time would just freeze in this moment, that this moment would never change!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the child was finally returned to her arms, and she didn’t even know how Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Little Yunhan fell asleep in her arms. He was sleeping very soundly; this little fellow had always been very adaptable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s lips trembled as she repeated the same sentence to herself. “He… is actually… your…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong snuck out of the Sun Moon Empire’s royal place. If Xu Tianran found out that somebody could enter and exit his royal palace at a whim like this place was uninhabited, who knew what he would think?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, that was also because Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong came in just for a spin, and they weren’t executing any actual plans. Certain especially sensitive and powerful soul masters could discover them as soon as they could sense hostility and murderousness. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong maintained their cool from the beginning to the end, and that was one of the most important reasons why they could enter and leave so peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t expect you to like that child so much.” Tang Wutong whispered softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned around as he gently caressed her long hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re jealous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head and said, “No, I’m not. Since she’s missed her chance, then that chance will not come back again, not unless time begins to flow backwards. Otherwise, you can only be mine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed. Even though Tang Wutong said she wasn’t jealous, was she really not?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s next statement expressed her mentality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will definitely bear a son for us in the future,” Tang Wutong said resolutely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled. “That needs to happen. But I will love our child all the same whether we have a son or a daughter, and I will love them like I love you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong pouted obstinately. “You have to love me the most!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao guffawed. “Why are you competing with our child?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They left Radiant City and flew into the air once more. They went back and forth between Radiant City and the Ming Dou Mountain Range within two days. Only they could bear such a burden with their Class 9 flying-type soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s face gradually became solemn as they raced through the sky. “Yuhao, how do we account for this matter when we return? I think they might complain to the academy. If they accuse you of collaborating with the enemy…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head. “They won’t, they’re not so foolish. I was using Spiritual Detection over the main peak when we left, and I stopped only when we left its range. They had no intention to chase us, and this means we won’t run into much trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These Titled Douluo all have their own statuses and identities. Do you think they were very willing to capture little Yunhan? The truth is, no one there felt comfortable in their hearts, including the White Tiger Duke. What we have done simply helped them make that decision. Besides, what good will accusing me of treason to the academy be for them? We have already displayed sufficient strength. Furthermore, the academy has always protected their incumbents, and the Titled Douluo know that too. The war is about to start up again, while the Douluo Continent’s three native empires are hoping that we’ll help them fight against the Sun Moon Empire. If I were them, pretending this matter never happened is the best outcome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stared at Huo Yuhao with slightly dazed eyes. “You have already thought about all this long ago?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head. “No, but I can still make a rough judgment. Face and dignity is very important for Titled Douluo. Furthermore, the strength that we have displayed is sufficient for them to pay attention to us. They will need reconnaissance skills like mine in the war to come. I think the Dou Ling Empire and the Heavenly Soul Empire’s Titled Douluo have already left, so let’s go back to the Ming Dou Mountain Range for a bit, and we can prove our hypothesis. We can also pass on the news that the Sun Moon Empire has gathered its armies, and consider that making up for our transgressions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong heaved a sigh. “Won’t they think that the Sun Moon Empire is gathering their armies because we have returned the crown prince?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chuckled and said, “Do girls become stupid when they get jealous? Silly girl, why do you ask such silly questions? First, the White Tiger Duke cannot make an erroneous judgment like that with his intelligence. How can the Douluo Continent’s three native empires not know that Xu Tianran was making sacrifices so that he could restart the invasion? Their attempt to assassinate Xu Tianran was meant to stop this invasion from happening!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong hit him gently and said, “You’re the one who has become stupid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was dusk when they returned to the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had travelled several thousand kilometers back and forth over two days, and they also had to avoid the aerial surveillance soul tools in their way. They were even engaged in battle. Both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were extremely spent, despite their cultivation ranks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They landed outside the White Tiger Duke’s tent. Huo Yuhao used Spiritual Detection and quickly found the Duke, who was still dealing with military matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be safe, Huo Yuhao didn’t go to see the White Tiger Duke directly. He used his concrete-immaterial spiritual power to conjure a projection to enter the White Tiger Duke’s tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was still dealing with military matters that were coming in from everywhere. He had assumed control over the entire Western and Northwestern Field Armies, and could be called the number-one man in the Star Luo Empire’s military. He had status, reputation, and was widely respected, while he controlled more than half of the Star Luo Empire’s armies. He was probably the most powerful man beneath the emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke seemed to feel something as he suddenly raised his head. He saw a shadow appear not too far from him, though it didn’t make any sound at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was startled, but he was Commander of the Three Armies, and his heart and mind were very calm. He identified the visitor after his initial astonishment, and heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lord Duke.” Huo Yuhao bowed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke’s expression immediately turned black. “You dare to come back. Are you aware that what you have done means a dozen Titled Douluo have achieved nothing in their mission?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said plainly, “I am simply doing what I think is right. Duke, did you not think that there was something wrong with the plan? I will tell you the same thing. Kidnapping the crown prince doesn’t achieve anything unless Xu Tianran is also dead. I have also proven this point when I was back in Radiant City before this. The Sun Moon Empire has already begun mustering their armies, and they will probably invade very soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke was momentarily stunned. “You returned him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke sighed and said, “So be it. At least I’ll feel a little better. The Heavenly Sun Douluo has said that this will be the end of this matter, and we shall pretend that this mission never happened. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly and answered, “I wasn’t worried about much in the first place. But I still have to thank you, and the Heavenly Sun Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke said, “You can say that to him yourself when you see him again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued, “The Sun Moon Empire’s armies have already been assembled. I’m afraid they will launch an all-out invasion in half a month to a month. I don’t know if their target is the Heavenly Soul Empire, or if they’re going for the Star Luo Empire. Therefore, you have to be more careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke frowned and said, “The Heavenly Soul Empire is on the brink of annihilation, but the truth is, the Star Luo Empire is also faced with a great impending calamity! The Sun Moon Empire’s invasion means the Heavenly Soul Empire is in danger, but we aren’t that much better.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao fell silent. He knew what the White Tiger Duke was talking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Soul Empire’s situation was the worst for the moment, as two-thirds of their territory had been conquered. The Star Luo Empire seemed prepared, and their armies seemed ready. They had a hundred thousand soldiers along the border, and they even had a natural stronghold like the Ming Dou Mountain Range to fortify.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But was all that really the truth?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire had conquered much of the Heavenly Soul Empire’s territory, and part of that territory was where the Heavenly Soul Empire had bordered the Star Luo Empire. Even though it was a hilly area, the ground was a lot flatter there compared to the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the Sun Moon Empire wanted to attack the Star Luo Empire, they would naturally launch an invasion from that side. The Sun Moon Empire could attack both the Heavenly Soul Empire and the Star Luo Empire, and both parties would find it incredibly difficult to defend themselves even if they gave everything they had, no matter which side the Sun Moon Empire chose to attack first.</span></p>
