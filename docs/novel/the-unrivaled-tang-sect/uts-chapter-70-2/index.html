 <p><strong>Book 11: The Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 70.2: Flying-type Soul Tool</strong></p>
 <p>With the Haodong Power circulating through their bodies, their flight speed wasn’t one whit inferior to that of Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, or He Caitou’s. Unlike Xiao Xiao, who had a rope tied to her waist—which made her look like a kite as she was pulled along by Ma Xiaotao—they were able to fly by themselves.</p>
 <p>The others were occasionally able to faintly see a faint golden light momentarily appear on Wang Dong’s body. Afterwards, that faint golden light would gradually flow from his body to Huo Yuhao’s.</p>
 <p>----</p>
 <p>They were able to fly a total of five hundred miles in two hours, but this was their limit, due to the outer courtyard disciples with relatively lower cultivation levels. However, Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had actually been able to persist without the assistance of any outside parties, much to the surprise of the inner courtyard disciples.</p>
 <p>Due to their earlier hold-up, the sky had already begun to dim by the time that they landed to rest.</p>
 <p>“This isn’t good; we won’t make it in time. This old man will carry you guys for a while.” Elder Xuan’s voice rang out as his leisurely figure materialized from the nearby forest, as if he’d instantaneously teleported there.</p>
 <p>“However, before we set off, I’m a bit hungry. You guys should know what to do!” Elder Xuan walked over to Huo Yuhao with a smile on his face, then patted his shoulder with a somewhat encouraging look.</p>
 <p>This time around, they didn’t need Elder Xuan to divide them up. Everyone immediately took up their positions, while the cook, Huo Yuhao, had to enter the limelight again before he’d even had the chance to recover his soul power.</p>
 <p>Besides the Haodong Power, a large reason that he and Wang Dong had been able to last for two hours was due to the latter’s Golden Light left arm bone. If it weren’t for the fact that they’d been able to continuously recover their soul power throughout the journey, they would’ve been exhausted already.</p>
 <p>They weren’t able to find any fish for dinner, but the smell of wild game couldn’t be any easier for them to track. Combined with a few mountain berries and bamboo shoots, they once again enjoyed another sumptuous meal. The inner courtyard disciples were so pleased that they praised Huo Yuhao incessantly; with Huo Yuhao present, it was practically like they were on vacation.</p>
 <p>It took another two hours for them to finish dinner, and it also took quite a while for everyone to recover their soul power afterwards. The sky had already turned dark by the time that everyone had fully recovered. Fortunately, the stars lit up the evening sky, so their sight wasn’t impeded.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was the person least affected by the darkness. With the visual acuity his Spirit Eyes granted him, there wasn’t much difference between nighttime and daytime to him.</p>
 <p>“Here, fasten this to your waist.” Wang Yan passed a long length of rope to Huo Yuhao. The rope had a specialised lock fashioned to one end of it, such that it could be fastened to a person’s waist and thigh. The entire rope was over thirty meters long.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao took the rope and fastened it to himself. He already knew that a rope such as this was meant to be used alongside a flying-type soul tool. When there were soul masters with different cultivation levels, using a rope like this would allow the soul master with the higher cultivation level to take the one with a lower cultivation level along with them, so as to increase the joint distance flown by the two people, thus allowing the two to maintain a quicker flying speed.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only person to receive a rope; everyone else did as well, including Wang Yan. Once everyone had received a rope, the ends to all of them were handed to Elder Xuan.</p>
 <p>“Little fellas, you’ll have to do your best to protect yourselves in a bit. Once we ascend, everyone should maintain a forwards-facing position. Once I give you the signal, activate your soul power to prevent yourselves from being injured by the turbulence around us. Understood?”</p>
 <p>“Understood.”</p>
 <p><em>Elder Xuan’s going to make a move?</em> Huo Yuhao’s mind shook. He Caitou, who was behind him, rose into the air with him in tow.</p>
 <p>Nobody could see what Elder Xuan had done, but a flying-type soul tool that was half as thick as Huo Yuhao and He Caitou’s had appeared on his back. A set of dark-red wings quickly unfurled until they were about two meters or so wide, which wasn’t considered too wide. However, there were twelve thrusters on the ends of his wings. It had to be known that the militarised versions of the flying-type soul tools, along with even Huo Yuhao and He Caitou’s ones, only had two thrusters! Just what sort of flying-type soul tool was this?</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao quickly understood what these twelve thrusters signified. Once everyone had gotten into a forwards-facing position in the air, Elder Xuan’s voice rang out, “Is everyone ready? Three, two, one, let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Following Elder Xuan’s shout, all twelve thrusters on his wings simultaneously burst into life with blazing white light. Immediately afterwards, Huo Yuhao felt a large burst of force at his waist. Due to the enormous tension acting on him, the wings on his back automatically slightly withdrew. Afterwards, he wasn’t able to clearly see his surroundings anymore.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the ear-piercing whistles coming from the turbulence around him affected his hearing. After only a few short seconds, he found it somewhat intolerable. Merely relying on his soul power to protect his body didn’t seem to be sufficient anymore.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was still holding on to his legs from below, but he wasn’t in a much better condition either. Their Haodong Power circulated at high speed through their bodies, while the golden-reddish color coming from his left arm flickered unceasingly as it protected his own body.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to be negligent; he immediately released the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, which caused a resplendent layer of crystalline diamonds to cover the surface of his body. This was the Ice Empress’ Armor.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the pressure that had envelop him immediately lessened the moment that he activated the Ice Empress’ Armor. Huo Yuhao also tried to release his Spiritual Detection in order to check his surroundings, but to quickly discovered, to his astonishment, that he wasn’t able to release his soul skill more than a foot away from him.</p>
 <p>This… just what was going on?</p>
 <p>“You’re travelling too quickly. As such, your spiritual power is being severed and scattered the moment it leaves your body. Be a bit more obedient and don’t try to do anything else. That human’s really strong.” The Skydream Iceworm gave Huo Yuhao a timely reminder.</p>
 <p>The Ice Empress was somewhat unresigned. “He wouldn’t even be my opponent if it was the previous me.”</p>
 <p>The Skydream Iceworm immediately changed his tone and said, “That’s because my Bing Bing is awesome!”</p>
 <p>“Shut up!”</p>
 <p>As he was only using a defensive soul skill, the drain on his soul power wasn’t too large. After using the Ice Empress’ Armor for a period of time, Huo Yuhao switched over to a Class 2 Soul Shield, which had a decent amount of defensive capabilities. At the very least, there wouldn’t be any problems with it protecting his body from the turbulent wind.</p>
 <p>The pinnacle level of speed that Elder Xuan was travelling at made Huo Yuhao made it so that he was only able to sense a patch of pitch-blackness. Even raising his head to see the stars and moonlight was impossible. As a result, he could only do his best to protect himself. This was Elder Xuan’s strength! Anybody could remain in equilibrium in mid-air using a flying-type soul tool, and the air didn’t normally have much resistance at all. However, Elder Xuan was actually able to travel at such a terrifying speed by himself with so many people in tow! Just how could this be explained using the word ‘strength’ alone?</p>
 <p>Previously, they’d travelled around four to five hundred miles in a timespan of two hours. Now, if they were to travel for two entire hours, would they really just stop at a thousand miles?</p>
