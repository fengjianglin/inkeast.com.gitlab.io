 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dense vegetation that had previously burst with surging green light all wilted, as if their vitality had been sucked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right when the Jade Ocean Spirit Ape was turning to run, a golden patch of light suddenly glowed on the ground in front of it. The golden radiance wasn’t that brilliant, but it was filled with the gentle power of light. There was another golden hexagram on the ground, but it wasn’t very conspicuous, as it was covered by all the vegetation. However, it was quite large, with a diameter of around three meters, so it extended horizontally across quite a large area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Ape was escaping in a panic. Even though it saw the golden hexagram, it didn’t feel any threat from it, so it leapt forward in an attempt to jump right over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as it was in midair, the hexagram was triggered. A similar golden pillar surged into the sky and completely enveloped the Jade Ocean Spirit Ape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Ape was propelled at least three meters into the air by this pillar of light. The intense golden light fixed it in place in the air and completely immobilized it, while scorching golden flames incinerated its body. The ape howled painfully and desperately as it struggled as hard as it could, and layer after layer of green soul power undulations flowed from its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s black fourth soul ring was glowing; this was her fourth soul skill, Hexagram Array.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hexagram Array was remarkably powerful. Anything that it struck would immediately be trapped by the power of light contained within, and would have to withstand intense searing fire from the pillar of light. The only way to resist the fire was to continually release soul power, as one couldn’t use any soul skills at all once struck by the Hexagram Array; all one could do was release soul power to fight against it. This would naturally consume a lot of soul power, and the duration was closely related to the target’s cultivation. However, if the target’s cultivation was within two ranks, the shortest duration of the trap would still be at least three seconds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a powerful offensive soul skill and a formidable controlling soul skill at the same time. It trapped and hurt the opponent, and it greatly consumed the opponent’s soul power! Truly a forceful and well-rounded soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this soul skill naturally had its weaknesses amidst all of its strengths. There could only be one active Hexagram Array at any one point in time, and the array had a one second delay to take effect after it had been unleashed. The target also had to cross over it for it to take effect. The limitations rendered this powerful soul skill not so excessively terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Jade Ocean Spirit Ape obviously didn’t know that the seemingly unthreatening Hexagram Array would be this potent, or that it would have to fight for dear life inside Wang Dong’s fourth soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er had already descended again from the sky, and he had already swapped positions with Wang Dong’er in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s bluish-golden wings became completely golden, and plunged from the sky like two giant scythes. Her wings crossed one another continuously as they slashed the immobilized Spirit Ape, and it was hurled into the sky once more as it howled in excruciating pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The original Hexagram Array instantly vanished, and another Hexagram Array glowed in the spot where the Spirit Ape would land after it was hurtled away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one second that the Hexagram Array required had already passed when the Spirit Ape crashed heavily to the ground. It was thrown into the air once more, and torched by the fire of light yet again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er had rarely launched attacks ever since she reunited with Huo Yuhao, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t powerful enough. It simply meant she gave Huo Yuhao more chances to perform. She was willing to be the woman behind his limelight, while the reason why she took the initiative this time was to put on a display for a certain someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Hexagram Arrays that came one after another, in addition to the mighty slashing wing-blades boosted by her Golden Light Left Arm Bone, severely wounded the Jade Ocean Spirit Ape. The green light that the ape released while it was being scorched within the Hexagram Array was a lot dimmer than before, and two huge gashes crossed both of its shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er exclaimed as she extended her wings, and she bounced off Huo Yuhao’s palms, which were stretched out to give her a boost. She flew about six or seven meters into the sky, and searing bluish-golden flames lit up on her. In the next moment, her fifth soul ring began to glow and she phased into an elegant and graceful bluish-golden butterfly for a single instant. The area for several hundred meters all around her was painted with bluish-gold hues when she unleashed her attack, as if there were countless bluish-gold butterflies flickering in the sky. Wang Dong’er had already finished her soul skill even as everyone saw a blinding flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was clearly a shock-type offensive soul skill, but Wang Dong’er was simply too fast. The bluish-gold light only seemed to flash once, and she was behind the Spirit Ape in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hexagram Array’s light was instantly withdrawn as the Jade Ocean Spirit Ape plummeted from the sky. It was still trembling vigorously, and everyone could clearly see that it had multiple bluish-golden light patterns plastered all over its body… or, one could describe them as wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quickly, Mo Xuan!” Zhang Lexuan shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Xuan wouldn’t let an opportunity like this slip away. He darted out with a flash, and arrived before the Jade Ocean Spirit Ape as Zhang Lexuan followed behind him and gave it a final blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Ape’s life force was reaching its end, and it felt as if the power of light was forcibly maintaining its last breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Butterfly Goddess’ Meteor, Wang Dong’er’s fearsome fifth soul skill. Its offensive power was so strong that even Cai Mei’er, who was watching the battle from the side, reacted in shock. The air was filled with the smell of sunshine that was created after everything was incinerated by the fiery light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black soul ring rose from the Jade Ocean Spirit Ape’s body, and Mo Xuan immediately sat down cross-legged beside it without hesitation. He began to absorb the soul ring with the guidance of his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone naturally surrounded him for protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan turned to look at Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er, and then at Wang Qiu’er, who had done nothing at all except punching out with that one fist. She frowned delicately and said, “I’ll have to criticize you first, Yuhao. You’re the main control-type soul master… how did you lead your companions? Why didn’t Wang Qiu’er truly participate in the battle from beginning to end? While it’s true that you and Wang Dong’er were enough to defeat this Jade Ocean Spirit Ape, wouldn’t Qiu’er’s participation have made it a lot easier, and you would have expended a lot less soul power?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er didn’t even wait for Huo Yuhao to respond. She exclaimed unhappily, “We don’t know what she can do, and neither do we know what soul skills she possesses or how powerful she is. What if she drags us down when we delegate something to her and ask her to cooperate? Furthermore, we are also concerned about her safety!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan’s expression grew dark. “Do you know what being on a team means, Wang Dong’er? If everyone on the team shares your opinion, then the team will crumble sooner or later. You’re also from the inner courtyard, and you’re Elder Mu’s disciple, don’t you understand simple reason? Our fight has only just begun, and what we need right now is mutual cooperation and understanding. I don’t care about what problems you have with Wang Qiu’er, but you can’t act on them on this expedition, as everyone’s safety is concerned! From now on, you will temporarily stop your coordination with Huo Yuhao. You will stand guard at the back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light flashed across Wang Dong’er’s eyes, and she wanted to continue arguing, but Huo Yuhao held her back. Huo Yuhao muttered softly, “Eldest senior sister is right. We are a team, and we are one body. It’s my fault, eldest senior sister.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er also calmed down at this moment. She knew that Zhang Lexuan was right, but she said nothing more even though she still felt a little aggrieved and unconvinced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan’s eyes turned towards Wang Qiu’er, and her voice was clearly harsher. “What about you, Wang Qiu’er? What did you do? Why didn’t you take the initiative to cooperate? It’s understandable why you fell behind in the beginning, but you could have caught up when Wang Dong’er released the first Hexagram Array. Why did you stop? The three of you are working together, do you even have a single inkling of cooperation? You were cowering at the back as you watched your comrades fight. Are you even worthy of becoming part of Shrek Academy’s inner courtyard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er shot her a glare and said coldly, “You are not qualified to decide whether I’m part of the inner courtyard or not. Why do I have to fight if the two of them are enough? It would even have been enough if I had been by myself. Furthermore, I have never cowered in the face of an adversary. If you don’t believe that, we can switch positions, and I’ll take point.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eldest senior sister’s awe-inspiring aura had been challenged, and the other inner courtyard students were stunned as they looked on, slack-jawed. They had never ever seen anyone talk back to Zhang Lexuan like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan smiled plainly and said, “I’m sorry, but I am actually qualified to decide whether you’re part of Shrek Academy’s inner courtyard. I’m part of Shrek Academy’s Sea God’s Pavilion, and I have the right to ask to the academy to expel any member from the inner courtyard. What you have done violates school rules, so nobody will protect you. If you are unconvinced about my ability, you can challenge me after the expedition. But I am the team leader for now, and I will give you one last chance. Answer me: are you willing to follow my orders and cooperate with the team?”</span></p>

Everyone else was looking at her. Nobody expected that Wang Qiu’er, who was still new, would dare to antagonize their eldest senior sister, who was the team leader. This was the Great Star Dou Forest’s inner region, and Zhang Lexuan’s actions were indisputable. She had to ensure that the team had only one voice, and that everyone would listen to her commands and her delegations. That was the only way for her to ensure everyone’s safety.</span></p>

I will listen to your orders.”</span></p>
