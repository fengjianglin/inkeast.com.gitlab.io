 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

The Heavenly Dragon Horse and Ruby Soft Tendon Python were very weak. They didn’t experience any changes, and their soul power undulations couldn’t really be felt before the fusions were completed. They only revealed their strength after their fusions were completed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Golden Tortoise experienced abnormal changes the moment Xu Sanshi started to fuse with its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tortoise exuded concentrated golden light from its body, which surged towards Xu Sanshi and started to fuse with him. However, a wave of strong life aura suddenly surged from the Golden Tortoise. Its shell didn’t turn illusory as a result of the fusion. Instead, it became more and more real. Streaks of strong golden light filled with a strong life aura were released from its shell. Every ridge on its shell was shining with golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao focused his gaze and subconsciously lifted his right hand. If something was amiss, he would immediately end this Spirit Transmission and kill the Golden Tortoise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Xu Sanshi waved his hand at him, signaling that things were fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Huo Yuhao was very adept at Spirit Transmission, he wasn’t the one undergoing the process right now. Xu Sanshi was very surprised by the sudden changes, but he could sense that the Golden Tortoise was completely willing to fuse with him. Furthermore, this sudden, strong life aura was only beneficial to him. There weren’t any drawbacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout this entire process, he clearly felt that the strength of his Xuanwu blood lineage was stabilizing. It was even rising continuously. This meant that the blood lineage of the Golden Tortoise was extremely compatible with him. This was what every soul master desired. How could he bear it if the process were interrupted?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tortoise also glanced at Huo Yuhao. However, it seemed to be in pain, and immediately shut its eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The life aura was simply too strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a buzz sounded, and the entire Spirit Transmission Hall shook slightly. Following this, the Eye of Destiny on Huo Yuhao’s forehead opened on its own. A streak of jade-green light was instantly released from his Eye of Destiny and drifted above the Golden Tortoise’s shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, jade-green light shone brightly, and the strong life aura in the air surged towards a small carving blade that was shining with jade-green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a situation that no one had expected, including Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Life Guardian Blade appeared on its own to absorb the strong life energy. What did this mean?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he had nourished his Life Guardian Blade for a long time, Huo Yuhao was very familiar with it now. There was an immense and pure life energy contained within his Life Gold. It had always been scornful of other external energies. Even if it absorbed the life energy of certain matter, that life energy would dissipate on its own and wouldn’t fuse with its origin energy. &nbsp;It was proud, or perhaps picky. It was as if there wasn’t any life force in this world that could satisfy it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, something surprising happened today. When Xu Sanshi was undergoing his Spirit Transmission, the life energy that surged from the Golden Tortoise’s body was actually absorbed by it. In addition, Huo Yuhao could sense that this was a pure absorption and assimilation. The life energy it had just absorbed wasn’t going to dissipate after being absorbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did this mean that the Golden Tortoise possessed life energy that was of the same tier as Huo Yuhao’s Life Gold? However, why was this Golden Tortoise’s life energy so weak that it was even on the verge of death if this was the case? This was extremely difficult to comprehend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly, the Golden Tortoise’s life aura became less intense after it was devoured by Huo Yuhao’s Life Guardian Blade. However, its body started to expand, and a stronger life aura started to surge out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade-green light from the Life Guardian Blade also became stronger and stronger as it absorbed that pure life energy. Huo Yuhao’s body also received some feedback. As the life energy permeated through him, he felt extremely restrained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Streaks of light surged out from his body, turning into three projections. They were the projections of the Snow Empress, the Ice Empress, and the Skydream Iceworm. Of course, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass wasn’t excluded either. It was just that it grew directly from Huo Yuhao’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned when they saw the four projections that surged from Huo Yuhao’s body. Even those of Shrek’s Seven Monsters didn’t know that he had so many Spirits in his body! They were only familiar with the Snow Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gentle, jade-green halos appeared on the bodies of all four Spirits. These halos were like dim flames that surrounded their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Empress, Ice Empress, and Skydream Iceworm were all excited. Such strong life energy was great for them. Although they were Spirits, they still craved life energy. As Spirits, they could only become more corporeal if they had sufficient energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, Spirits couldn’t leave their soul masters. However, they could travel further away from their soul masters if they were strong enough. They could also get closer to becoming as corporeal as they were when they were still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Life force, especially pure life force, nourished their bodies much more than soul power. How could these four Spirits be unwilling?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi’s fusion also seemed to be going smoothly. His Xuanwu Shield already shone with a layer of bright gold, and the tortoise-snake on it seemed to come alive as it squirmed slightly. But the Golden Tortoise kept on expanding in size. Right now, it was already five meters in diameter. As it lay where it was, golden light shone brightly from its body, making it look extremely magical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It definitely wasn’t a twenty-thousand or thirty-thousand year soul beast. Huo Yuhao could tell that by now. The size that this Golden Tortoise had expanded to was the actual size of its body. Even for tortoises, a species that enjoyed great longevity, it was impossible for a twenty-thousand or thirty-thousand year tortoise to grow to such a size! This meant that this Golden Tortoise indeed suffered from a problem. Its problem was very obvious, and it was even taboo for the kings of soul beasts in the Great Star Dou Forest. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have to restrain its own size. Only one thing about it was real.. its weakness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Huo Yuhao was certain that the Golden Tortoise’s life energy didn’t belong to it, even though it was immense. It wasn’t able to control such great life energy. The force that was restraining all the life energy disappeared after the Golden Tortoise fused with Xu Sanshi, releasing it all in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only beneficiary. To different extents, everyone around him felt comfortable as they were immersed in this immense life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a soul master reached an advanced tier, his physical strength was an important barrier that limited the increase of his cultivation. The immense life energy that they basked in was enough to provide them with sufficient energy to fight for years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from Huo Yuhao, Xu Sanshi benefited the most. During his fusion with the Golden Tortoise, the amount of life energy he absorbed was only less than what Huo Yuhao’s Life Guardian Blade absorbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, there was an additional dim golden glow on his skin, which seeped into his body and even made his blood vessels visible. They were stained gold, and even his blood turned gold. This gold that covered and penetrated his entire body was filled with life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the origin strength of the Golden Tortoise. Although it couldn’t absorb all that life energy, it seemed to have fused with a lot of it. Right now, all of that was pouring into Xu Sanshi’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tortoise suddenly lifted its head and said to Xu Sanshi, “If you go against this contract in the future and don’t find me a pretty tortoise, I’ll fight it out with you. You’ve gained greatly this time!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi chuckled and replied, “Don’t worry. I’m a man of my word. However, what’s going on here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The contract was about to be completed, but the Golden Tortoise’s body was still very corporeal. There wasn’t any sign that its body was about to gradually disappear as it neared the end of this Spirit Fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tortoise laughed bitterly. “Greedy! Greedy! Otherwise, why would I bother fusing with a human? It’s all my fault. I was too greedy then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I seem to be familiar with your aura.” Beside Huo Yuhao, the Skydream Iceworm, who presented himself as a handsome man, suddenly opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Tortoise glanced at him and said, “Familiar? Who are you? Why do I sense something from your aura, too?”</span></p>
