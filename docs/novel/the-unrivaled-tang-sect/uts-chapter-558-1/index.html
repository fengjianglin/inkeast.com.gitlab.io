 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only three places where humans could create their soul cores. They were the forehead area between the eyebrows, the chest, and the dantian. If he were to set up his second soul core in his dantian, he could forget about creating a third soul core in his chest. In order to do that, he would have to first cut off the connection between his two soul cores. And that would be tantamount to suicide!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This also meant that if Huo Yuhao decided to create his second soul core in his dantian, he would have no chance of creating a third soul core. No matter how strong he eventually became, he would never be considered a true Ultimate Douluo. In other words, he would not be able to inherit the God of Emotions’ Godly Seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Huo Yuhao had long decided to not only create his soul core with the Yin Yang Complement method, but also create it at his chest area. This allowed him to create his third soul core in his dantian in the future. When the time arrived, his third soul core would only face interference from the soul core in his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ice Empress, are you there?” Huo Yuhao was trying to communicate with the Ice Empress inside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes? Is there a problem?” The Ice Empress’ voice rang inside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “ I’m going to start on my second soul core and push for Titled Douluo. I was thinking of using the Yin Yang Complement method to achieve that. I might need to trouble you to help me with that. This is because my body contains your Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s torso bone, and your power is strongest in my chest area—the area where I plan to create my second soul core. For my second soul core, I plan to use our Ultimate Ice soul power as the main force to create it. If my plan succeeds, my first soul core would control my spiritual power, while my second soul core would control my soul power. Both my soul cores would complement one another, and allow both soul power and spiritual power to communicate with one another, forming a perfect fusion between these powers. This would allow my soul skills and abilities to possess both powers simultaneously.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what Huo Yuhao said, the Ice Empress went silent before sighing. “Do you know how hard this is going to be?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “I don’t know how hard it will be. But regardless of its difficulty, I plan to give it a try. Do you think you can help me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress said, “Of course I am going to help you. I must say you are truly extremely gifted and very intelligent. The path you are choosing to tread is probably the most extreme of methods among those who possess Ultimate Ice, or even among all cultivators in the world. Such extreme cultivation methods will often give you endless potential.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” Huo Yuhao did not expect the Ice Empress to shower him with praise after expressing her doubts at his chances of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress said, “In the world of soul beasts, all those who possess true wisdom and powerful abilities chose the path you plan to take. However, only one—Di Tian—has succeeded. That is why he is the strongest soul beast in the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was startled by her words. “Does that mean you have actually tried this approach?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress said, “No. I don’t have the right conditions to attempt this. This was because I had not attained what was equivalent to the humans’ Ultimate Douluo rank, and was not able to construct my second soul ring. However, the Snow Empress actually tried it before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Snow Empress!” Huo Yuhao exclaimed in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, the Snow Empress’ voice could be heard. “Yes! I have tried it before. If I had actually succeeded, I would not have feared Di Tian at all. My abilities would be at least on par with his. However, I failed. My origin was heavily damaged, and I lost the ability to push for higher powers. Hence, I could only choose to transform into an embryo—something which you have fortuitously benefited from.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao did not know that the Snow Empress had such an eventful life before meeting him. After hearing her story, he was exhilarated. If the Snow Empress had tried it before, she must possess some valuable experience. Right now, nothing was more important and valuable than experience!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “I have tried it before, so I know better than others how difficult this path is going to be. Di Tian did not succeed because his determination and resilience were stronger than mine, but because his Golden Eyes Black Dragon King’s body was sufficiently tough. In order to complete the Yin Yang Complement cultivation method, one has to split one’s spiritual power and soul power completely before fusing them together again. This will take an enormous toll on one’s body, and requires an incredible degree of control.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your current spiritual power should be sufficient for you to meet the second condition. However, because you are but human, the strength of your body would never be able to compare to us soul beasts. We—as soul beasts—choose not to use the Resonance cultivation method because the structure of our bodies does not allow us to do that. Our circulation passageways are built very differently from yours, and we do not possess such good acupoints. Hence, we only have two places to create our soul cores. This limitation is why we will never be able to become a God. And these two positions will not allow any resonance to occur. This forces us to choose the Yin Yang Complement method. Yuhao, are you sure you really want to do this? If you fail, you will have to suffer very serious consequences.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered without any hesitation. “No matter what, I am going to give it a try. If I succeed, we will have set up a good foundation for my eventual development into a God. If I fail…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suddenly paused for a short while before continuing with an even more determined tone. “I will not fail unless I die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without the courage and determination to go all-out, how could a human stand any chance of breaking the barrier of mortality?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A heavy silence fell upon the room as both the Snow Empress and the Ice Empress went quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a short while, the Snow Empress replied solemnly, “In that case, we will bet our lives on you. All six of us will help you. I don’t believe that you can still fail with all of our help. Yuhao, just focus on your own cultivation later. Don’t care about us and what we will do later. We will put in our best, and leave no what-ifs behind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Huo Yuhao nodded and closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead of starting immediately, Huo Yuhao began to adjust his psychological state. Success was only possible if he was in the best state of mind. When it came to such crucial moments, it was always good to be patient, and to make sure all preparations were done properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Streaks of light started to leave his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first ones to emerge from his body were the Snow Empress and the Ice Empress. They were the two strongest Spirits among the six of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following which, the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass, Little Bai, the Skydream Iceworm, and Li Ya appeared one by one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The six Spirits gathered around Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress looked at the other five Spirits before saying, “I believe you have all heard what Yuhao has said. While this closed-door cultivation is extremely important for him, it is equally important for all of us. We have been using his body as a foundation to continue living. If anything were to happen to him, all of us would be in trouble too. If he succeeds, we will have succeeded as well. Hence, I need everyone to help him overcome this challenge at all costs together. Don’t worry about expending our energy, because once he succeeds, he will be able to use the new soul core formed from this Yin Yang Complement method for our benefit. In addition, just as he has already mentioned, his success would be a huge step forward in our journey to become Gods with him. This is a common goal which we all share after becoming his Spirits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five other Spirits nodded in unison. The Skydream Iceworm was visibly excited as he said, “That’s great! I’ve been waiting for this day for so long. Now that Yuhao is finally going to make a huge step in that direction, I will definitely support him with my life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress glanced at him and said, “Skydream, I need to warn you to not use all of your power to help him. You already fused your origin with him lest time. I need you to tone it down a little bit this time around. Trust us. We can do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm was startled to hear the Ice Empress’ words. He looked over to the Ice Empress, only to see her turn away immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress was frustrated by his actions as she said, “What are you looking at? She is worried about you. Isn’t that enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm’s body started to tremble, but he did not tease anyone with his words. He simply nodded to acknowledge the Snow Empress’ words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass shook its leaves gently to express its support. Among the six different Spirits, it was probably the weakest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress continued, “The new soul core that Yuhao plans to create with the Yin Yang Complement is going to be of the Ultimate Ice type. Under such circumstances, we will require an enormous amount of Ultimate Ice energy. Li Ya, I need you to assist Yuhao to stabilize the spiritual soul core in his Spiritual Sea. If need be, delay its interference on the work on our side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Ya nodded. Even though she had only joined not too long ago, as a mermaid princess, she possessed wisdom which exceeded that of an average human. She naturally understood the gravity of the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress continued to delegate work as she announced, “Skydream, you will assist Li Ya, as your origin is infused with his. It will be easier for you to help coordinate things there. At the same time, I need you to keep watch on his body’s situation. We must not allow his body to fail. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress raised the Ice Empress’ hand and said, “The Ice Empress will be anchoring our efforts today. This is because Huo Yuhao plans to create his soul core at his chest area—the area where the Ice Empress’ Ice Jade Empress Scorpion’s torso bone is. While I will assist the Ice Empress, I need Little Bai and Star Anise to join us, because all four of us possess Ultimate Ice soul power. We will work together to help Yuhao form his soul core. Star Anise, you will be in charge of stabilizing the process. Little Bai, you will protect Yuhao’s body while we form the soul core. The Ice Empress and I will be moving his soul power towards his chest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roger!” The three Ultimate Ice Spirits replied in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a few lines, the Snow Empress was able to arrange everything properly.</span></p>
