 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t ask any further. He put himself in their shoes. If he was any of them, he wouldn’t have been able to accept fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The malt wine arrived again. Long Xiaoyao gulped down more and more wine. An unhealthy flush surfaced on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The waiter hurriedly said, “Elder Long, drink slower. It’s not good for your body if you drink too quickly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook his head softly. “Take the cup. I’m not drinking anymore. I’ll just sit for a while longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, no problem. You and your friends can sit as long as you want.” The waiter took the cup away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao opened his eyes once again. He looked at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong bitterly. It seemed like his story had ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I owe Xishui. This debt cannot be repaid. That was her first time. I owe Mu En too. I can’t repay my debt to him either. Now, you should know why I’m committing all this evil. I knew that Xishui was killing with her Holy Ghost Church, but I still chose to protect her. I thought that I could forget, but I can’t. Even after seeing her for many decades, I can still remember everything clearly. That’s why I can’t stop her no matter what she does. I don’t have that right. When I committed that grave error, my life didn’t belong to me anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Compared to Mu En, Xishui was more hurt. I was the one who ruined her life. I love her, and I’m willing to sacrifice everything for her. My life belongs to her too. I can only die before her. If she dies before me, I’ll follow her. That’s why no one can persuade me to leave her. My life has long been tied to hers.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s breathing became a little heavy. However, there was a relieved look on his face. It was his first time telling his story after so many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he didn’t finish his story, anyone could guess that what followed was a tragedy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was also having mixed feelings. He didn’t know if he should pity the Darkness Holy Dragon or feel sad for his teacher. Perhaps, this tragedy was an arrangement of fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao stood up and said, “I should leave. Treasure the person in front of you, young man. Remember, find me when your cultivation reaches Rank 98. I’ll go and fetch Xishui now.” After he finished speaking, he took big steps out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong remained where they were without moving. The situation seemed to have become more complex. After listening to Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui’s story, they still couldn’t change their stance, even though they pitied her for what had happened. After all, Ye Xishui was the true mastermind of the Holy Ghost Church. Under her leadership, the Holy Ghost Church had killed many people. Even Long Xiaoyao was suspected of helping her. That was a fact that couldn’t be wiped away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They weren’t going to be less hostile, but they were more understanding. Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand and laughed bitterly, “All this while, I felt that we’ve suffered a lot. However, it’s nothing compared to what teacher, Elder Long and Ye Xishui have gone through. We’re quite lucky. At least we are together. I’m really satisfied now. I really want to leave with you and find a quiet place where we can live together. Occasionally, we can see our teammates. How great would that be?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stood up and walked to Huo Yuhao’s side. She sat in his lap and hugged his neck. She completely placed her face in his embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt something wet. Tang Wutong’s body was shaking slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been suppressing her emotions when Long Xiaoyao was telling his story earlier, but right now, she completely let them go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher is really too pitiful. I can imagine why he fought so hard against the Body Sect. Given his abilities, he wouldn’t be hurt so easily. If not to protect Shrek, he might have chosen to free himself already. The pain he’s been through must be even deeper than what Elder Long has been through.” Tang Wutong said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao silently nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mu En had never told them about what happened between him, Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao before. He had kept this secret to himself until the day he died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Huo Yuhao’s mind, Elder Mu’s figure resurfaced. He recalled his elderly face, and Huo Yuhao’s eyes started to turn red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Moon Empire, Imperial Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was seated, and held a cup of tea in her hand. She was silently tasting the tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s Imperial Palace was very particular when it came to serving tea. Only the best tea leaves that were half-fermented were chosen. They were specially prepared. Every year, there was very little production of such tea leaves. Only members of the imperial family were given the privilege to enjoy such tea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was very calm right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was sitting in the main seat. Beside him was Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Elder Ye, this matter might really be a misunderstanding. I still hope that you can be magnanimous. I’m willing to make amends to the church. If there’s anything you need, please tell me.” Xu Tianran appeared very courteous, and spoke with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was also decked in bright yellow beside him. She didn’t say a word. She didn’t even react at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui put the cup of tea down. She turned to Ju Zi and said, “Your Majesty, what if I want someone? What if I only want one person?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s expression stiffened. Even though he knew who Ye Xishui wanted, he still asked, “Who do you want?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui laughed coldly, “I want Her Majesty to follow me to the Holy Ghost Church. Is that possible?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi sat there calmly and seemed to be completely ready to comply with any instructions Xu Tianran had for her. There was no expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s expression changed slightly, and he replied, “Elder Ye, I’m afraid that cannot happen. My inner palace is too empty. I only have the Empress. We are very close to each other. This incident is a little weird. Why don't we talk after investigating carefully?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui waved him off and said, “There’s no need to. If you want to condemn someone, you can always find an excuse. I don’t expect you to investigate anything. Furthermore, from your actions, I know what your choice is. There is nothing else to say. I can understand what Your Majesty is thinking. I was only joking earlier. Since you’ve decided to give us up, I only have one wish, which is for you to let the Holy Ghost Church off. I’m willing to leave the empire with the church. We just want peace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran was stunned as he looked at Ye Xishui. Was she still the Death God Douluo he knew? This wasn’t something he knew she was capable of saying.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s going on? Why is she acting like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui lifted her teacup and took a sip once again. She sighed, “I’m tired. I have no other wish in my life anymore. I just hope to live out the rest of my life in peace. Your Majesty, you have to admit that the church has contributed to the empire, even though we’ve brought you a lot of trouble. I hope this will make you show some mercy on us. I’ll be satisfied then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran laughed and asked, “Elder Ye, what are you talking about? Whether your church wants to stay or leave is up to you. No matter what, the church will always be a partner to the empire. It’s just that… about your church being a national church…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui laughed slightly. “It’s just a title. We don’t need it. You can take it back. I came here today just to tell you that we won’t seek any vengeance. We just hope to obtain peace. That’s all I wanted to say. Your Majesty, please take care. I’m going to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui stood up and slowly walked out. She seemed to be a little slow, and she also appeared very old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran stood up and gestured. However, he didn’t move a single inch. He only watched as the Death God Douluo slowly walked out of the palace hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was doubtful as she looked at Xu Tianran. She softly asked, “Your Majesty, do you think she’s for real?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran shrugged her off and revealed a cold smile on his face, “Will she be so tame? The more she tries to look weak, the bigger the problem is. She’s just trying to numb us. Not only do we have to carry on with our plan, but we need to be quicker with it too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A light flashed in Ju Zi’s eyes. “So now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran nodded, and swiped his right hand down with force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi suddenly stood up and turned around before walking away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui revealed a relieved look on her face as she walked out of the palace hall. She had finally said what she had to say. It was really time for her to leave. No matter whether Xu Tianran believed her, what she had said was the truth. It was from the bottom of her heart.</span></p>
