Suddenly, he quickly pulled his right leg up and kicked Dai Luoli’s chest. He was so quick that he even seemed to form shadows along the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli’s tiger claws were about to grab Huo Yuhao’s shoulders when he was kicked seven to eight meters away, and collapsed to the ground before he could touch Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao frowned and said, “Are you trying to defeat me with the kind of skills you are showing? Soul masters aren’t everything. It still depends on the person. I’m now your opponent, and I think you are being too soft. Are you a girl?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You!” Dai Luoli crawled up from the ground and glared furiously, “How dare you say I’m a girl?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He charged forward once again, and his first soul ring shone. He used his White Tiger’s Shield, which was the most common first soul skill of a White Tiger. A layer of white light shone from his body and protected him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Huo Yuhao discovered the difference between Dai Luoli’s White Tiger and a conventional White Tiger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A conventional White Tiger was filled with might and dominance after unleashing its soul skill. However, Dai Luoli’s White Tiger was filled with spirituality after he unleashed his White Tiger’s Shield. His spiritual aura suddenly became very strong and blended with his soul power. It actually felt as if his spiritual and soul power had fused together. This was only a situation that occurred when one used an advanced self-created fighting skill!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli burst towards Huo Yuhao again. Either he was stubborn or confident; he did the same thing he had before, reaching out towards Huo Yuhao’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stomped on the ground with his right foot. A low-pitched muffled sound echoed out, and Dai Luoli felt a tremor coming from underneath his feet. He was thrown a few meters into the air. As he rose into the air, his claws naturally didn’t reach their target.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a step forward and pressed his right hand against Dai Luoli’s chest. Dai Luoli’s White Tiger Shield started to shine with white light in a bid to push Huo Yuhao away. However, it was a pity that he couldn’t do so in the face of absolute strength, not to mention that his soul power was nowhere near great enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next instant, Dai Luoli flew back again. He didn’t collapse on the ground this time, with his White Tiger’s Shield protecting him. Instead, he staggered more than ten steps backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Dai Luoli’s expression finally turned serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Huo Yuhao’s fighting abilities were merely outstanding and he had underestimated his opponent earlier, then it wasn’t just a coincidence this time. His opponent wasn’t a soul master but had managed to force him back twice in a row. Huo Yuhao’s terrifying strength couldn’t be underestimated anymore!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch out! I’m going to get serious now!” Dai Luoli shouted. His aura suddenly changed, and his white hair started to look shinier. The spiritual undulations that Huo Yuhao had sensed earlier also became much stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli leapt forward again as his figure flashed. However, he suddenly changed directions in the air this time and landed in a spot diagonally three meters to Huo Yuhao’s left. He instantly sprang forward again, and his speed soared. He turned into a projection and immediately reached behind Huo Yuhao. He deftly grabbed Huo Yuhao’s shoulder with one claw while he reached for Huo Yuhao’s waist with his other claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether it was in terms of speed, strength or technique, he used them very well this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least this guy has some skill...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t turn around. He waved his hands back at the same time to block Dai Luoli’s claws and grabbed them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was stunned, and thought to himself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Are you really an ordinary person without a martial soul who can fight me in terms of strength even after I’ve unleashed my martial soul?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t pull his claws away. Instead, he exerted his strength and attempted to drag Huo Yuhao down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t move a single inch. Dai Luoli saw Huo Yuhao’s hands turn completely white before a huge force drove into him. Suddenly, he was flung from behind Huo Yuhao, back to his front, and flew in the air for a few seconds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli didn’t fall like the last two times. As he roared out, his third soul ring shone, and his body grew larger. It was his White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His figure enlarged once again, and the uniform he was in burst open. The hair on his body was now covered with a layer of gold. He extended his claws and reached towards Huo Yuhao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hard!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the only feeling that Dai Luoli had. He had already used his White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation, but his opponent’s palms seemed to be even harder than his claws. This was beyond his comprehension.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How is this possible? Are these human hands?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Dai Luoli was trying to get over his shock, Huo Yuhao pulled his right hand back before pushing it forward hard. Dai Luoli was thrown back once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His strength is greater than my White Tiger’s Vajra Transformation. Is he still human?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Dai Luoli landed on the ground, he didn’t rush to attack Huo Yuhao. He only stared at him intently and tried to size him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao calmly said, “Now you know that a martial soul isn’t everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli snorted and said, “I haven’t given my all yet. Furthermore, only your technique is good. You can’t break through my defense.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed, “Do you really think so? Do you really think that I can’t overcome your defense? Watch carefully then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao made the first move for the first time in this fight. He charged towards Dai Luoli with long strides. He still didn’t use any soul power, but he was already pretty quick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli stared at him sternly, and the golden light from his body became stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that Huo Yuhao was about to reach him, Dai Luoli wanted to exert his strength. However, Huo Yuhao suddenly disappeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli felt a large hand strangling his neck. Before he could even struggle, a strong tingling and numbing feeling spread throughout his body. His soul power couldn’t circulate anymore, and the hair on his body quickly faded away. He returned to his original appearance within a breath. Of course, there were still some broken pieces of cloth on his body right now, which helped to cover vital parts of his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao swung his hand and threw Dai Luoli off to one side. He shook his head gently as he looked at him before he walked back towards their bunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait here for me. I’ll go get some clothes for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Luoli was stunned as he watched Huo Yuhao slowly leave. He seemed to lose focus in his eyes, and an indescribable sense of frustration caused him to turn pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s judgment was right. He was indeed the youngest son of the White Tiger Duke Dai Hao. This meant that he was Huo Yuhao’s younger half-brother. When he was young, his martial soul had mutated. Although his White Tiger was awakened, it was different from Dai Yueheng and Dai Huabin’s White Tiger. Dai Luoli’s mother was greatly suppressed in the Duke’s Mansion; even though her status was slightly higher than that of Huo Yuhao’s mother, she wasn’t in a much better condition.</span></p>

He wasn’t any less hardworking than Dai Yueheng and Dai Huabin. However, it was much more difficult to cultivate with his mutated martial soul than expected. He wasn’t able to enter Shrek Academy because he didn’t reach Rank 20 by the time he was twelve years old. He was the White Tiger Duke’s son. Given Dai Hao’s character, how would he let him get in through back channels?</span></p>

However, he was already going to turn eighteen, and yet his soul power was only at Rank 32.</span></p>

He was the White Tiger Duke’s son! His cultivation wasn’t much to be raved about. Dai Hao was also very busy with military matters and didn’t have time to guide him.</span></p>

Of course, there was an even more important reason why he was here.</span></p>

He initially thought that he should still have an edge over others in the military, even if he couldn’t compare to his brothers. Today, he managed to become a Private First Class, which gave testament to this belief of his.</span></p>

He couldn’t even defeat an ordinary person, although he used a thousand-year soul skill. What other hope did he still have? Let alone becoming a hero like his father, he wasn’t even qualified to be a small team leader!</span></p>

I’ll let you be the small team leader if you can beat me, anytime you want. If this is a huge blow for you, I only have one question to ask you… how old are you? What do men rely on in this world? Men don’t rely on cowardice, but resilience.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you can’t beat me, aren’t you going to work hard to catch up? You’ll only be regarded as a piece of trash if you simply give up on yourself like this; you’ll be eliminated by this world. If that’s the case, it’d be better for you to return home, buy a plot of land, and start tilling. You can still live a stable life.”</span></p>

He didn’t have any feelings towards the rage that Dai Luoli currently felt towards him.</span></p>
