 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Ju Zi was writing something, they all stood there quietly. No one uttered a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi had taken punishment as the marshal of the entire army. The Death God Douluo even arrived to attack her. These things made all her commanders very respectful of her. How could they possibly not follow such a leader? Even though she was a little young and a lady, she was still a perfect leader, considering her successful track record and responsible attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After waiting for around ten minutes, Ju Zi finally finished writing her letter. When she lifted her head again, her eyes were already red. It seemed like she was holding tears in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal, what’s going on? What has happened?” A Class 9 soul engineer asked, astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other soul engineers and commanders were also perplexed. It was also their first time seeing Ju Zi like this. They couldn’t understand what was going on. When did she become so fragile? What happened such that she was acting like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi didn’t say anything. She bit her index finger and stamped the letter with her own blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the commanders were astonished when they saw this.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blood letter? What is she doing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi slowly stood up and walked forward. Her body was shaking. Her tears were already flowing uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Commanders, Worshipped, I’ve let everyone down.” Her tears flowed. Ju Zi shut her eyes in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Class 9 soul engineer who had spoken earlier anxiously asked, “Marshal, what’s going on? No matter what, we’ll stand on your side. Quick, tell us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi took in a deep breath and torturously answered, “I’ve received news that the soul engineer legion that the empire sent to reinforce us has been wiped out. They were killed not far from the mountain valley, along the path they had to take to reach us from the empire. A thousand soul engineers were killed, their souls were taken away, and our resources have been looted.” She added the line ‘their souls were taken away’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Exclamations echoed throughout the entire tent. Suddenly, all the soul engineers and commanders opened their eyes wide. The astonishment in their eyes was slowly turning to rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi shut her eyes in pain. “From our aerial surveillance soul tools, we discovered Bone Dragons fleeing the scene. At the same time, the aura of spectral creatures was also left behind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bone Dragon? These two words were sufficient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long ago, Zhong Liwu was riding a Bone Dragon as he fought Huo Yuhao outside Shrek City. Eventually, it had died at Huo Yuhao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bone Dragons had appeared once again. Everyone knew what it meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastards!” One legion commander roared and clenched his fists so hard that they almost broke. His soul engineer legion had lost many men, and he had been awaiting reinforcements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, he became overly agitated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi bitterly said, “I’ve already written everything regarding this incident down. I’ll immediately send it to His Majesty and implore him to take action. If this continues, our morale will certainly be affected. While our soldiers at the frontline are killing enemies for the empire, we are being stabbed in the back. How can we continue to fight and contribute to the empire if that’s the case? Everyone, I’m afraid my position as your leader is about to end. I’ve already asked His Majesty to allow me to resign. In the future, I hope all of you can continue to assist His Majesty and share his burdens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, Ju Zi lifted her hands and removed her helmet. She turned around and walked to the front of the tent before putting it down on her desk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marshal, you must not give up on us!” A vice-legion commander cried sorrowfully before he knelt down on one knee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes! Marshal, we need your leadership. Only you can lead us to rule this continent.” When the first person kneeled down, a second person started to do the same. Along with their hate for their common enemy, all the commanders kneeled down immediately. Even the Worshipped bowed down to Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing everyone like that, Ju Zi wiped away the tears in her eyes. Her expression started to turn sinister and cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I thank all of you for your support. Please rise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing that Ju Zi’s voice had returned to normal, all of them stood up once again. They focused all their attention on her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a strong killing intent coming from Ju Zi’s eyes. “How dare the Holy Ghost Church kill my soldiers? We cannot exist in the same world as them. Commanders, if we want to contribute to the empire, we need to rid ourselves of any dissidents, and kill these despicable and vicious Holy Ghost Church members. It’s only through this that we can save our empire. Who is willing to write a blood letter to His Majesty along with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m willing…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commanders were all united. After they were subjected to Ye Xishui’s attack, their rage and displeasure at the Holy Ghost Church were replaced by fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when they heard that a thousand soul engineers had been killed by the Holy Ghost Church, their suppressed rage immediately erupted once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many of them left their blood on their letters. At the same time, they also left their own signatures. This completed a blood letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi said, “Pass my order – the army will proceed in the direction of the empire. We’ll coordinate with His Majesty to get rid of the Holy Ghost Church. It’s only by destroying the Holy Ghost Church that we can continue to expand the empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes! We’ll listen to your orders.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When these commanders left their blood on their letters, their fates were tied to the War God Empress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s army started to disassemble their soul formations, while the beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions took turns to watch out for any dangers. The entire army then proceeded in the direction of the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi’s letter was immediately sent out. At the same time, the news was passed on. However, it wasn’t to Xu Tianran. It was to the Worship Hall in Radiant City. The Worship Hall was the true backer of the army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he watched the army proceeding in the direction of the Sun Moon Empire, Huo Yuhao immediately realized that Ju Zi was exploiting this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was almost time for him to find her. A grin appeared on his face. This was an opportunity he could not forgo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao concealed himself in the void along with Tang Wutong. He immediately unleashed his Spiritual Detection to check the path in front of them, as they rapidly got closer and closer to the Sun Moon Empire’s army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the sky, all types of aerial surveillance soul tools were moving along with the army. At least two soul engineer legions were flying in the air. These two soul engineer legions were responsible for surveillance and protecting the army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the members of the beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions had the ability to fly. This was why they were naturally responsible for guarding and patrolling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul engineers were helpless against Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. From afar, Huo Yuhao had already found Ju Zi using his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Ju Zi was out on the battlefield, she was still the Empress. This was why she took a different sedan from the other commanders. She had her own sedan. Sixteen horses were responsible for pulling it, and the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion was responsible for guarding it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao led Tang Wutong as they softly landed on her sedan. Tang Wutong let go of his hand said, “Go in. I won’t go. She might disrupt your plan if she’s hostile towards me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao chortled and said, “You are indeed an understanding lady!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was a little unimpressed by him, and replied, “If I were really understanding, I should let you marry her too, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, no. It’s difficult to handle too many beauties. You are enough for me. I’m going now.” His Imitation covered a sufficiently large region. This was why Huo Yuhao wasn’t afraid of Tang Wutong being exposed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a flip, he silently made his way into the sedan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sedan was very large. In fact, it was an extremely comfortable carriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was almost ten square meters inside. There was a desk, a chair and even a bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Ju Zi was the only one inside. She was thinking silently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gentle spiritual undulations spread, sealing the entire sedan. No sound from inside could be heard outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” After realizing that something was amiss, Ju Zi subconsciously lifted her head. She looked at the space in front of her, which was empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you here?” she asked softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did you know it was me?” Huo Yuhao asked, a little stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t surprised that two Ultimate Douluo had found him. However, it was illogical that Ju Zi was able to discover him. With her abilities, she shouldn’t be able to discover him when he used his Imitation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi smiled and said, “Instincts. I knew you would come. That’s why I asked all my servants to leave. I was waiting for you, and you indeed came.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao silently surfaced and sat on a bench in front of Ju Zi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How are you? I’ve not seen you for some time.” Huo Yuhao asked a few meaningless questions. Although he had isolated all sound within the sedan, he shared everything that was happening with Tang Wutong. One reason was for safety. Secondly, he was afraid that Tang Wutong would be jealous. Of course, the latter reason was more important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi snorted, “How am I? How can I be well? I’m not fine at all. Should I hate you, or thank you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Of course you should thank me. Whether it’s you or Xu Tianran, both of you want to get rid of the Holy Ghost Church, am I right? It’s just that neither of you have found an excuse to. This time, I’m delivering an excuse to you. Shouldn’t you thank me?”</span></p>
