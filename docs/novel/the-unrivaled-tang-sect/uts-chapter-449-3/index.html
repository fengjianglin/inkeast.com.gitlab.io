At the same time, her timely intervention and delay gave the Skydream Iceworm enough time to alleviate the stabbing pain in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao dragged Tang Wutong and swiftly pulled her towards the mountain’s peak.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seems impossible to chase her away at this point. I can only continue on to complete the task, and try my best to survive amongst all the dangers.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your guts are too big.” Huo Yuhao growled angrily as he accelerated towards the mountain’s peak at his fastest possible speed.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder she was keeping quiet the entire time, and didn’t make a sound when everyone else was requesting to participate in this expedition – she had already made her plans.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very calm before, but now he was starting to feel a little frantic.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their enemies didn’t care what state of mind they were in. Soul rays crisscrossed like a web of a death as they continued sweeping toward the two of them. These were all soul rays that were Class 7 or above, and they were likely to be locked on if they were struck even once.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao unleashed his Spiritual Interference Domain and Spiritual Detection to their highest possible levels. He dragged Tang Wutong as they dodged and waltzed through the air, and they continued flying closer to the mountain peak. They had to get onto the mountain.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a thousand meters away when he began his charge, and now only five hundred meters remained. His plan would have a chance of success as long as he charged through the last five hundred meters.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four hundred meters!</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao was relying on his tremendous speed and judgement ability to continue pushing forward, a spherical soul tool on the mountaintop suddenly released a layer of orange-red light.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This layer of light expanded outward, and quickly became a film of light.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could evade soul rays and cannon shells, but such area attacks that locked down every angle were futile as well. Chilly lights flickered in his eyes as he swung his right hand – Unparalleled Chill, Empress’ Sword!</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dark blue sword light burst into the world as it slashed ferociously onto the film, and what exceeded everyone’s expectations was the fact that it was actually slashed open, however, it still collided with Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s bodies, but it didn’t explode.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is…</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s eyes closed into slits.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This is evidently a light of resistance! Yes, it’s a light of resistance. This thing doesn’t have any offensive power in itself, but it’s very tenacious, and uses propulsion to push its enemies further away.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a soul tool that soul engineers typically used in battles against soul masters.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Except this was the first time that he had seen a light of resistance with such a large area of effect.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who’s this maniac who made a light of resistance into a Class 7 soul tool?</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His frustrations couldn’t solve his problems. The two of them were directly pushed from four hundred meters back to six hundred meters after they were struck by the light of resistance. Huo Yuhao would have been pushed even further if he hadn’t used his full strength to stabilize himself.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong wasn’t idle as she flapped her wings continuously while she pushed out beam after beam of dragon-shaped air flows and dispelled every attack that was most likely to threaten them.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the Sun Moon Empire seemed to have readjusted themselves. Shadow after shadow emerged from the mountaintop not far away, and they were all flying towards the two of them. The surveillance soul tools that were originally behind them turned around and began to unleash wave after wave in their direction.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Domain was about to be affected by those oscillation detectors. Even though his powerful spiritual power could also in turn affect those oscillation detectors, Huo Yuhao’s reach and range was much smaller.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao regained his calm as he was faced with such a situation. He turned towards Tang Wutong and growled, “I’m going to send you onto the mountain. Afterwards, you will unleash destruction up there as much as you can – don’t care about me. Do you understand?”</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes,” Tang Wutong didn’t waste any words as she immediately agreed.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong to him and wrapped his hands around her. Tang Wutong’s slender waist was very bouncy, but it was a pity that Huo Yuhao couldn’t feel anything because he was clad in his Solo Battle Armor.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong blushed. She didn’t know what Huo Yuhao was trying to do right now, but this was the second time that she had found herself in his arms. She wasn’t angry like she was the last time, and realized to her surprise that she wasn’t even too embarrassed.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take care of yourself, and find one person for me!” Huo Yuhao hollered as blue light erupted from his Solo Battle Armor in the next moment. The blue lights flashed as they enveloped Tang Wutong, and her elegant frame was propelled from his body like a cannon shell in the next moment.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ability that came with the Solo Battle Armor –&nbsp;Transport!</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ability allowed Huo Yuhao to transform his soul power to envelope any physical body before propelling it out. The force of this propulsion was extremely large, but it wouldn’t harm the transported body at all.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why this soul skill was installed on his Solo Battle Armor was so that he could help his teammates reach their designated positions during group battles. This ability was unique to Xuan Ziwen, and the Sun Moon Empire didn’t have any soul engineers who could craft&nbsp;soul transporters.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Tang Wutong’s body was propelled toward the mountain, the soul power that was pushing her forward naturally transformed into a protective layer. She was moving almost as fast as a cannon shell.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Empire evidently didn’t expect Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong to have such a burst of speed after being pushed back by their light of resistance. This explosion of speed was comparable to that of a Titled Douluo.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao became target practice after Tang Wutong was gone. Tremendous masses of cannon shells and soul rays swept in his direction.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The oscillation detectors behind Huo Yuhao had completed their sweep on him at the same time. Even though they couldn’t lock onto him precisely, they could reduce the size of his rough location to ten percent of the area they were targeting before. Therefore, Huo Yuhao was entirely trapped in a barrage of attacks!</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao vanished into thin air with a flash of light, and reappeared fifty meters away. Instant Teleportation!</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This soul skill couldn’t be used repeatedly, but Huo Yuhao finally used it at that crucial moment.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong had already closed in on the main peak. The attacking soul tools were targeted at Huo Yuhao before this, and thus there actually weren’t any attacks that locked on to her position at this moment. Most of the defensive soul tools on the main peak would lose their effectiveness once she arrived on the main peak.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could feel that some soul tools that were Class 8 or above were done charging, and he would have to face a truly unstoppable fusillade in the next moment!</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quick, Wutong!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He needed Tang Wutong to find an enemy for him, with which he would use the Xuanwu Displacement that he had duplicated from Xu Sanshi to switch himself over.</span></span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Death God is attacking Wutong!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao could feel goosebumps break out over his body. Even though he knew Tang Wutong wasn’t Wang Dong’er, they looked identical after all – furthermore, he was still holding on to a thread of hope in his heart that they were one and the same.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had seen how powerful the Death God was when it unleashed its power. Back then, a blinding patch of white had appeared, but the light beam was red this time, and it didn’t seem like it could cover as large an area as the white light from before could reach. However, how could he let Tang Wutong be struck by an attack such as this?</span></span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong also realized what was happening when the dark red beam blasted out. A stifling sensation coursed throughout her body, and she lowered her head subconsciously to look – but the red beam was already in front of her.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong felt as if all the blood in her body was frozen in that moment, and agonizing howls rang out in her ears, as if she had descended into purgatory.</span></span></p>

Therefore, the first thing Tang Wutong saw after he used Xuanwu Displacement was a red beam swallowing his entire body.</span></span></p>

Tang Wutong felt as if that dark red beam didn’t fall onto Huo Yuhao – instead, she felt as if it had pierced her heart. Her heart ached so much that she couldn’t breathe at that moment, and she flapped her wings hysterically as he raced toward Huo Yuhao.</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the cannon fire that was concentrated on Huo Yuhao before this closed in on her. She didn’t have Spiritual Interference Domain, so she was directly locked onto.</span></span></p>

A golden trident shone brilliantly on her forehead, and golden light flashed once before she forcefully broke out from all the cannon fire as she bolted directly toward the mountaintop.</span></span></p>

There were thirteen soul masters of varying ages with them, but every single one of them were powerful Titled Douluo – there were even two Transcendent Douluo amongst them.</span></span></p>

The attacking plan that he and the White Tiger Duke had devised was simple – he would bring every single one of them onto the main peak.</span></span></p>

However, this plan had a prerequisite, and that was that Huo Yuhao had to be able to rush onto the main peak and buy enough time to release the others.</span></span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Nobody could feel any undead inside the spectral demiplane, as Huo Yuhao had scattered the undead creatures far away beforehand. Huo Yuhao had used his spectral demiplane before when he was rescuing the White Tiger Duke, and this time, even though the White Tiger Duke would suspect him, Huo Yuhao couldn’t be bothered with that, as they needed to break through the Ming Dou Mountain Range’s defenses. </span></p>
