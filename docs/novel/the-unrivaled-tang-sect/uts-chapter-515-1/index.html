<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Huo Yuhao was trying to figure out the technique, what left the deepest impression in his mind were some words from a familiar voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique is the most difficult carving technique from my world. After becoming a God, I invested my leisure time into its continual improvement and development. As they say, one’s deep mastery of a single skill will open doors to many other skills. You can think of this as a gift from me. I hope you can put in the effort to understand the beauty and intricacies behind this skill. Using the Ghostcarving Godly Blade to perform the Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique would grant you abilities beyond your imagination.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he opened his eyes and saw the pulsating Mayan blue flame before him, Huo Yuhao became unbelievably excited. Now, he was certain that everything he had experienced in the God Realm was real.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, everything was real!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both the Ghostcarving Godly Blade and the Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique were gifts from the God of Emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was engulfed by passion and excitement. Even though the Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique was mainly used for carving, Huo Yuhao knew it contained insights on the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth. He was surprised by how much he had already learned in this short period of reminiscence, and knew how studying the technique more would help to shed light on the mysteries of the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he took another look at the block of scarlet devil essence, Huo Yuhao no longer showed the same unwillingness to work with it. All that was left was excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Let’s see what the Rain Dragon’s Dance can do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was an incredibly fast learner—this could be seen from his multiple successes with deep meditation. The Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique was already imprinted in the depths of his soul. This was planned by the God of Emotions—Rong Nianbing—so that he could pick up the technique quickly. Thus, any preliminary understand or even mastery would not be too challenging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao waved his right hand as he watched the blue flame—the blade—twitch in his hand. Following which, the blade slashed forward at an unbelievable speed, leaving a mysterious yet alluring flash in its wake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that very instant, a chip fell off the corner of the block of scarlet devil essence silently. It was only when it landed on the bench that the burning fire poison was released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So fast! It feels so good!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao felt as though the blade had become an extension of his body. This sensation was simply incredible, and nearly addictive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao waved his right hand again, and once more, the Mayan blue flame appeared to merely jolt. As expected, the tough scarlet devil essence was sliced like a carrot by the Ghostcarving Godly Blade, which was sharp beyond belief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slowly, Huo Yuhao started to pick up speed. Because he already possessed an important foundational ability when it came to carving, it was not too challenging for him to pick up the Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghostcarving Godly Blade did not seem to possess any additional ability beyond its incredible sharpness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was definitely the sharpest weapon Huo Yuhao had seen in his life. Strangely, no matter how he used the blade, the blade of the Ghostcarving Godly Blade would neither come into contact with his fingers nor cut him in any way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Prior to the Ghostcarving Godly Blade, Huo Yuhao had also felt a similar affinity with other weapons. But this was the first time he actually felt a weapon connect with his soul. It was almost an extension of his consciousness and intentions. Hence, the Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique would definitely be able to exercise the full capability of the Ghostcarving Godly Blade.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After making a round of the Soul Tool Hall and instructing some of the disciples who he felt were gifted, Xuan Ziwen proceeded to where Caitou was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Huo Yuhao, Caitou was definitely the most gifted one. What made Xuan Ziwen particularly pleased about Caitou was his passion and dedication to researching soul tools. Even though Caitou did not possess the earthshattering talents that Huo Yuhao had, Caitou’s foundation was very strong, and his mind was dead set on soul tools. He had built a solid foundation as a Class 7 soul engineer, and in Xuan Ziwen’s eyes, Caitou was most definitely capable of becoming a Class 9 soul engineer. In fact, Xuan Ziwen believed that Caitou might even surpass Huo Yuhao when it came to soul tool research.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought about this, Xuan Ziwen could not help but feel frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao, why can’t you just dedicate your attention and efforts to soul tool research? You are so gifted, yet so unfocused when it comes to such things. I can’t imagine what you would be able to achieve if you were to put all your attention into the making of soul tools!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though his mind harbored such intentions, Xuan Ziwen knew well enough that it was impossible for him to convince Huo Yuhao to commit to soul tools. He knew he was not the only one who held high hopes for Huo Yuhao. There were a whole bunch of people at Shrek Academy who wished Huo Yuhao would become a star in different fields.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fact that Huo Yuhao could take time off to learn how to make soul tools was already a big win for him. No matter what, Xuan Ziwen wanted Huo Yuhao to become a Class 9 soul engineer.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he is able to build his own Class 9 soul tools, he will finally understand the absolute advantage soul tools hold over soul masters. Once it comes to that stage, I will no longer need to worry about him not putting enough effort into soul tool research. I’m sure if he puts all his effort into the making of soul tools, he has a good chance at becoming a Class 10 soul engineer! After all, he has the potential to become an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was thinking about all of these things, he arrived at Caitou’s soul tool workshop. Because Caitou was under Xuan Ziwen’s tutelage —the great soul tool researcher—he was able to make significant progress despite researching some immensely difficult Class 8 soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen purposely stayed behind at Caitou’s place a little longer to provide detailed instructions and mentoring. Even though he held great expectations for Huo Yuhao, he held Caitou in similar importance. Caitou was a pure soul engineer, and Xuan Ziwen believed that sometimes, hard work was more important than innate talent. Caitou was definitely not a disciple worth neglecting nor giving up on! Even though Fan Yu’s understanding of soul tools could not match Xuan Ziwen’s, he was still able to help Caitou build up a solid foundation for the understanding of soul tools. As long as Caitou continued to work hard and ensured his soul power’s growth was in stride with his soul tool research ability, it would not be long before he became a Class 9 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was never stingy when it came to sharing what he had learned and knew about soul tools. Because he was serious when it came to teaching, and Caitou was equally serious when it came to learning, the day passed quickly for both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s time for dinner. Come, let’s go and eat now.” Xuan Ziwen patted He Caitou’s shoulder as a rare smile formed on his face. He continued, “You’re improving really quickly recently. It seems like you must have developed a deeper understanding of soul tools?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou smiled and replied, “It’s all thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen laughed, “Oh, come on! The others might not know, but do you think I really can’t tell? You might look honest and simple, but you’re a very meticulous and hardworking person. You’re so much better than Yuhao! It would be so good if he was half as hardworking as you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he heard Xuan Ziwen mention Huo Yuhao, Caitou could not help but ask, “Teacher Xuan, why didn’t you get Yuhao to study soul tool construction now that he’s finally back?” He realized Xuan Ziwen had essentially spent his entire day at his place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen smiled slyly and replied, “Of course I won’t let him go that easily. I have given him an extremely difficult task and told him to complete it in a single day. Come and follow me. I’m going to show you how this lad is going to fail so badly. We must give him a punishment once in a while. If not, his ego would expand beyond proportions!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou smiled. “Teacher Xuan, you have wronged Yuhao. He is not someone who would let praises go to his head easily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! It is still important to wake this lad up when necessary. We need to stop him from becoming complacent. In a soul engineer’s line of work, hard work is as important as talent. It’s no use for him to only possess talent. If not for his solid foundation, I would have chased him out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his teacher’s words, He Caitou couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “Teacher Xuan, your words might sound tough, but they can’t hide your love for Huo Yuhao. I don’t think you could even bear to chase him away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen glared at him and threatened, “I see! It seems like all of you brothers plan to cover for one another, is that it? You little rascal! Do you want me to give you an impossible task tomorrow as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No! Just pretend I didn’t say anything at all.” He Caitou was scared after hearing the threat from Xuan Ziwen. He quickly added, “It’s definitely time for Yuhao to be knocked down and reminded of what is required to become a successful soul engineer. You should most definitely punish him to the best of your ability!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you still human? He’s your junior brother, and yet you’re trying to get him into trouble. How can I let someone like you inherit my skills? You’d better watch how you carry yourself, or I’ll chase you out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“......” He Caitou’s mouth twitched, but he knew there was nothing he could say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Xuan Ziwen watched his disciple who was lost for words, he let out a rare laugh. “Alright, let’s go and see how Yuhao will make a joke out of himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he brought He Caitou to his laboratory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Xuan Ziwen was not expecting to see any results from Huo Yuhao, he had still handed the task to him. He never planned for Huo Yuhao to finish it in a single day. In his mind, he knew it should take at least ten days before Huo Yuhao could complete it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Scarlet devil essence was no joke. Even if it was Xuan Ziwen—a proper Titled Douluo—who was doing it, it would take at least three days. Even so, he would be adversely affected by the fire poison from the scarlet devil essence. The only reason why he dared to let Huo Yuhao play with the scarlet devil essence was because Huo Yuhao possessed Ultimate Ice. With this ability, he shouldn’t be hurt in the process of carving the metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, both of them arrived at the doorstep of the laboratory. However, Xuan Ziwen did not walk in directly. He merely poked his head in to see what Huo Yuhao was doing. But the moment he got a good look at what was going on inside, he exploded with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You spoiled rascal!” Xuan Ziwen cursed as he stomped into his laboratory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though He Caitou did not know what was going on, he rushed into the laboratory behind Xuan Ziwen. Despite not knowing what Huo Yuhao had done, he knew from Xuan Ziwen’s look that he was probably very angry. Caitou had noticed how his stare suddenly turned steely, and decided to rush in to help de-escalate the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he stepped in through the door and saw what Huo Yuhao was doing, Caitou immediately understood why Xuan Ziwen was so angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was lying on the bench and sleeping. His breathing was unbelievably even, and his face was radiant a healthy flush. Anyone would be able to tell that he was taking a comfortable nap!</span></p>
