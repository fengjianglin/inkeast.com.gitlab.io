 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stepped out from his spectral gate with a flash, but realized to his surprise once he came out that somewhere in the distance was an ocean of fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Agonizing cries and furious roars could be heard as surging undead auras erupted both inside the sea of fire and around it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was this spectral demiplane’s owner, and he could clearly feel that his entire demiplane’s undead aura had been weakened by at least ten percent. What kind of destructive force could achieve that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao howled into the air as he tapped his foot on the ground and soared into the sky. Flourishing Ultimate Ice swiftly permeated outward as he rose into the air, and the temperature quickly plummeted as enormous snowflakes danced around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao could get a better look from a higher altitude. Everything within five kilometers of a certain point was bathed in fire. Fortunately, Huo Yuhao didn’t choose a place near the soul engineer legions’ camps when he placed Ma Xiaotao into his spectral demiplane. Otherwise, all their resources stored inside the demiplane would have been destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao was like a savage beast in human form as she charged around on the ground, and undead creatures were reduced to dust wherever she went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao’s Ultimate Fire wasn’t pure, but still possessed immense destructive power. The undead creatures were not even afraid of Holy auras, but they were very fearful of her Ultimate Fire. All kinds of undead creatures couldn’t really resist her Ultimate Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the overbearing Ma Xiaotao had infuriated several Ice Dragons inside the spectral demiplane, and those Ice Dragons had teamed up and barely stopped her hysterical massacre.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao slapped his forehead. Er Bai was clearly not around, because he hadn’t taken the jiangshi Ice Bear King back in when he fell unconscious. Otherwise, Ma Xiaotao wouldn’t be so destructive if he were around to command the other undead creatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao unleashed his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice as his long howl traveled far into the distance. He was this place’s dictator, and those undead creatures had approved of him long ago as he continued to grow stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice Dragons were the strongest undead creatures inside his spectral demiplane. Of course, that was excluding Er Bai. These Ice Dragons’ fighting strength could almost compare to that of a Titled Douluo, and three Ice Dragons teaming up could barely restrain Ma Xiaotao. They were all injured and battered, and they immediately roared deeply when they heard Huo Yuhao’s howl to ask him for assistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao seemed to sense Huo Yuhao’s aura as she turned her head towards the sky. Her dark red eyes immediately radiated intense insanity. When enemies came face-to-face, their eyes would burn with hatred!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had tossed her in before this, and she had recovered a little before she began to massacre everything around her. The Holy Ghost Church had carved murder into her bones a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao shouted angrily when she saw Huo Yuhao, and her phoenix wings flapped as she dashed toward him like a shooting star.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao paused in the air as he immediately unleashed his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice. Vigorous hurricanes of ice and snow immediately formed a giant whirlpool that swept toward Ma Xiaotao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though his mind was still a little fatigued, his Yin Yang Equilibrium soul cores’ regenerative ability had enabled him to fully recover his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could Ma Xiaotao be a match for him under such circumstances?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice locked her down completely. Ma Xiaotao was like a tiny moth struggling in a blizzard. She had already consumed much of her soul power because she had been fighting for a long time. She was now faced with Huo Yuhao, and his Ultimate Ice affected her soul power while she expended soul power continuously to the point where her soul power was finally depleted. Ma Xiaotao was so hysterical that she wanted to detonate her soul core, but Huo Yuhao dashed forward in the nick of time and used his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice to completely immobilize her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao brought Ma Xiaotao back to the ground. He stared at her frozen body and berserk expression as he heaved a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve let you down, sister. I wasn’t able to rescue you earlier, and that’s why you’ve become like this.” Huo Yuhao opened his arms as he spoke and hugged Ma Xiaotao gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had completely recovered from the injury he had sustained from the Demonic God’s Blade due to his tremendous life energy. Huo Yuhao’s soul power rippled, and his Ultimate Ice diffused into Ma Xiaotao’s body through his hug and suppressed the evil fire in her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao’s soul power was just starting to recover because of her soul core, but her soul core now slowed down as the Ultimate Ice surged forcefully into her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao helped her cross her legs to sit down before he sat opposite her, and he used Controlling Crane Capturing Dragon to draw her palms forward and place them against his as he slowly channeled his Ultimate Ice soul power, which was as pure as could be and mixed with his spiritual power, into Ma Xiaotao’s body. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s soul power entered Ma Xiaotao’s passageways, and his heart twisted into a knot. Ma Xiaotao’s situation was different from Tang Wutong. The aura of death had completely corroded Tang Wutong, while Ma Xiaotao was plagued by evil. Ma Xiaotao’s situation was comparatively better, but her passageways, skeleton, and organs had been eroded by evil qi for a long time, and that was troublesome, especially since that evil qi had vigorously invaded her spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao wasn’t like how he had been when he had first attempted to treat Ma Xiaotao. There was nothing he could do back then, and he could only rely on his Ultimate Ice to suppress that evil. Everything was different now, and his spiritual power was so much stronger than all that time ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s soul power forcefully suppressed Ma Xiaotao’s evil fire under his intricate control, and he forced out the evil qi thread by thread, like he was extracting parasites from her body. Huo Yuhao had trouble guiding the evil qi out of her body in the beginning, but he began to chant a spell, and the evil qi became a lot more malleable when the power of purification gradually coursed through Ma Xiaotao’s passageways. In other words, the evil qi was being directly purified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao used his Ultimate Ice, his formidable spiritual power, and his power of purification as he gradually rinsed and cleansed every corner of Ma Xiaotao’s body through those three channels. He dispelled every ounce of the evil qi, while he maintained her fire-type soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao’s depletion and exhaustion from before proved very beneficial. She didn’t have a vast pool of soul power, and Huo Yuhao had restricted her recovery. This enabled him to focus on her body from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took twelve hours to dispel all the evil qi from her body, and her spiritual sea was next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao could only truly awaken if the evil qi in her spiritual sea was also dispelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was undoubtedly a difficult process. It wasn’t hard to imagine how sophisticated a person’s spiritual sea could be, and furthermore, both parties were opposing each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao contemplated deeply for a few moments before he finally decided to proceed with a relatively riskier method because he couldn’t delay any further. Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea was releasing evil qi from the beginning to the end, and if he didn’t cleanse her spiritual sea completely, then everything he had just done could be wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao controlled his thoughts as he used Spiritual Dispossession against Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Spiritual Dispossession could allow anyone’s defenses against spiritual power to be instantly reduced to zero, and all defensive capabilities against spiritual power would be completely dispelled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao quickly used Spiritual Blast after he finished using Spiritual Dispossession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under his delicate control, his Spiritual Blast was only fifty percent as strong as normal. Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea trembled vigorously as his Spiritual Blast coursed through it, and Huo Yuhao took this opportunity to inject a thread of his spiritual power that had the power of purification embedded within it into Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea was entirely dark red. If Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea was a golden ocean, then her spiritual sea was molten lava.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Molten lava boiled and bubbled as the thread of purification power entered her spiritual sea. A single patch of dark red lava immediately turned golden red, but the lava immediately retaliated against Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power ferociously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s effective!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao immediately made an accurate judgment, and no longer held back as he fully unleashed his embedded purification power. Gentle white light covered a large patch of Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea and fought valiantly against all the evil qi contained within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took this opportunity to raise his right hand as he placed his finger in between Ma Xiaotao’s eyebrows, and continuously infused his power of purification into Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power was protecting her, so his power of purification couldn’t possibly hurt her brain. Furthermore, his control was very intricate and delicate, and he made his move against the core regions of Ma Xiaotao’s spiritual sea. The power of purification would spread outward from those central areas, which meant it wouldn’t touch her vital organs and parts around her spiritual sea prematurely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time continued to pass, and Ma Xiaotao’s sinister and twisted expression began to recede. Her dark and insidious face gradually regained some color and rosiness, as her evil qi was dispelled one drop after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao seemed like he was in a steamer basket as large amounts of mist and water vapor effused from his body and rose through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This represented Huo Yuhao’s formidable spiritual power that could rival that of an Ultimate Douluo.
