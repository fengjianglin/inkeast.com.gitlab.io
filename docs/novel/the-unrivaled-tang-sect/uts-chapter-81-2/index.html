 <p><strong>Book 11: The Continental Advanced Academy Soul Dueling Tournament</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 81.2: Hidden Strength...</strong></p>
 <p>“We’re still young, so the academy mainly wanted us to participate in the next tournament. Because of that, they asked us not to use all our strength under normal circumstances. But for the sake of the academy’s honor, I feel that we can no longer continue to hide. During the following two matches, it’ll be very hard for us to win if we have to face any Soul Kings.”</p>
 <p>Everyone couldn’t help but look at each other after hearing his words. Sure enough, the fact that he had been chosen by the academy meant that he wasn’t someone easily dealt with!</p>
 <p>Wang Dong looked towards Xu Sanshi, “Senior Xu, can I ask a question? During our match today, how much strength did you use?”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi thought about it for a moment. “About thirty or forty percent. In reality, Teacher Wang’s estimations were wrong. I only can release my full strength when I work together with Bei Bei. We were a couple in the first place.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so full of air when you speak,” Bei Bei said gloomily, “Who’s a couple with you? We’re partners. Explain it clearly.”</p>
 <p>“Che…” Xu Sanshi curled his lips, “Could it be that you don’t know who I like? This brother’s orientations are perfectly normal.” With that, his gaze immediately landed on Jiang Nannan’s body.</p>
 <p>However, Jiang Nannan didn’t even spare him a glance. She thoughtlessly walked over to Xiao Xiao’s side, and with a flick of the wrist, the pair of scissors that had previously appeared during the match once again appeared.</p>
 <p>Thirty to forty percent of his strength? They were all four-ringed soul masters, but just how strong was Xu Sanshi? Furthermore, there was also Bei Bei, who had similarly hidden his strength.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Huo Yuhao felt as if the preparatory team he was in wasn’t as weak as they seemed on the surface!</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao asked, “Senior Bei, does Teacher Wang know that you have been unofficially declared a member of Shrek’s Seven Monsters?”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei shook his head. “Teacher Wang doesn’t know. This is a high-level secret in the academy. Only the two Deans of the Martial Soul Department and the elders of the Sea God’s Pavilion know of it. The Sea God’s Pavilion is the highest level of command that our academy has, and it’s based on Sea God’s Island. According to the stories, the master of the Sea God’s Pavilion is the true number one expert our academy has. Only, he keeps watch from Sea God’s Island, and even we have never seen what he looks like.”</p>
 <p>“He’s even stronger than Elder Xuan?” Huo Yuhao asked astonishedly. From his recollections, Elder Xuan was already a near-omnipotent super-expert due to the terrifying speed at which he’d flown alongside them, and the catastrophic level of strength that he’d released when he’d flown into a rage.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei shrugged. “Hasn’t Elder Xuan already said it before? He’s the vice-captain of our Shrek Guardians. Since there’s a vice-captain, there’s naturally a captain. Our captain is the master of the Sea God’s Pavilion. Only, nobody has ever seen him make a move.”</p>
 <p>After listening to Bei Bei, Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao finally understood everything. Their understanding of the academy was simply too lacking. Unexpectedly, there was even a place like Sea God’s Island within the inner courtyard. Furthermore, from what Bei Bei said, this Sea God’s Island had a much greater level of influence even when compared to the Deans.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei said, “There’s no need for you guys to think too much over it. Although we’ve hidden some of our strength, we didn’t hide too much. After all, we’re still at the Soul Ancestor level of strength. You’ll see it during the tournament. Let’s just follow Teacher Wang Yan’s tactics and arrangements. However, if we get put into a 2-2-3 match, there’s a high chance that Sanshi and I will be put into a team to fight against their strongest experts. On the other hand, there may be changes in the other teams. Nannan, what would happen if you were placed with Caitou?”</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation at all, Jiang Nannan replied, “Other than a certain person, I’m fine with pairing up with anybody else.”</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi immediately interrupted her, “I know, you’re not willing to be together with a serious-looking person like Bei Bei. Bei Bei, I think it’s still better for me to work together with Nannan. You can just work with somebody else.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan flew into a rage. “Stop playing dumb. The certain person I’m talking about is you. Stay away from me, otherwise don’t blame me for being impolite to you.” As she spoke, she waved the scissors in her hand through the air.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi immediately fell silent. Clearly, he was acting as though he had fallen silent out of fear, and everybody could see that he nearly couldn’t help but fly into uproarious laughter.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei said, “Then, we’ll temporarily put you with Caitou. Yuhao, we’ll leave your partners as Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao. If we can’t deal with our enemies during the first two matches, you won’t have to try too excessively during the last match. You should do your best to hide your secrets. Preferably, it’d be better for you to lose rather than reveal some of your secrets. Understand? After all, we can still win even if we lose a single match in the round-robin tournament. Furthermore, it’s impossible for us to be put into a 2-2-3 fight every round.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Huo Yuhao replied immediately. He had nothing but utmost trust for his senior brother.</p>
 <p>A light flickered across Bei Bei’s eyes. “Fine. Everybody, go back. We don’t have to stay here anymore. Teacher Wang Yan will definitely make a few arrangements for us based on our opponent’s strengths. Everybody, go get a good rest and maintain your conditions.”</p>
 <p>After returning to their hotel room, Huo Yuhao called Wang Dong to his room to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong closed the door and said, “I didn’t think that senior brother and Xu Sanshi would’ve hidden the fact that they were unofficial members of Shrek’s Seven Devils. We should have a fighting chance now.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “It’s hard to tell. If we’re in a 1v1 elimination round or a team fight, our seniors will be able to utilise their strengths optimally. However, if we really do get into a 2-2-3 match like senior brother said, we’ll be in a bit of trouble. After all, the only strong teammates we have are the two of them.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong was somewhat unresigned. “You’re underestimating us too much. Do we not have enough strength to win a single battle? Don’t forget, we can now use our Golden Road again.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao smiled bitterly. “Out of everyone who can participate in the Continental Advanced Soul Duelling Tournament, tell me, who isn’t a real elite? Since we’ve already used the Golden Road once, our opponents will be cautious of it. Its greatest flaw is the fact that it’s an attack that only targets a single direction. As long as our opponents make a few preparations against it, our chances of succeeding will be much lower. Out of the three of us, two of us have two rings, while you have three rings. If all of our opponents are Soul Ancestors, we practically have no chance of winning.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong fell silent, as though he were pondering something.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao patted his shoulder. “Come, let’s go cultivate. Every single little bit counts. No matter what, we should do our best. We absolutely cannot let the glory of Shrek Academy and the Tang Sect be tarnished because of us.”</p>
 <p>“Right.”</p>
 <p>The matches of the round-robin tournament were held on alternate days. For example, every team in Group A would have to undergo seven matches. If a team wanted to qualify, they would have to beat five teams at the very least to stand a chance. Only by winning six matches would a team be able to guarantee themselves a spot in the next round.</p>
 <p>After two days passed, the first round of the round-robin tournament ended. When compared to the elimination round, the round-robin tournament was much more peaceful. Every single team continuously revised their battle tactics, and the strategies used in every single round of the tournament were more detailed than the last. However, it wasn’t as crazy as the elimination round.</p>
 <p>The first round of the elimination round was still affecting the round-robin tournament; the teams whose main forces had been injured were using the first round of the round-robin tournament to adjust their team’s condition. Because of that, the first round wasn’t overly exciting. It wasn’t yet time for everyone to bring out their strongest powers.</p>
 <p>However, a perspecious person could tell that the first round of the round-robin tournament was the calm before the storm. Many of the teams couldn’t afford to lose the coming matches anymore.</p>
 <p>Night.</p>
 <p>“Teacher Wang Yan, where are we going?” Bei Bei asked, puzzled.</p>
 <p>One day had passed since the first round of the tournament, and they would be starting the second round of the round-robin tournament tomorrow. However, Wang Yan was bringing the seven from the preparatory team out of the Grand Imperial Star Hotel after dinner.</p>
 <p>In the first place, this was the most bustling part of Star Luo City. The moment they stepped out the door, they were engulfed by a large and chaotic number of people.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan smiled slightly. “I’m bringing you to a place. Just follow me. Recently, we’d just finished our Guardian assignment before participating in this tournament. Your minds have been strained the whole time. It won’t be good if you’re like this the whole time. I’m bringing you to a place where you can relax. Relaxation will have some benefits for your future matches.”</p>
 <p>Relaxing?</p>
 <p>Their faces became somewhat strange. They were already aware of how strong their imminent opponents were, but Teacher Wang was actually taking them out to help them relax? Could anyone even believe him? However, Teacher Wang’s concealment skills were much better than last time, at the very least. Nobody questioned him, because everyone knew that wherever he was going to take them was definitely for the sake of obtaining better results in the tournament.</p>
 <p>Since the start of the Continental Advanced Academy Soul Duelling Tournament, the vast Star Luo City had become extremely congested. It was very hard to maintain one’s speed within the crowd, especially on the streets near Star Luo Plaza, which were permanently congested.</p>
 <p>During the past few days, Wang Yan seemed to have understood the general outlines of their surroundings. After bringing them through a crowded part of the road, they broke through the masses; there were now much fewer people around them.</p>
 <p>After passing through another few streets, they finally stopped at a pointed-looking building.</p>
 <p>This building wasn’t too conspicuous, and although it wasn’t too big compared to the other tall buildings surrounding it, it could be considered prominent. A sign with the design of a hammer was placed above its door, and the image of a golden, veined tabletop was under the hammer.</p>
 <p>Of the members of the preparatory team, only Huo Yuhao revealed a blank look at seeing this sign; the others all had a sudden flash of enlightenment.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao whispered to Wang Dong, “What is this place?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong said, “This is an auction. See the design of that sign? That elaborately carved hammer is the symbol of an auction. Only auctions and blacksmiths use a hammer as a sign, but the hammer of a blacksmith tends to be much rougher and larger. As long as it’s not too late, you should be able to hear the sounds of hammering near a blacksmith.”</p>
