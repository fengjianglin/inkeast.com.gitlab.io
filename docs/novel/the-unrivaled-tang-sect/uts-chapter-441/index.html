Even though my cultivation isn’t the best in the military, I’ll personally send you into the air in order to keep things confidential. Don’t worry. I have a Class 7 flying-type soul tool to help me. It should be fine for me to send you five thousand meters into the air. However, I’m a marshal of three armies. After I send you into the sky, I’ll need to return to lead my troops. I’ll command the soul engineer legions to attack for around an hour. You must complete your mission within this time frame. It’s still the same advice; safety first! As long as you can come back safely, you’ve done your part.”</span></p>

I still hope that you’ll come back and continue to guide me along. There have been too many things happening over these past few days. I didn’t have the time to look for you. When you return, I’ll find you, and you can continue to teach me. After that, you must also tell me why you left so suddenly that day. After you left, you don’t know how anxious I was! I still thought that the Sun Moon Empire…”</span></p>

He even turned the tables at the last minute, and preserved the glory of Shrek Academy!</span></p>

Huo Yuhao was a two-ringed soul master six years ago, while Dai Yueheng was a six-ringed Soul Emperor.</span></p>

He was jealous that they could enter Shrek Academy to learn.</span></p>

His three elder brothers were likely to be some of the most elite soul masters on the continent in the future!</span></p>

The White Tiger Duke descended from the sky. Evidently, he had just come down from the watchtower, where he had looked on as the troops were deployed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao received him, and the White Tiger Duke said, “Our men are already on the move. Yuhao, are you ready?”</span></p>

We’ll take action immediately then.” As he spoke, he retrieved a flying-type soul tool from his storage-type soul tool and put it on. As a Titled Douluo, it was still much more comfortable for him to use a flying-type soul tool, even though he was able to fly freely in the air. It was also easier for him to help Huo Yuhao into the air with the help of a soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao also started to get ready, and put on his own flying-type soul tool.</span></p>

His soul power surged, and the two of them rose into the air. They ascended in a straight line into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s gaze was fixated on a specific position on the ground. At this moment, his gaze was gentle, indistinct, and carried a sense of yearning. It felt as if he wanted to imprint everything that he was seeing into his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The look in Tang Wutong’s eyes was equally indistinct. She had never seen a man’s gaze so deep and emotional before. Within all the emotions he was experiencing, there seemed to be one of desolation...</span></p>

However, the White Tiger Duke was already high up in the air with Huo Yuhao. In such a short span of time, they managed to reach more than a thousand meters into the air as they raced skywards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eight soul engineer legions were deployed at the same time. Even though they were only there to distract their enemies, almost all of the soul masters of the Star Luo Empire had been deployed. At such a time, the mission had to be carried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fool!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong furrowed her brow. Even though she didn’t want to admit it, she was clearly aware that it was highly likely that Huo Yuhao had persisted in carrying out his surveillance of the Death God because of what had happened last night.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao also finally lifted his head. He stopped looking at Tang Wutong, who had become indistinct.</span></p>

As he sensed the low surrounding temperature, his soul power started to circulate. As the aura of Ultimate Ice filled his body, the external cold wasn’t able to affect him at all.</span></p>

Even though the operation was jointly carried out by eight soul engineer legions, there were only two thousand-plus soul masters involved. They were mainly four-ringed and five-ringed soul masters, and were widely scattered. From afar, they were subtly creeping their way towards the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a few Titled Douluo among these four-ringed and five-ringed soul masters. They were the main commanders of this operation.</span></p>

At the same time, they had to try to minimize their losses. Under such a situation, the Titled Douluo were the best candidates to ensure a smooth flow of the operation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, they weren’t attacking close to the main peak. The Death God couldn’t reach them. Of course, there were still other terrifying soul tools that the Sun Moon Empire possessed, hidden in the mountains. Without accurate intelligence, it wasn’t feasible to venture deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Empire was bullying the Star Luo Empire in terms of its lack of surveillance ability. It was difficult to tell how many soul tools they had planted in the Ming Dou Mountain Range. After all, the Star Luo Empire didn’t have any credible intelligence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At four thousand meters, the temperature had already fallen far below zero, and it was falling even further. Every few hundred meters up, the temperature dropped a further five to six degrees. After five thousand meters, the temperature was below negative a hundred degrees Celsius! Literally no biological organism would be able to survive at such a height. It was also why high-altitude aerial surveillance soul tools weren’t able to develop further.</span></p>

As Huo Yuhao was close to the White Tiger Duke’s body, he could clearly sense the explosive strength and immense soul power from him.</span></p>

He only sensed a layer of soul power that seemed to be there, and yet seemed not there in Huo Yuhao. The circulation of qi in his body was also very gentle. Under such low temperatures, Huo Yuhao was less drained than him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder he’s a top student, and someone who possesses Ultimate Ice.</span></p>

He was carrying someone, and had to keep climbing. At the same time, he had to resist the low temperature and the thinning air.</span></p>

The best Milk Bottle was only Class 7. Currently, there wasn’t a Class 8 Milk Bottle developed for a Titled Douluo to use.</span></p>

Milk Bottles were useless to them!</span></p>

A father ran around outside to support his family. Perhaps he might be less caring, but how would there be a warm family without a father supporting it?</span></p>
