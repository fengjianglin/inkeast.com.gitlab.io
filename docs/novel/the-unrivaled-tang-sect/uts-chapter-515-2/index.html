<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s hands were trembling with rage. He Caitou rushed forward and attempted to console him, “Teacher Xuan, please don’t be angry! Little junior brother must be very tired to have fallen asleep like this.” He Caitou definitely knew why Xuan Ziwen would be so angry. He hated it when his disciples did not focus on the work at hand when making soul tools. And falling asleep was definitely the biggest sin!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the person who was sleeping was Huo Yuhao, Xuan Ziwen would explode in rage. Or rather, it was precisely because the person who was sleeping was Huo Yuhao that caused Xuan Ziwen to fly into a rage.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">My poor little junior brother, why did you fall asleep? Even if you wanted to steal a nap, you should at least have been more careful, and not gotten caught!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If looks could kill, Huo Yuhao would probably have withered there and then. After glaring at Huo Yuhao, Xuan Ziwen started to look around as though he was looking for fighters who could help him beat Huo Yuhao up. Recognizing Xuan Ziwen’s actions, He Caitou stepped forward and hugged Xuan Ziwen before pleading, “Teacher Xuan, please don’t be rash! Please don’t be rash!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even at this stage, He Caitou was still controlling his voice out of fear of waking Huo Yuhao up. One could see how much brotherly love they had for one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But very soon, he realized that Xuan Ziwen’s body had stiffened. Caitou thought that the anger might have harmed his teacher’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let go of me!” Xuan Ziwen started to speak in a very strange tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, please don’t be rash! I know Yuhao failed you. Why don’t I wake him up for you to scold him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let go of me first.” Xuan Ziwen growled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No! I won’t! You’re a Titled Douluo. What if you kill Huo Yuhao?” He Caitou might be pleading, but his voice echoed the determination in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t hit him.” Xuan Ziwen replied coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really?” He Caitou was a little doubtful of what he had just heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you still insist on not letting me go, the first thing I do once I break free will be to chase you out!” Xuan Ziwen growled again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright…” He Caitou knew he could not go against his own teacher, and relented. After loosening his grip, he jumped before Xuan Ziwen and in front of Huo Yuhao. If he wanted to do anything to Huo Yuhao, he would have to go through him first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But to Caitou’s surprise, Xuan Ziwen did not go straight for Huo Yuhao, nor did he attempt to lay his hands on him. Instead, he made his way to the other end of the bench in the laboratory. Caitou wasn’t sure what he was looking at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his curiosity piqued by his actions, He Caitou moved over and leaned in to steal a look. He realized there was a furnace which was approximately one meter in diameter on the bench. It was a huge circular furnace four feet deep. Its ancient design looked majestic, and was surrounded by thick walls. There was a lid above which fit perfectly over the furnace. In fact, if not for the experience he had as a Class 8 soul engineer, he would have thought that the lid was part of the furnace. There was simply no crack or lines for any air to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this the outer shell for the soul tool Teacher Xuan tasked Yuhao to build today? Didn’t he promise that Yuhao would definitely not be able to finish it today? Unless Yuhao has pulled off another stunt again?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Caitou’s understanding of Huo Yuhao, he was certain that he would never submit an inferior product just to get things over with. This meant that Huo Yuhao must have completed the product before falling asleep.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder Teacher Xuan seems to have changed his mind on Huo Yuhao...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this very instant, Xuan Ziwen bent down, then leapt up onto the bench. Because the pill furnace was too big, it was impossible to catch a glimpse of the complete thing from below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pill furnace was designed by Xuan Ziwen from scratch. Hence, he naturally knew where all the nooks and crannies were. After tapping some places at the top of the furnace, Xuan Ziwen activated the outer shell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After being activated, the pill furnace released a gush of hot air, which instantly increased the temperature within the room by a few degrees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The look on Xuan Ziwen’s face turned increasingly strange as a look of disbelief slowly replaced his previous look of anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?! How is it possible? I don’t believe it!” If he did not know for a fact that the Tang Sect only had one Class 9 soul engineer—himself—he would have thought that Huo Yuhao had found someone to do it for him. But this was simply impossible. Cultivation ability was not enough to build a complete outer shell. It also required a deep understanding of soul tools. In fact, there were only ten soul engineers that Xuan Ziwen knew who could finish the outer shell in a single day. Most importantly, all of them were in the Sun Moon Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did this brat do it? Unless he’s already become a nine-ringed Titled Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, that’s impossible!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen took a deep breath as he leapt off the bench.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou scrutinized his teacher’s expression and knew his guess was correct. He broke into an awkward smile. “It seems like talent is more important than hard work. Of course, this doesn’t undermine the importance of hard work! Teacher Xuan, you don’t have to say anything to me. I’m going to get my dinner now. You can chat with Yuhao without worrying about me!” After finishing his sentence, Caitou skipped off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he stared at Caitou’s back, Xuan Ziwen also broke into an awkward smile. He was originally the one who had wanted to teach Huo Yuhao a lesson. But somehow, it now seemed like Huo Yuhao would be the one teaching him a lesson!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he thought about this, he could not help but feel a little frustrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While all of this was going on, Huo Yuhao started to wake up. After all, it would have been very difficult for anyone to sleep through this commotion. As he opened his blurry eyes, he noticed Xuan Ziwen standing in the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Teacher Xuan, you’ve returned. What time is it now?” To be honest, Huo Yuhao did not consciously decide to fall asleep. He was just too tired after absorbing all the memories and going through them to learn the technique. His soul felt drained, and hence he fell asleep unknowingly. Of course, all of this was after he had persevered through the task at hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he was fully awake now, the mysterious carving technique still appeared to be flitting before his eyes, as though he was still going through the newly-acquired memories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen’s face did not look very friendly as he asked, “Did you make this outer shell?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded and replied, “Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen asked, “What about the leftover scarlet devil essence?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I put it away over there.” Huo Yuhao pointed towards a corner of the laboratory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen spoke calmly, “Is this the kind of work you submit? I didn’t know you accepted lousy and inferior products.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” Huo Yuhao’s jaw dropped. With his newly learned Rain Dragon’s Dance Carving Technique, the unbelievably sharp Ghostcarving Godly Blade, and his carving skills, the product was perfect in his eyes! In fact, Huo Yuhao believed that this outer shell was the most exquisite soul tool he had ever built.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could it be lousy and inferior?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s getting dark. Let’s go and grab our dinner.” After saying this, Xuan Ziwen turned and left. He did not ask any more questions because he was afraid that his heart might not be able to take it. However, he had completely recognized Huo Yuhao as a student of Shrek Academy in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What a freak! Ahhhhh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During dinnertime, Huo Yuhao bumped into He Caitou, and he noticed how Caitou’s stare was a little more peculiar than usual. Nonetheless, he did not think too much about it. He naturally looked for Tang Wutong the moment Teacher Xuan gave him permission to leave for dinner. With Wutong around, how could he notice anyone else?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After finishing his dinner, Huo Yuhao went over to look for Xuan Ziwen and pleaded cheerfully, “Teacher Xuan, now that I have finished the task you have given me, do you think I can go back to my room to cultivate tonight? You must understand that at the end of the day, I am still a soul master. I must not neglect my own training!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he looked at Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong, who was holding his hand, Xuan Ziwen nodded unwillingly before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even until now, Xuan Ziwen was not fully convinced of Yuhao’s work.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lad must have played a clever trick! There must be something wrong with the outer shell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally did not know what Teacher Xuan was thinking. He was happily galloping away with Tang Wutong back to his room. The scent from Tang Wutong’s body was enough to make him feel very comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s face started to blush as her heart started to beat faster and faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they reached his room, Huo Yuhao quickly closed the door and activated a spiritual barrier, which cut off all connections within the room from the outer world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong naturally knew what he was doing as she took a few steps back in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gave her a naughty laugh. “Have you heard of the story of the big bad wolf and the sheep? Today, the big bad wolf will not let you go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was amused by Huo Yuhao’s words as she burst into laughter. “When a rabbit gets anxious, it will bite too!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s smile became even more wicked as he replied, “Bring it on! I’m not afraid of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he pounced towards Tang Wutong like a hungry wolf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong giggled and stepped aside agilely. Her figure flickered as she completely avoided Huo Yuhao’s pounce. It was a perfect execution of the Tang Sect’s Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track? I know that too.” Huo Yuhao laughed as he increased his speed. Countless figures started to pounce towards Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was shocked beyond belief.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How bad can this guy get?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao not only used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track, but also executed Imitation and Spiritual Interference. This filled the whole room with multiple Huo Yuhaos. It was immensely difficult for Tang Wutong to differentiate between the real and fake ones in such a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, she could not punch them to tell them apart, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, before she could even react, she was already in Huo Yuhao’s embrace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His little sheep was finally in his embrace! Huo Yuhao was unbelievably excited! After they had finally reunited, he had not shared any particularly intimate moments with Tang Wutong. Now that he had finally hugged her, she had nowhere to run or hide. As he gazed at her blushing face, Huo Yuhao found himself unable to resist the temptation before him. Very quickly, he moved his lips towards hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As their lips came closer, it seemed like the room was about to become a stage for the pair of passionate lovers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just when Huo Yuhao’s lips were about a millimeter away from Wutong’s, Huo Yuhao felt a frightening aura from her body, following which, a golden light flashed before his eyes as he was thrown across the room and into the wall by a powerful force. After colliding with the wall at the far end of the room, he slid down the surface of the wall like a wall painting that was falling off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This force not only acted on his body, but also impacted his soul. He felt as though he had just suffered a spiritual attack—something he was not unfamiliar with. His body felt as though it had just been rammed by a mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pain that was rippling through his soul and body turned Huo Yuhao’s face into a wrinkled mess.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">W-What just happened…?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A scream escaped from Tang Wutong’s mouth as she flew over to Huo Yuhao’s side to help him up.</span></p>
