 <p>Hey guys, after a month of really hard work, I'm excited that <strong>our new VIP system and in-house ebook system is now alive and functioning</strong>! &nbsp;You can now purchase and permanently own full ebooks in PDF/Mobi/epub versions, as you please, and read them on whatever devices you like. &nbsp;You can take a look at it <a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/profile/vip" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>right here</u></a> to see all the details, or just click on the big 'VIP' button. &nbsp;NOTE - For former sponsors of completed novels who qualify for free ebooks or discounts, you'll be seeing them in your 'my ebooks' library...</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was in a daze as she looked at Huo Yuhao not far from her. Right now, for some reason, she felt that the distance between him and her was so far that it was unbridgeable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong took in a deep breath and tried to get rid of that feeling. However, everything was in vain. She knew that she wouldn’t be able to forget the look in his eyes as he gazed at Wang Dong’er. She was now immersed in Wang Dong’er’s world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the golden projection in the sky slowly dimmed down as Huo Yuhao looked on reluctantly. The night sky became quiet once again, and all of Shrek Academy seemed to quiet down with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this even humanly possible? How did he do this?,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;were the questions in every student’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the more experienced inner courtyard students and teachers could roughly guess that it was the most advanced self-invented soul skill of a soul master. Only the most outstanding soul masters could do something like this. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao’s self-invented soul skill fused his martial soul, soul power, and spiritual power. It even contained his emotions, his yearning for Wang Dong’er!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Fist of Remembrance, a fist containing a surging feeling of remembrance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yearning in Huo Yuhao’s eyes was slowly withdrawn. What replaced it was a deep look. He looked at Bai Se again and nodded to her, “Do you still want to challenge me now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bai Se laughed bitterly and shook her head. She replied, “Although I knew that the gap between you and me was huge, I didn’t expect it to be that huge. I’ve already lost my courage to challenge you. I’ll consider it again when I have the courage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she finished speaking, she paused for a moment and took a serious look at Huo Yuhao before saying, “However, senior, did you know? After you demonstrated this move, I’ve become even more curious about you. I’ve even developed an admiration for you. To me, admiration should be the precondition for love. I won't give up easily, I’ll work harder to understand you. I heard that you’re from the Tang Sect. After I graduate, I want to join the Tang Sect!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “The Tang Sect welcomes you, and I accept your challenge anytime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Bai Se answered. After this, she turned to Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo and said with a high-pitched voice, “Seniors, I’ve already decided to pull out of this Fated Blind Date. After seeing what Senior Yuhao has demonstrated, I’m only keen on cultivating further. I’ll make a move first.” After she finished speaking, she jumped away and proceeded towards the shore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;After watching her leave, Zhang Lexuan revealed a frustrated look on her face. She thought to herself,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao is too charismatic. He can ‘infect’ anyone everywhere he goes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already turned his attention to number eleven, Su Tong. Su Tong still had her bamboo hat and veil over her head, the veil still covering her face. At least on the surface, no one could tell what her feelings were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, Huo Yuhao’s seven soul rings slowly winked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t you want to demonstrate your abilities to me ,too? What I want to see are not your self-invented soul skills.” Su Tong said to Huo Yuhao in a high-pitched voice. However, if she could hear her voice right now, she would definitely be stunned to discover that she lacked some of the self-confidence she normally possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at her and said, “I’ll satisfy you, then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soul rings started to rise from Huo Yuhao’s body again. However, everyone was shocked to find out that the soul rings that re-emerged weren’t the same color as they were before. They were different now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of the seven soul rings that rose earlier, the first one was white. This time, the first soul ring to rise was red, blood-red! It was as red as Shrek Academy’s uniform, even deeper and darker! It was a red that represented strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hundred-thousand-year soul ring!” many people exclaimed in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What followed were the rest of Huo Yuhao’s soul rings. They left everyone in complete shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were seven more soul rings after the first one, four orange and three red ones. In total, there were eight soul rings. Half were orange, and half were red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A red soul ring was a hundred-thousand-year soul ring. This was basic knowledge that every soul master knew. But what did orange represent? The students from Shrek Academy, whether they were from the inner or outer courtyards, had never heard of orange soul rings before. They didn’t even know what an orange soul ring represented. Everyone was flabbergasted. They looked at Huo Yuhao like he was a freak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gradually lit up with a jade-green glow. All eight soul rings were quietly drifting around him. The clear water of the Sea God’s Lake started to crystallize at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, a tough icy layer spread all the way beneath the feet of both the male and female students on Sea God’s Lake. As the surface beneath them hardened, they were able to relax in controlling their soul power. The speed of the crystallization was even increasing. In just a matter of seconds, the entire Sea God’s Lake rippled with a layer of icy fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, Sea God’s Lake had frozen up. The entirety of Sea God’s Lake was covered with ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature in the air dipped significantly in just a short period of time. Everyone could sense the intense chill. However, the outer courtyard students could still handle the chill, as the chill only came from the surface of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without even using a soul skill or performing any visible action, Huo Yuhao managed to freeze the entire Sea God’s Lake. Although Sea God’s Lake wasn’t a true lake, it was still expansive. How easy was it to freeze the whole thing?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Huo Yuhao had unleashed eight soul rings, and the color of every soul ring was astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The students of Shrek had all heard that he had twin martial souls. However, it was their first time seeing twin martial souls with their own eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had two martial souls. One was seven-ringed, and the other was eight-ringed. He was a Soul Douluo, a Soul Douluo who was barely twenty years old!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao was only a myth in the Academy in the past, he was now transforming according to the myth right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Elder Xuan was astonished. “Since when did this fellow have eight soul rings? They’re even hundred-thousand-year soul rings!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe took this opportunity to say, “Elder Xuan, now do you believe that he doesn’t have to wait until the future to replace me, right? He can just directly take over from you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao calmly said to Su Tong, who was standing where she was without saying anything or moving an inch, “If you can turn the lake back into water, you win. You should know that ice-type controllers like us take control of temperature first. I’m not taking advantage of you in any way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Tong nodded silently. However, she didn’t say anything before suddenly jumping up and heading. Everyone around knew that she couldn’t undo what Huo Yuhao had managed to do so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned to Zhang Lexuan and Han Ruoruo and said, “Seniors, let’s leave the lake frozen. It will melt slowly on its own. It’ll also make things easier for the other students of this Fated Blind Date. Apologies for taking everyone’s time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded at the male and female students to acknowledge them.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I should be able to leave now. The Academy invited me over because they wanted me to demonstrate my abilities and inspire everyone to cultivate. I’ve helped them achieve their goal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait a minute.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao appeared slightly dissatisfied as he was halted once again. He wasn’t in a good mood right now. He was starting to become a little angry as he was stopped over and over again. However, his anger dissipated when he saw the person who had halted him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no more complicated look in Tang Wutong’s eyes now. Her determined gaze was flashing with golden light. Even though she wasn’t Wang Dong’er, she still looked very similar to her. No matter what, Huo Yuhao couldn’t bring himself to be angry with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve already demonstrated your abilities to them. What about me?” Tang Wutong said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow and asked, “Tang Wutong, are you challenging me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why not, since the rules allow it?” Tang Wutong replied calmly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and replied, “But I don’t want to fight you. I’m not in the mood, either. You should know that I won’t hurt you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “What if I insist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes flashed, and he said coldly, “How do you want to fight, then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong revealed a smile. It seemed rather weird. It appeared to be a teasing smile, but very uncomfortable, too. When the two expressions came together, it indeed made her smile appear a little odd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart skipped a beat when he saw her smile. For some reason, he felt something was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “Forget it, I don’t want to fight you either. Although I don’t think that I’ll lose to you, you taught me that day that I shouldn’t bite the hand that fed me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want, then?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong replied, “Do you still remember our time in the Star Luo Empire? Back then, you used your soul power to check my power before you left. I agreed to your request back then. Right now, I want to do the same to you. I want to try what you did. Is that considered fair? I’ve already let you check me. If you want to leave, you can do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Huo Yuhao didn’t expect Tang Wutong to make such a request. He was a little confused, as he couldn’t figure out what her goal was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why, are you scared?” Tang Wutong looked a little provocative as she stared at him.</span></p>
