 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sect leader, you also know that it’s difficult to cultivate my Demonic Maggot. It’s not that I’m not working hard. It’s just that my Demonic Maggot hasn’t been able to gain anything from devouring the spirits of ordinary humans after I became a Titled Douluo. I can only achieve something if I devour the spirit of a Titled Douluo. Why don’t you give me some resources when the war continues?” the Masquerade Douluo laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu furrowed his brow and said, “Enough with that. The church still has uses for the spirits of Titled Douluo. Even if your Demonic Maggot devours their spirits, it will take more then just one or two to help you improve. It’s such a waste. Although we are evil soul masters, stop trying to use shortcuts to achieve your goal. Work hard on your cultivation, you can improve in that way too. Look at Nangong. He’s already Rank 93 now. When he reaches Rank 94, the church will turn resources toward him and quickly help him become a Transcendent Douluo. If you stay in your current state, you can only remain as one of the lousier elders we have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I’ll work harder,” the Masquerade Douluo said a little awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can go.” Zhongli Wu gestured again. The Masquerade Douluo felt as if he had been given a big let off, and walked out with Nangong Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After exiting the commander’s tent, Nangong Wan and the Masquerade Douluo looked at each other. The originally sinister look in the Masquerade Douluo’s eyes became clearer, and he nodded gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan led him toward the left. Their tents were not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The real Masquerade Douluo had died at Elder Song’s hands. Without a doubt, the Masquerade Douluo now was an imitation. Huo Yuhao was imitating him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhongli Wu had called out to him earlier, Huo Yuhao had tensed up. He clearly knew that if he was exposed in such a core area of the base, he would find it extremely difficult to escape from the sect leader of the Holy Ghost Church, even if he had the protection of Di Tian’s reverse scale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, he had found out some details on the Masquerade Douluo from Nangong Wan before he came her, and had managed to bluff his way through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan sent the Masquerade Douluo to his tent before speaking through his soul power, “When are you going to remove my restrictions?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “When we finish this mission, we’ll remove the restrictions. Shrek Academy isn’t the Holy Ghost Church. We’ll keep our promises. As long as you cooperate with us, we won’t hurt you. We’ll even help you keep up the pretense. When you finish this mission, you’ll be free to continue being an elder of the Holy Ghost Church. Of course, whatever you want to do in the future, it’ll be your business. However, if you continue to harm others, you’ll land in our hands again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan laughed bitterly as he nodded. He pointed to Huo Yuhao’s tent before turning and leaving. He didn’t fully trust Huo Yuhao. However, not believing Huo Yuhao didn’t mean that he didn’t believe Shrek Academy. Shrek Academy’s reputation on the continent was very notable. Earlier, Yan Shaozhe and Elder Song had guaranteed that he would be given his freedom if he helped them complete this mission. Right now, the restrictions in Nangong Wan’s body were placed by Huo Yuhao using necromancy after Yan Shaozhe sucked away his soul power. In fact, the restrictions weren’t lethal, but they would be very painful if they were triggered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Huo Yuhao’s cultivation wasn’t too far off from his. These restrictions would only last for three days, too. Of course, Nangong Wan didn’t know all this. He only knew that his spiritual sea was in excruciating pain when he tested the restrictions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao bent over and entered his tent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil soul masters were treated very well in this camp, and the tent was very large. However, Huo Yuhao’s expression immediately changed when stepped in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a strong fragrance in the Masquerade Douluo’s tent. This fragrance carried the smell of aphrodisiac. Not only that, but there was also a sinister aura that accompanied it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir, you’re back,” a soft-spoken voice was heard. Two simply-dressed young girls received him immediately. Their faces were slightly red, and their breathing carried the aura of aphrodisiacs. Evidently, they were being influenced by those drugs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two young girls were very pretty, but the look in their eyes was hollow. It was like they had lost their souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Stay away from me. Put your clothes on. I don’t need your services today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The two girls were stunned, but they didn’t dare to say anything, and immediately dressed up before leaving when they felt the killing intent coming from Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they left, the tent immediately smelled more refreshing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pulled the curtains open to get rid of the smell. Although he only had a brief interaction with both girls earlier, he could still feel that the aphrodisiacs came from their bodies. This meant that their bodies had been modified. The way that the Holy Ghost Church harmed people could really make one bristle with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t use his Spiritual Detection to observe his surroundings. He was in a very important area of the base. Everyone from the Holy Ghost Church stayed within this core region. Defense was undoubtedly very tight in such a region. If there was a spiritual barrier or a powerful individual around, he would immediately be detected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why Huo Yuhao only looked out from his windows after pulling his curtains open and sensing his surroundings. After fresher air circulated through his tent, he immediately shut the windows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The decorations inside this tent were quite classy. There was a huge carpet made out of animal fur laying on the ground, and a huge bed in the center of the tent. In the front, there was a table, a sofa and daily tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After sending the two young girls out, Huo Yuhao wasn’t afraid of the Holy Ghost Church suspecting anything. Earlier, Zhongli Wu had told him to stop being so obsessed with sex. He was only listening to orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After closing the curtains, the entire tent became much quieter, and it was much dimmer. There were only a few dim soul lamps still on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil soul masters didn’t enjoy bright environments. Such dimness gave off a very sinister feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t get onto the bed. The Masquerade Douluo must have had been on it with many young girls, and it felt too dirty. He pulled out a chair and sat down on it. After that, he carefully unleashed his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Spiritual Detection was limited to his tent, but every single nook and cranny was within his detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to make sure that this place was fine before he proceeded with the next step of his operation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few minutes later, he opened his eyes once again and nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is more like where an evil Titled Douluo should stay. There aren’t any surveillance precautions taken in this tent, and there are also no surveillance soul tools covering it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was great news. Huo Yuhao unleashed his soul power once again. This time, he formed a spiritual barrier and isolated the inside of the tent from the rest of the outside world. He would immediately discover if someone tried to use their spiritual power in this tent. It was just like when he was discovered by a barrier before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After completing this set-up, Huo Yuhao started to mutter incantations. His voice was very soft. Unless one were in the same room, it would be impossible to hear him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Masquerade Douluo was also partially adept at spiritual power, so it was easier for Huo Yuhao to keep up his false appearance if he imitated him. The evil soul master aura of the Masquerade Douluo could be imitated, while his spiritual power wasn’t any weaker than the Masquerade Douluo’s was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he started chanting, the space in front of him started to distort. Halos flashed, and a pitch-black door slowly opened in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao verified that no one had breached his spiritual barrier before he took a step into that door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">----------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He came out into another dimension, his spectral demiplane.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a bare mountain, Elder Song, Yan Shaozhe and everyone from the Tang Sect was waiting for him. In addition to them, there was also the Ice Bear King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone from the Tang Sect had entered Huo Yuhao’s spectral demiplane. They didn’t have too much of a reaction when they first entered, but Yan Shaozhe and Elder Song were both astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They hadn’t expected Huo Yuhao to be capable of this. Because they were very well-informed, they understood what a demiplane meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song and Yan Shaozhe immediately realized where the spectral army came from when they were fighting the Great Star Dou Forest, and they saw the boundless sea of spectres.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, neither of them had asked any questions about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Huo Yuhao’s plan, there was no way he could rescue Tang Ya alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya’s current abilities were unknown. However, they knew she was at least an evil Soul Sage. Huo Yuhao couldn’t harm her, either. It was impossible to capture her quickly. Furthermore, any movement in this base would be immediately discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had no choice but to expose his spectral demiplane to them, and let everyone rest inside it. When he entered it, it meant that everyone had assembled. Right now, the first step of the plan had been completed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is it, Yuhao?” Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded lightly and recounted everything that had happened to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song nodded and said, “Alright, take care then. You don’t have to worry about us. We’ll be waiting for you. When you think the time is right, we’ll begin the mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao had entered to say hi to everyone, and tell them that he had successfully snuck into the Sun Moon Empire’s base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe furrowed his brow and said, “Yuhao, you should expedite your plan. The longer you stay there, the more you run the risk of being exposed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao acknowledged once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song laughed, “Shaozhe, I think you’ve yet to acclimate to the environment here.”</span></p>
