 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Titled Douluo’s face was covered in ash from the explosion. Although his limbs weren’t blown off, the shirt he was wearing was in tatters now. He spat out blood in the air, which quickly froze before falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both he and that frail soul master were evil soul masters. When evil soul masters were influenced by their own evil strength, they would become very self-centered. Naturally, the Titled Douluo couldn’t bother with the other soul master right now. As he tried to stabilize himself in the air, he quickly unleashed a defensive soul skill and hid within a layer of thick greyish fog. At the same time, he quickly retreated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other soul master couldn’t adapt at all. As he was critically hurt, he was already falling from the sky. He was flailing as he tried to circulate his soul power and control his body. However, he couldn’t do it in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, he suddenly a chill down his entire body. This chill didn’t come from the temperature of the outside world; it originated from his own senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a spiritual-type Soul Douluo who was also an evil soul master, his senses had always been very acute. When this feeling came, he realized that something was amiss. He desperately screamed, “Save me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder who was rapidly retreating heard his call the moment he exited the radius of the remaining shockwaves of the explosion. After hearing the calls, he was furious. It was because of him that they were caught in the ambush!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aren’t you just falling from the sky? Don’t tell me you’ll fall to death even though you’re a Soul Douluo? Why are you screaming so loud? Even if you’re hurt badly, your injuries aren’t lethal.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder had no intention of saving him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was also at this moment that he was shocked to find out that the dark sky seemed to have slightly distorted in an area a little ways away from the man in black. A beam of golden light flashed out before it penetrated into the head of the frail man in black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The frail man’s body quickly shriveled up as he fell from the sky, and that golden light also revealed its true appearance. It was a long spear, bladed on both ends. The spear exuded blinding, petrifying golden light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Disastrous!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Titled Douluo seemed to have realized something. His figure quickly flashed away as he charged straight towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That beam of golden light vanished in the next instant. There seemed to be a distorted figure that flashed away. In the next moment, everything returned to normal once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scoundrel!” The Titled Douluo shouted furiously, a huge patch of thick greyish fog pursuing that distorted figure. Wherever it passed, blasting sounds resonated through the air. However, his attacks were futile. He could only hit the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When that frail man in black was killed, he realized that the enemy’s target was that actually that frail man in black. The reason was very simple: he was adept at spiritual abilities!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the start until the end, they had not seen the appearance of the attacker. However, without a doubt, this enemy was a spiritual-type soul master. Of course, in the eyes of the Titled Douluo, the attacker was a spiritual-type Titled Douluo. To this enemy, the elder wasn’t the true threat, because he could conceal himself from the elder. Even given the elder’s cultivation, and even if he unleashed all his senses, he could only discover his enemy within a certain range.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, that Soul Douluo was different. With him around, it was like having an extra pair of eyes, much easier dealing with the spiritual-type Titled Douluo. Obviously, the spiritual-type Titled Douluo wanted to kill the Soul Douluo, because that would greatly reduce their ability to suppress him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were very few spiritual-type martial souls in the world of soul masters. There weren’t also very few spiritual-type soul masters, even in the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were more spiritual-type evil soul masters compared to ordinary soul masters. However, in just a few years, three of them had already died. It was important to know that these evil soul masters were very crucial to the Holy Ghost Church, even though they had very weird temperaments. This Rank 87 spiritual-type Soul Douluo had now died. How could they possibly catch the attacker now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">----------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person who had killed the Soul Douluo was indeed Huo Yuhao. After he charged out from the palace, he found the most appropriate time to use his Ice Explosion Technique with the help of his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for turning back to attack, it was originally not in his plan. He had only thought of that idea on the spur of the moment. He didn’t intend to deal with the frail man initially. After all, it was his first time seeing him and sensing his threat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took action because he wanted to act when his Ice Explosion Technique was the most effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He controlled his Ice Explosion Technique with the help of his Spiritual Detection. Huo Yuhao didn’t flee too far initially. He stopped and turned back, and stayed just outside the palace walls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had returned was because he saw the Titled Douluo elder abandoning his partner, leaving him exposed.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wasn’t fit to be called an Ultimate Soldier if he didn’t seize such an opportunity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Throwing the Golden Dragon Spear from afar was Wang Qiu’er’s ultimate skill. Huo Yuhao wasn’t as strong as her, but he wasn’t weak either, after fusing with the soul rings she had turned into. Furthermore, he had strengths that she didn’t have.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why did the Golden Dragon Spear appear after the Titled Douluo saw a distortion in the dark sky?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because Huo Yuhao had used his Imitation on the Golden Dragon Spear just as he threw it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t just a simple use of his spiritual-type soul skill. It involved attention to detail. The process was very complex.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, he had to leave a streak of his spiritual sense and spiritual power on the Golden Dragon Spear. He could only do this after his spiritual power materialized. In addition, he was only able to complete such a rapid fusion of his soul and spiritual powers after he had formed his soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, he imprinted his Imitation onto the streak of spiritual power and used it just as he threw the Golden Dragon Spear out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simply speaking, his Imitation was actually unleashed through his Golden Dragon Spear, completely concealing it in the darkness. It only revealed itself when it arrived in front of the frail man in black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even after it appeared, it was fully under Huo Yuhao’s control, as he still had to ensure that his spiritual power continued to move the Golden Dragon Spear and complete the attack. The Golden Dragon Spear thus absorbed the life energy of the frail man, which was directly drawn away by Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power. On the Golden Dragon Spear, it was like an avatar with its own spiritual power and life energy. This avatar controlled the spear to return to him as fast as possible. As it flew back, Huo Yuhao’s Imitation was unleashed again, allowing the Golden Dragon Spear to move like the wind and instantly conceal itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s attack actually drained a lot of his effort, even though it was just a simple strike. It was only completed through his immense spiritual control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the elder, he had discovered Huo Yuhao too late. How could it be easy for him to pursue him now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The immense soul power undulations caused by the Ice Explosion Technique didn’t just blow apart all the surveillance soul tools in this region of the palace, but it also caused great interference to the aerial surveillance soul tools in the air. It was only possible to locate Huo Yuhao using another spiritual-type soul master at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao moved through multiple streets and alleys as he took cover in the darkness. He only stopped after he was sure he was in a safe place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, his breathing was a little quick. However, there was an excited look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimate Soldier! This was a true Ultimate Soldier! Sneaking into the enemy’s base, killing an influential figure and fleeing far away. From the start until the end, he wasn’t even exposed. The enemy didn’t even know who had made the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This feeling was great!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his earlier all-around surveillance in the Heavenly Soul Empire’s Imperial Palace, Huo Yuhao had already clearly found out that there was only one spiritual-type soul master in the entire palace. It was that guy. Without any soul tools, that guy wasn’t able to pose a threat to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although spiritual surveillance soul tools could locate him, they still had to be controlled by soul engineers. Compared to soul masters, they weren’t very adaptable. Moreover, they couldn’t track him. Unless the enemy could use spiritual surveillance soul tools in conjunction with oscillation and thermal detectors, as well as lock onto his position the moment he was detected, there was no way he could be detected, given current soul tool technology.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had always been monitoring the Sun Moon Empire’s soul tool technology throughout this period of war, and was very confident in his own judgment in this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he landed in Ju Zi’s trap the last time, it was because he had been too careless. He had underestimated the Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion, which ended up exposing him. But it was a good lesson. At least he wouldn’t allow himself to be exposed in the future when it came to similar situations.</span></p>
