 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the message wasn’t very clear, Xu Tianran could clearly sense the rage in it. Evidently, things were getting unstable at the front line. This was something that he really didn’t want to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Projection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” A black figure silently appeared behind Xu Tianran. Even though the lighting was very bright, he still appeared illusory. His appearance wasn’t clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Gather more information on the Holy Ghost Church. This is a secret mission. Do not be discovered. Ask the legion commander of the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineer Legion to find me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Your Majesty.” The black figure silently retreated before disappearing into a dark corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A light flashed in Xu Tianran’s hand. The paper that had recorded the message was instantly crushed before it disappeared. He had already made a decision by now. His rage dissipated a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Holy Ghost Church, what a Holy Ghost Church. Since you’ve already become a disobedient dog, don’t blame me for being vicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only reason why Xu Tianran hesitated a little was because of the two Ultimate Douluo. However, he had done detailed background research on Long Xiaoyao and Ye Xishui. Their ages were already a problem, not to even mention anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those from the same generation as them were all already dead. They were considered the oldest among humans. They were both more than two hundred years old. They might die at any time. Ultimate Douluo weren’t immortals, unless they could reach their way into a higher realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether the godly realm existed was a big question. However, from their current condition, it seemed unlikely that they were going to the godly realm.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi, if things are fine on your side, you just need to wait a few more years until those two are dead. It won’t be a problem to attack the Holy Ghost Church then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, Sanshi, why are you back?” Bei Bei was astonished when he saw Xu Sanshi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shouldn’t you be at Dou Ling City? Our Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion has already been sent over. Why are you back? Why are all of you back?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei was astonished as he looked at all his teammates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi chuckled and said, “Who’s willing to remain at that place? I’m about to go crazy. Bei Bei, listen to me and you’ll understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recounted how Huo Yuhao and the rest had managed to enter Dou Ling City, and explained how he had managed to stabilize it. He also mentioned how he was a prince, as well as the various obstacles they had faced there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing his recount, Bei Bei’s expression immediately turned gloomy. The internal problems in Dou Ling City had prevented Xu Sanshi from strutting his stuff. They were still experiencing internal chaos at such a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei only looked slightly more relieved when Xu Sanshi mentioned that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong had saved them at the most critical of times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are really useless too. All of you can’t even deal with five Titled Douluo. Sanshi, it’s not a bad idea for you to return either. Go and cultivate. Don’t come out until you’ve become a Titled Douluo.” Bei Bei snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi snorted and replied, “Do you think it’s very easy to become a Titled Douluo? Eh, surely not. Don’t tell me you’re…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei chuckled, and was a little pleased as he said, “I’m feeling great. For some reason, my cultivation speed has increased significantly ever since Xiao Ya was treated. It has improved by leaps and bounds. Xiao Ya has also made a breakthrough. She just went to the Spirit Pagoda a few days ago and fused with the Bluesilver Emperor. Now, we have two more Titled Douluo in the Tang Sect. That’s why all of you must work harder. Alright, if little junior and Wutong appeared at the same time, does that mean Wutong is completely well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi was depressed as he looked at Bei Bei. Their cultivations had been similar all this while. Now that Bei Bei had become a Titled Douluo, he was really dealt a huge blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Wutong is not only well, but she has even made a breakthrough with little junior. From little junior’s words, it seems like they are both Transcendent Douluo. You are only a Titled Douluo. What’s there to flaunt? Nannan, let’s go and make breakthroughs too. This time, I won’t come out until I become a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait a minute.” Bei Bei pulled Xu Sanshi to one side and asked him about everything that had happened in Dou Ling City in detail once again. After he verified that the Tang Sect Soul Engineer Legion had arrived and Xue Lingxun was there to help, he let Xu Sanshi go. However, he didn’t allow him to cultivate as of yet. He pulled him to Shrek Academy first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important to let the academy know what was happening in the Dou Ling Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things in Shrek City were much more relaxed after the Sun Moon Empire left. The elites from the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires also retreated. Shrek City had already regained its peace. Of course, this was all on the surface. No one knew when the Sun Moon Empire’s army would appear once again. They also didn’t know who their next target was. Given the situation in the continent, none of them could really relax their guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 22pt"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha!” Soft laughter sounded. Ju Zi covered her small mouth and couldn’t help but laugh again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two people in front of her. They were completely covered by fiery-red human-shaped soul tools. Only their helmets were off, revealing their facial appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One was the captivating and awe-inspiring Tang Wutong. Her long pinkish-blue hair and fiery-red human-shaped soul tool were in contrast. This made her seem even more ravishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other person was more interesting. Huo Yuhao was the other person in the human-shaped soul tool. He hadn’t put on makeup yet. However, the human-shaped soul tools of the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion were designed according to the figure of a female!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although this human-shaped soul tool that Ju Zi had obtained for Huo Yuhao had once belonged to a female soul engineer with a rather big build, there was still a big difference between a female and male figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, the chest armor was poking out slightly, and was fiery-red. When Huo Yuhao wore it, it did seem slightly weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Tang Wutong couldn’t help but laugh softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s so funny? I can just not wear it, can I? I can just use my Imitation to produce one.” Huo Yuhao snapped and was about to strip off the human-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t! Didn’t you mention that extremely strong individuals will be able to realize if you change your figure or conceal yourself? Furthermore, I don’t know what new soul tools there are in Radiant City. So, it’s better for you to wear it. We won’t laugh at you anymore. Once you put on the helmet, who would know you are inside?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, it’s really too much!” Huo Yuhao said, furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha!” Tang Wutong couldn’t hold it in anymore. She burst out laughing. How ridiculous was it for a guy to wear a female human-shaped soul tool? Even if he wore the helmet, they still knew that he was the one inside!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao glared at Tang Wutong as if he was telling her that he would deal with her when they returned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi rushed a few steps forward, as she was afraid that he would go back on his word. She personally helped him wear his helmet, covering his appearance. It was much better after she covered his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong smiled as she said, “What an awe-inspiring female warrior. You look pretty good just like this.” As she spoke, she also wore her helmet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This human-shaped soul tool had no effect on Tang Wutong. All the human-shaped soul tools of the Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion were enhanced by fire, and were equipped with all types of fire-type soul tools. Although Tang Wutong didn’t possess fire-type soul power, her light-type soul power could still demonstrate some fire-type characteristics. This was why she could use this soul tool too. Although it didn’t enhance her a lot, it didn’t weaken her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was more tragic. Not only did this human-shaped soul tool not fit him, but it also contradicted his Ultimate Ice soul power, even though he could control it using his spiritual power. He would not feel comfortable in it at all. He only felt better by changing to his Spirit Eyes. However, there was nothing in it to help his agility.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, let’s do it like this. Both of you will follow me at all times, as if you are my bodyguards. You can trust all my bodyguards. No one will suspect you if you don’t say anything.” Ju Zi said seriously to Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Of course, she still couldn’t hide the amusement in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao decided not to speak anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi walked in front of Huo Yuhao and smiled. “Do you think I’m acting against my own interests? We are clearly enemies, but we’re teaming up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The army moved very quickly. When equipped with all types of soul tools, they were proceeding faster than other armies from the three empires of the original Douluo Continent. Some of the carriages were propelled using Milk Bottles, and they could even carry quite a lot of soldiers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few days of observation, Huo Yuhao gained a deeper understanding of the Sun Moon Empire’s advantage in terms of soul tool technology. Just like he had expected, more and more of the Sun Moon Empire’s soul tool technology was being used on ordinary people now. Even though Milk Bottles were expensive and could only be operated through the soul power of soul masters, it was no longer a dream for ordinary people to become soul masters in the future, given that there was such a beginning already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the Sun Moon Empire’s real advantage. No wonder Ju Zi dared to promise not to attack the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires in the next ten years after he killed Xu Tianran. She was confident! The two empires wouldn’t catch up in terms of soul tool technology within ten years. They couldn’t even gather enough resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whether it was the mining and purification of rare metals or soul tool production, the Sun Moon Empire had too much of an advantage. Although Shrek Academy was doing its best to catch up, it was impossible for an academy to challenge the likes of an entire empire!</span></p>
