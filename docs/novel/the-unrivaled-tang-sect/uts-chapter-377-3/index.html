The hostages were in a worse situation than they had thought, which made their rescue mission much more difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked Feng Ling a few more questions, but it was obvious that Feng Ling’s state of mind had declined once again, as his words became very unclear. The information that they obtained only consisted of what Feng Ling had revealed earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was still very valuable to the Tang Sect. At least they knew where the hostages were behind held. Indeed, they were being watched by evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this way, they had a direct target for their upcoming mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After exiting Feng Ling’s room, Huo Yuhao immediately gathered his teammates for a meeting. After this, he recounted what Feng Ling had said to him earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We must start planning our rescue mission. Let me give my suggestion before all of you add on.” Huo Yuhao couldn’t be bothered with remaining hidden anymore, given the crisis they were experiencing in Sunrise City. A missing evil soul master was bound to alert the Holy Ghost Church. This was why they had to act as soon as possible. According to Huo Yuhao’s estimation, the fight near the border over these few days was becoming more intense. They had the biggest chance of success if they exploited this opportunity to rescue the hostages. This was because the Holy Ghost Church was likely to send some strong soul masters to supplement their forces at the border.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We have limited people and resources. That’s why we can’t do everything. From what Feng Ling has told us, the Holy Ghost Church has already started to lay their hands on the hostages. A portion of the hostages were even taken to a different place, and we all know what will happen to them. Even if there are survivors, I’m afraid their lives are like a living hell. We can only give up on this portion of the hostages.” Huo Yuhao looked very stern as he said this, and his tone also sounded very determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu stood up and glared at him furiously. Her eyes seemed to be on the verge of spewing fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sit down!” Huo Yuhao shouted. His voice didn’t sound very loud, but it had an indescribable might to it. Along with the fact that he had killed a Soul Douluo on his own, Nan Qiuqiu turned pale when he shouted at her, and she sat down uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know what you want to say. Qiuqiu, I know you don’t want anything to happen to your mother, but you have to know that our overall abilities can’t compare to the Holy Ghost Church. The Academy only sent us here because we aren’t obvious targets. That’s why we can only do what we are capable of. If we successfully rescue most of the hostages and your mother isn’t among them, I promise you that I’ll stay with you until we find her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, we need to save the majority first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu was stunned, and silently lowered her head. She knew that this was the best Huo Yuhao could do. With his immense spiritual power, it was also the most effective if he remained with her to search for her mother. Right now, she could only pray that her mother was with the majority of the hostages. While she was a proud lady, she wasn’t unreasonable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that he had convinced Nan Qiuqiu, Huo Yuhao turned to the rest and continued, saying, “I’ll immediately survey the region Feng Ling mentioned, and I’ll try to sneak in. While I get some first-hand information, all of you must be prepared to take action. Second senior, you can start our arrangements over here. Whatever you need me to set up, you can separate and pass to me. I’m confident of leaving and entering the city without being detected.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Third senior, you are adept at controlling water. You should follow me to the water prison and reinforce me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Xu Sanshi nodded as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were older than Huo Yuhao, they treated him as their leader right now. This was extremely wise, considering that they were in a dangerous place right now, and it was pertinent for them to have a common voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister Ziyan, starting from now, install the items that I passed to you earlier at the north region of the city when it’s dark. These high altitude surveillance soul tools are the least effective at night. However, you must still remain careful. If you are discovered, you must immediately escape. If possible, try to install as many as possible. They will provide us with opportunities during our mission.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, count on me.” Jing Ziyan gave Huo Yuhao a thumbs-up to signal that she understood. She was given this role because of the abilities of her Fog. She could turn into fog and escape anytime she wanted. Compared to the rest, she could make the safest escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao then turned to Ji Juechen. “Brother Ji, you are in charge of reinforcing Sister Ziyan. You must guarantee her safety.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He nodded coolly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s gaze finally landed on Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi, “The two of you will remain in the hotel and guard Feng Ling. Also, please protect second senior as he sets everything up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi was a little displeased. “Do you need both of us to remain here to guard one person? Going to the water prison will be very dangerous. I can tag along as extra reinforcement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t completely trust Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu yet. They had both just joined the Tang Sect and there were still many things that they were not completely sturdy in. In the face of a crisis, it was very difficult to tell what kinds of abilities they would unleash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Ye Guyi’s Holy Angel was still very important. It was an effective weapon against evil soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pondering for a moment, Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “Alright. Qiuqiu will remain here, while Guyi will follow me and third senior. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time was not on their side. For now, the Sun Moon Empire was more focused on their borders. While the water prison was under the protection of the Holy Ghost Church, the security of this prison wouldn’t be as tight as compared to before. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao and the rest didn’t have to risk their lives to fight their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to Feng Ling’s description, the water prison was beneath the city’s moat at the south wall. However, Huo Yuhao didn’t leave the city to survey it. Without a doubt, the strength of the surveillance soul tools above this moat were bound to be the strongest. If he used his spiritual power to seal his soul power, he couldn’t use his Imitation. However, he couldn’t openly try to enter the prison either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, Huo Yuhao, Xu Sanshi and Ye Guyi didn’t leave the city. Instead, they proceeded to the south wall from inside the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sunrise City wasn’t very big, but the three of them still needed to make a slight detour before they got close to the south wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the hotel, Nan Qiuqiu was bored as she guarded Feng Ling. After he ate, he fell asleep. As she sat in a chair, there was a worried look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She kept on praying for her mother, and hoped that she was fine. She also knew that Huo Yuhao didn’t bring her along because of her unstable state of mind. It was evidently an accurate decision to leave her behind. However, she was extremely anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the room, Feng Ling unwittingly let out a few groans as he flipped his body around while sleeping. Suddenly, his body jerked, and a trace of dark-red light flashed above his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nan Qiuqiu naturally didn’t see this, as she was outside the room. After the dark-red light flashed, he soon became normal again. His body turned rigid for a moment before he relaxed and continued sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In another room, which was also the largest room that they had booked in this hotel, He Caitou was busy setting everything up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every corner of the roof was stuck with starfish-shaped soul tools. There was a red spot of light at the center of each starfish-shaped soul tool, and they were slowly flashing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were called surveillance-interference soul tools, newly invented by Xuan Ziwen. They were targeted towards all types of surveillance soul tools, and were able to shield against the effects of most surveillance soul tools apart from thermal detectors. They were especially useful against soul power detectors, and the only problem was that each of them only covered a limited area. This was why many of them had to be used at the same time. Right now, any soul power undulations that came from this room couldn’t be detected by the surveillance soul tools outside no matter how many of them there were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for thermal detectors, they were extremely rare and huge. They couldn’t be used on the streets for a patrol. Even if they could be carried around on the streets, what good would they do even if they detected people in the hotel?</span></p>

To ensure their safety, Bei Bei and Xuan Ziwen had used up every resource that the Tang Sect had. Xuan Ziwen even wanted to hand everything to them.</span></p>

It had a hexagonal base, and the top of it was carved with many complicated patterns. There were circular, protruding parts on the sides of the hexagonal base. Each side had four circular protruding parts. On a closer look, every circular part was actually a formation array. This meant that there were twenty-four formation arrays on this hexagonal base.</span></p>

This metal ball was able to turn freely on the hexagonal base. The major axis of this ball was around two meters long, while its minor axis was around a meter and twenty centimeters long. There were complicated patterns carved on the entire ball, and whole thing actually looked like a huge, completed formation array.</span></p>

After this, he installed a total of twenty-four Class 6 Sealed Milk Bottles into the base.&nbsp;</span></p>

He muttered to himself, “A complete Class 8 soul tool! And it’s even close to a Class 9 soul tool. Furthermore, it’s used for auxiliary purposes. No matter what, I must bring this treasure back. Otherwise, Teacher Xuan will kill me. When little junior is back, we can adjust its position. We are at the north of the city, which is a very suitable location for this soul tool to be used. Hehe. Let me add a few other accessories, and let it ‘bloom’ when they come.”</span></p>
