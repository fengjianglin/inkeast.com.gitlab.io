 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it first appeared, the Dragon Emperor Douluo felt it the most acutely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power had left him astonished earlier, he was horrified to see the seven-colored dragon projection shining from Tang Wutong’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was just the color or aura of this projection, the Dragon Emperor Douluo wouldn’t have felt it so strongly. More importantly, it was the dominance of the projection that made him felt so overwhelmed. It was a dominance that originated from her lineage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dragon God?” Long Xiaoyao shouted, and subconsciously staggered back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, he and Mu En were called the Twin Holy Dragons of Black and White. Mu En’s title was the Dragon God, while he was the Dragon Emperor. However, such titles were only compliments to their immense abilities. Their martial souls were the Radiant Holy Dragon and Darkness Holy Dragon respectively, which were both branches of the dragon species. The reason why they were so strong was because they were one of the authentic dragons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Holy Dragon and Darkness Holy Dragon were both very respected, and were considered one of the more superior dragons. Long Xiaoyao’s martial soul was in fact of the same lineage as Di Tian. However, the difference between his martial soul and Di Tian’s was that Di Tian was the clan master of the Black Dragons, since he was the Golden-Eyed Black Dragon King. If the Darkness Holy Dragon actually existed, it would at most be regarded as an honorary elder of the Black Dragons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The aura that Tang Wutong exuded right now clearly belonged to that of dragons. However, it was far superior to the aura of the Radiant and Darkness Holy Dragons. Furthermore, the terrifying dominance from her aura only belonged to the original Dragon God!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the aura that came from Tang Wutong was slightly weaker, it was still different from that of the Darkness Holy Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her abilities weren’t enough to threaten Long Xiaoyao, but her streak of dragon aura completely suppressed Long Xiaoyao and his Darkness Holy Dragon, and fear rose inside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong had used the fourth soul skill of her Radiant Butterfly Goddess, Dragon God’s Possession!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven-colored dragon projection turned into a layer of thin seven-colored dragon scales on Tang Wutong’s body. Her dragon scales extended all the way to her lower jaw. Only her head wasn’t covered. After she was engulfed by the thin layer of dragon scales, her aura became more and more dominant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pair of wings also dyed in the same seven colors rose up behind her. Her second soul ring started to shine, a seven-colored light burning brightly. It was her second soul skill, Dragon God’s Fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A high-pitched dragon roar reverberated through the air, forming a huge seven-colored light blade that chopped towards Long Xiaoyao’s head. It was Tang Wutong’s third soul skill, Radiant Dragon God’s Slash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, even Long Xiaoyao couldn’t confirm what Tang Wutong’s martial soul was. However, there was one thing he was clear about: the blood lineage and aura of the Dragon God were present in her martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, he had thought that Huo Yuhao was the most special, far surpassing any generational talent. But right now, he immediately sensed that Tang Wutong was on the same tier as him when she unleashed her full strength! Even though he had been alive for more than two hundred years, he had never even heard of an inherited martial soul from the Dragon God before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lifted his right hand and gently slapped out. The night sky behind him instantly turned pitch-black.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Radiant Dragon God’s Slash was slowly dissipated by that darkness. However, Long Xiaoyao’s body actually shone with streaks of seven-colored light. Although they soon vanished, Tang Wutong’s attack was still able to hit him due to the Dragon God’s lineage in her attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s attacks didn’t cease just like that. She continued to charge forward, but her body transformed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The seven-colored dragon projection appeared once again. However, it was no longer illusory this time. It was well and truly real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a small and delicate seven-colored dragon. A pair of butterfly-shaped dragon wings opened behind her. Seven-colored scales reflected bright lights. This small seven-colored dragon was only seven meters long, very small and weak compared to a real dragon. Even most of the mature earthdragons were bigger than it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as soon as it appeared, Long Xiaoyao took another step back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By unleashing the Dragon’s God Possession through her Radiant Butterfly Goddess, it would naturally evolve into the Dragon God’s Descent. Of course it wasn’t the true Dragon God, but that streak of strength from the Dragon God’s lineage was still unleashed to its greatest potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Long Xiaoyao stepped back was because her Dragon God’s aura had become stronger again. If it were Ye Xishui, things would be different. But Long Xiaoyao’s Darkness Holy Dragon naturally developed some fear in front of the Dragon God’s aura. It was not something that could be made up for using his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s wings slashed down instantly. It was her Dragon Wings Guillotine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao lifted his right hand. Tang Wutong felt as if she had hit some kind of viscous fluid, which hindered her. It even felt as if she was stuck to something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another sonorous dragon roar sounded out. The seven-colored dragon roared furiously at Long Xiaoyao, and Tang Wutong’s fifth soul ring shone brightly. It was her fifth soul skill, Dragon God’s Roar!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A huge seven-colored dragon head appeared behind Tang Wutong. Following this roar, an intense seven-colored glow, nearly as large as Tang Wutong, was released in Long Xiaoyao’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black current around Long Xiaoyao was greatly dissipated by this seven-colored glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong unleashed her full strength, but why would Long Xiaoyao let her achieve what she wanted? He snorted coldly before the viscous black moved up to the seven-colored dragon wings. The incredible difference in their cultivations couldn’t be made up for just from the strength of Tang Wutong’s lineage. Tang Wutong only felt a wave of invisible, dark aura suppressing her spiritual power, keeping her Dragon God’s aura from spreading any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the surrounding temperature suddenly fell significantly. A snow-white figure appeared beside Tang Wutong and pressed her palm towards Long Xiaoyao’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The temperature didn’t actually fall. The chill came from within… within Long Xiaoyao’s body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Long Xiaoyao was stunned. He immediately flipped his left palm to receive the incoming palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Empress’ Sword, Empress’ Palm, Empress’ Chill! It was the Snow Empress and the Snowless Glacier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grrr!” the Snow Empress snorted gently, and her snowy-white figure turned illusory. A jade-green figure replaced her, and a sinister white light swept past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao pointed with his finger, and a sharp note rang out. The jade-green figure instantly turned illusory before it backed off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s left arm was quickly frozen from the consecutive strikes. A layer of frost engulfed his entire arm, and it turned completely numb. Even with his cultivation, he couldn’t instantly neutralize it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Destiny’s Demise had taken effect, and his material defense had been lowered. Otherwise, how could Long Xiaoyao be frozen, given that the Snow Empress and Ice Empress weren’t in their original forms?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this moment that a figure that exuded strong rose-gold light appeared. A palm also appeared with this figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Weird emotional undulations spread in the air. Sorrow, yearning, love, pain and all kinds of other emotions gathered in this palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Haodong Palm, a palm which lasted eternally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s right palm was controlling Tang Wutong, and his left palm was frozen. However, at this moment, he seemed very calm. He wasn’t as stunned as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He retracted his right hand and blocked Huo Yuhao’s palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When their palms collided, Huo Yuhao was instantly flung back. Long Xiaoyao’s body also jerked slightly, and he revealed a confused look in his eyes. At this instant, he seemed to have returned to two hundred years ago, when he was first making a name with Mu En and met Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">White and jade-green combined. Two hands were holding onto each other. The light projection re-formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like they had instantly arrived in another world. Everything around them instantly turned into a land of ice and snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress and Snow Empress disappeared. A rebuke that seemed to come from the icy plains of the Extreme North descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two giant beams of white and jade-green light instantly descended. The boundless darkness was crushed by that miraculous white and green, turning into powder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao shook. In the next moment, he had already turned into an ice statue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong struggled and managed to break free from her restraints. She flew back into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ice statue exploded, scattering ice everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Ice Explosion Technique. The ice formed from Ultimate Ice was immediately blown apart as the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao crashed to the ground and grabbed his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is it over?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just his Spirit Eyes that could unleash the strength of a Titled Douluo. When he used his full strength, he could do it with his Ultimate Ice martial soul, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Snow Empress recovered, the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses regained its full strength. The fusion of the Ice and Snow Empresses dropped the temperature of Ultimate Ice below negative two hundred and forty degrees Celsius. This terrifyingly low temperature instantly drained Huo Yuhao’s soul power. However, he still managed to complete this strike because both the Ice and Snow Empresses had absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, giving him a stable foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This could already compare to the all-out attack of a Titled Douluo. The Dragon Emperor Douluo was complacent. Along with Destiny’s Demise and Spiritual Dispossession, as well as the judgment of destiny, he was struck with the greatest misfortune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dragon Emperor Douluo disappeared. It looked like he had died from the Ice Explosion Technique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong had already retreated to Huo Yuhao’s side, and pulled him up. The two of them looked at each other, revealing puzzled looks in their eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Win? Did we win?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The answer was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Darkness, boundless, irresistible, and terrifying darkness, descended once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything stopped. Time, movement, and Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s blood and soul power slowed. At this moment, the two of them became statues. They stood there quietly, and only saw the dejected looks in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao slowly walked out from the darkness, just like he did when he first walked out from the Heavenly Soul Empire’s Imperial Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His white hair looked a little messy now. His clothes were also a little messy. However, this was the worst it got for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could an Ultimate Douluo be killed so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The two of you have indeed given me a lot of surprises. I didn’t expect young people to be so good nowadays. The new generation of youngsters has surpassed the older generations!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao didn’t feel down just because he was in a slightly pathetic state right now. On the contrary, he seemed to be very happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He gestured towards Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong. Huo Yuhao didn’t move, but Tang Wutong was directly drawn towards and landed in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong wasn’t able to move no matter how much she tried to circulate her soul power. She could only watch as she was brought over by Long Xiaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a beautiful young lady! If I were two hundred years younger, I might even chase you.” Long Xiaoyao’s expression turned cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The game is over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The darkness was removed, and Long Xiaoyao’s hand was on Tang Wutong’s shoulder. It was just a frail and elderly hand, but Tang Wutong felt as if everything in her body had been sealed. She couldn’t even muster her strength, and could only stand there just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao fell to the ground. All the fighting earlier had completely drained him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao said, “Huo Yuhao, do you know why I haven’t killed you yet? Given my abilities, I just need one strike to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed coldly. “I don’t think it’ll be so easy. You’re afraid that the Beast God will descend, aren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao laughed, “I said that I have many methods of making you unable to use Di Tian’s strength. Since you don’t really believe me, we can give it a go right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he waved his hand at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A streak of black light flashed and landed in front of Huo Yuhao. When Huo Yuhao lowered his head to look at it, he found out that a pitch-black dagger had landed by the side of his foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao pressed his hand on Tang Wutong’s shoulder, while his other hand held a dagger that was identical to the one beside Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can choose between stabbing yourself or letting me stab her. You have nine tries, and each stab has to be on your backbone. You can choose the exact position. You’ll stab once for every number I count. If you hesitate, she’ll take the stabs for you. After nine stabs, both of you can leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was stunned. He didn’t expect Long Xiaoyao to use such a method to threaten him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An Ultimate Douluo actually used a young lady to threaten him!</span></p>
