 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t trigger Ice Explosion, because now wasn’t a good time to do that. This soul tool front’s soul tools were very advanced, and destroying one would be a sizeable loss. Huo Yuhao didn’t know how the Dou Ling Empire’s royal palace was doing, but he would still attempt to reduce losses as much as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a step out and vanished into the soul tool front. He was two hundred meters away when he reappeared, next to an enormous soul tool inside the front.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone was just dashing out from this large soul tool right at this moment. He saw Huo Yuhao, and he was momentarily stunned before he raised his hand and fired a soul ray at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person was the soul tool front’s strongest individual, a Class 8 soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grunted coldly. He didn’t care about that class 8 soul ray, and a circle of blue light rippled on his Icy War God’s Armor before the soul ray’s destructiveness was completely dispelled. Huo Yuhao pushed out with his right hand, and dark golden light sliced across the sky like a rainbow as it immediately covered that Class 8 soul engineer’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden light glowed as an Invincible Barrier appeared. Class 8 soul engineers had many different ways to protect themselves, and this soul engineer was no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he couldn’t tell who Huo Yuhao was, his status in the Sun Moon Empire meant he had seen human-shaped soul tools before. The person before him was radiating an intimidating and magnificent aura, and was someone that he absolutely couldn’t fight against. He activated his Invincible Barrier, and then activated his soul thruster at his chest before his body bolted backward. He wanted to run.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a pity, because his Class 7 Invincible Barrier that he had always been proud of dropped to the ground in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Invincible Barrier’s defenses were excellent, but a tremendous force still smashed it heavily to the ground. Five shocking cracks appeared on the barrier’s surface, like it could shatter at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five chilly waves coursed in from those cracks, and the Class 8 soul engineer hurriedly activated another protective soul barrier. Unfortunately, Huo Yuhao wouldn’t give him another chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao tapped his foot on the ground and appeared in front of that Invincible Barrier. He pressed his left hand simply on the barrier’s surface before he turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden barrier immediately turned icy blue, and the person holding the Invincible Barrier had become completely motionless. He had become a statue of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Empress’ Palm, Snowless Glacier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not even an Invincible Barrier could block Snowless Glacier’s extreme chills. Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice was at an unrivaled standard after obtaining his second soul core, and his Empress’ Palm resembled the Snow Empress’ glory during her strongest days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection covered the entire soul tool front, and he didn’t discover any other living people. He swiftly reached the main control platform and withdrew his Ultimate Ice’s chill at the same time. Huo Yuhao opened the soul protective barrier and allowed his companions to enter from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Third senior brother, you guys will remain here and guard this soul tool front. Activate the linked defensive barrier and wait for my return. You’re coming with me, Wutong. We’ll take a look at Dou Ling City. The Sun Moon Empire has deployed two soul engineer legions to ambush the city, and I’m afraid they’re already in a dire situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grabbed Tang Wutong’s hand as he quickly finished his speech and soared into the sky towards Dou Ling City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was the first person to feel something different as they held hands. She realized to her surprise that her soul power couldn’t fuse with Huo Yuhao’s soul power like before to form Haodong power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s soul power seemed to become solid, and didn’t allow her soul power to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao controlled his flight toward Dou Ling City as he explained his soul power’s current situation to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong frowned. “That means I have to obtain my Yin Yang Complement soul core before I can use Haodong power with you again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head. “I don’t know. I’m the first human to possess a second soul core through the Yin Yang Complement method, after all. We can slowly try in the future to see if you can adjust so that our martial souls can fuse again. I think we can still use our martial soul fusion skills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Now clearly wasn’t the time to discuss this question, as they arrived above Ling Dou City as they spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were fires everywhere inside the city, especially toward the city’s central areas. Flames burned into the sky as dense smoke covered everything, and nothing could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart sank. Even though he couldn’t see, he could still sense with his Spiritual Detection! There was an enormous crater that was more than three hundred meters in diameter, and it was almost fifty meters deep. All the structures around that crater had been reduced to rubble and dust, and judging from the buildings around it, that area was likely to have been Dou Ling City’s royal palace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire is so cruel. The Evil Tyrant and Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legions are so cruel. Since they are so cruel, don’t blame me for not being nice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power erupted. His Spiritual Detection had been covering the city when he was breaking through that soul tool front, and all of the soul engineer legions’ members were within his detection range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul engineers still didn’t know that their soul tool front at the back had been breached, and they were still wreaking havoc within Dou Ling City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dou Ling City’s surviving forces were almost completely wiped out. The thing that had bombarded the royal palace was undoubtedly a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell, and those two soul engineer legions were currently assaulting the city without any restraint. They were particularly searching for soul masters and soul engineers to attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they weren’t careless, even though they were very outrageous. The soul engineers formed groups of ten and moved together, and anybody who had the guts to resist were attacked with their full strength at once and killed. The soul engineer legions were also attacking several large buildings to destroy them and cause chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dou Ling City’s city defense army wasn’t small, but there were very few who were considered formidable. The Dou Ling Empire’s elite soul masters had all travelled toward Shrek City, while most of their powerful individuals had been inside the royal palace, which had been blown up, and the city had sustained heavy losses. How could they gather to fight against two soul engineer legions at a time like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like the Imperial Dragon and Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legions had been holding back for quite some time. They had had to search for the blind spots in the Dou Ling Empire’s surveillance, and infiltrate the empire’s territory. They didn’t dare to cross any large cities, so they had to proceed through the wilderness and suburbs. They used their surveillance soul tools to scout ahead bit by bit, and it was a long and hard journey to reach Dou Ling City. Today was the day that they had decided to launch an offensive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao had been later by another two hours, these two soul engineer legions would probably have already disappeared after their feat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao stretched out his spiritual power as he pulled Tang Wutong and disappeared into the smoke. He was using Imitation, and he wasn’t afraid of being discovered at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A team of soul engineers swiftly crossed in front of them, and Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong followed them on a whim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul engineers belonged to the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion. This legion was the fastest among the four beast-ranked legions, and Huo Yuhao hated them the most, because they had been the ones who had surrounded and attacked him and Wang Qiu’er. Wang Qiu’er probably wouldn’t have had to sacrifice herself if not for this legion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was eager because of his hatred and resentment. He didn’t wait for long before he waved his right hand, and a giant Darkgolden Terrorclaw a hundred meters long cut across the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul engineers didn’t react at all before the large claw slashed through them. They all had at least four soul rings, and were all equipped with automatic defensive soul tools. However, their cultivations were too low. How could these four-ringed and five-ringed soul engineers do anything against a Titled Douluo without linked soul tools?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The smoke became Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s best cover. Ten soul engineers perished from a single successful strike, and Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong started searching for the next group of soul engineers along the periphery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two beast-ranked legions’ soul engineers were still formidable. If they could gather and unleash their linked offensive soul tools, Huo Yuhao would still have to tuck tail and run, even with his current cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they were too arrogant. They had already taken down Dou Ling City, and they had already worked together to take out almost all of their strongest individuals. Seven Titled Douluo had perished under their linked offensive soul tools, and only then did they disperse to sweep the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These soul engineers had storage-type soul tools, and this was the Dou Ling Empire’s capital city. How could they not pillage?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Greed was a sin, and it was because of greed that they didn’t know that they had become the hunted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was all too effective at a time like this. He didn’t touch the soul engineers who had more than seven soul rings, but he specifically went for relatively weaker soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao wanted to kill them with one hit, so he didn’t give his opponents any chance to notify their companions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong didn’t do anything from the beginning to the end, whether Huo Yuhao used his Darkgolden Terrorclaws or Spiritual Blast.</span></p>
