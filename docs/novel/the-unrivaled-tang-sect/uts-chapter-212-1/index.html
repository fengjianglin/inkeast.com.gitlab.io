It was only when Bei Bei disappeared that he muttered to himself, “On account of Tang Ya, I won’t hold it against you.”</span></p>

He said softly, “Brother, you’re more experienced than me even though you’ve lost every fight that you’ve been in! Teach me a few tricks, please!”</span></p>

To He Caitou and Huo Yuhao, this Sea God's Fate was very new and interesting. However, they weren’t really nervous. After all, they were experienced. After their experiences in the Elite Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament, their ability to deal with psychological pressure had grown tremendously. In addition, they also had the training from the Ultimate Soldier Plan. Although they weren’t completely immune, they wouldn’t become anxious easily.</span></p>

Perhaps it was because of the Sea God's Fate, but Sea God’s Island revealed an enchanting aura.</span></p>

They demonstrated their abilities and quickly gathered by the lakeside.</span></p>

As the pitch-black mist above the lake spread, it was difficult to see anything clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, a huge boat came toward the island from the distance. The boat was all lit up, and the inner courtyard students could see that it was the largest ferry on Sea God’s Lake. Right now, it was filled with people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had great eyesight, and could clearly see who was on the ferry. He saw several elders from the Sea God’s Pavilion: Yan Shaozhe, Cai Mei’er, Xian Lin’er, Qian Duoduo, and Fan Yu, along with a couple that he wasn’t familiar with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who had previously participated in the Sea God's Fate knew what was going on. Those who were experiencing this for the first time were filled with expectation.</span></p>

Holding such an activity meant that the young men were being given an opportunity to show off, and potentially earn themselves a date.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ferry stopped in the middle of the lake. At this point, a ray of light shot out from the lake, which then separated into seventeen individual rays.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wow…” The male students were all in awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The seventeen rays of light were dim gold, and on top each of them was a young lady in a white dress. All seventeen white dresses were the same. They also wore the same bamboo hats on their heads, and their faces were covered by identical white veils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They looked like fairies under the illumination of the golden light. Their appearance was dazzling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were all quietly lined up in a row, facing the shore. The male students were all very eager by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, two stronger rays of light also appeared, and two figures surfaced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the left was Bei Bei, who was wearing a long white robe. On the right was the Shrek Academy inner courtyard’s eldest senior sister, Zhang Lexuan, who was decked out in a light yellow dress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After not seeing her for two years, Huo Yuhao discovered that she hadn’t changed at all. Time hadn’t seemed to leave a mark on her body, she was still as sweet and beautiful as before, with a light smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bei Bei’s voice resonated. “Sea God’s Fate above Sea God’s Lake! One day to pick your love! Welcome all to the lakeside of Sea God’s Lake on this beautiful night! The annual Sea God's Fate will be starting soon! As the emcee of today’s prestigious event, I’ll like to wish all inner courtyard students good luck in finding your partner on behalf of myself and eldest senior sister. At the same time, I’d like to welcome the elders from the Sea God’s Pavilion and the teachers who are observing today’s event! On behalf of the students, I’d like to sincerely thank all of you. Without your patience in nurturing and helping us, we wouldn’t have achieved what we have today!” After he finished speaking, he placed his right hand on his chest and turned to the ferry before bowing in an expression of gratitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan smiled and nodded at Bei Bei, signaling to him that he could continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a simple opening speech, but it generated rapturous applause. The male students were also cheering loudly. Those who already had a partner in mind were even more eager.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All you young men, please make your preparations. There will be thirty-nine beams of light appearing from the lake later. Those who are closest to our Sea God’s Fairies will be first to participate in the first segment, while the students at the back might not be able to obtain suitable rankings in the first segment. That’s why it’s important to be alert. No matter what method you use, you must find a spot on the water lilies illuminated by the beams of light. However, you must not land in the water. Those who do will be disqualified.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His explanation was very clear. Most of the young men were already raring to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao seemed to sense something. As he turned, he saw Dai Huabin throwing a look at him. Dai Huabin’s gaze was cold and fierce. Huo Yuhao smiled; he wasn’t bothered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone be prepared. Three, two, one.” On the other side, Bei Bei was already counting down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Begin!”</span></p>

These thirty-nine beams of light formed three neat rows, each row five meters away from the next. They were spread out proportionately on the lake surface a hundred meters away from the female students, and around two hundred meters away from the shore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Bei Bei shouted, everyone on the shore started to act.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those who had an obvious advantage were the soul masters with flying-type martial souls. Fortunately, only four out of the thirty-nine male students unleashed their martial souls. They flew into the air and rushed swiftly towards the center of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their soul rings shone brightly, and were very clear above the lake under the night sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lifted his head to watch, and was in awe. They were indeed seniors from the inner courtyard. Out of the four, two of them were seven-ringed Soul Sages, and had two yellow, two purple and three black soul rings – the best combination of soul rings that could normally be achieved. The other two had six rings, and their six rings were also the optimal combination of colors. As the four of them charged forward, they turned into four streaks of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest of the students also showed off their moves. The shore started to shine brightly with soul rings. It was like a huge batch of fireworks had been released!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao, He Caitou, and Xu Sanshi were naturally unwilling to lag behind. Huo Yuhao and He Caitou acted at the same time. The two of them lifted off the ground, and their soul thrusters were activated. The strong thrusting force propelled them forward fast enough to surpass their seniors, even though they had lower cultivations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The explosive speed of their soul thrusters was great, but they couldn’t last long. Otherwise, their soul power would be greatly depleted, and the soul thrusters wouldn’t be able to take it, either. It was possible to travel two hundred meters in the air, but not on the ground. On the one hand, the depletion was too great. On the other hand, there wasn’t sufficient space, and it was difficult to control their movements at that speed.</span></p>

Although their martial souls couldn’t fly, there wasn’t much difference from using their flying-type soul tools instead. They zipped straight towards the center of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they were using external forces to help them fly, and needed some time to pour in their soul power and control their soul tools. Although they were very quick, they didn’t end up in advantageous spots compared to the other inner courtyard students, who had unleashed all sorts of moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Huo Yuhao and He Caitou were closing in on the thirty-nine streaks of light, someone had already landed on a water lily in the first row.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water lilies were very obvious on the lake surface. The lilies looked fresh and invigorating under the illumination of the strong lights below them. They were azure-green, like jade floating on the water’s surface. They appeared very enchanting floating in the background of the surrounding white lights.</span></p>
