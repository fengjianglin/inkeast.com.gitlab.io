 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

However, igniting one’s spiritual power was definitely uncontrollable, and both the body and spirit of a person would be completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this guy crazy? Did we even say we were going to kill him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yu didn’t know that Huo Yuhao had made such an unhesitant and determined decision mainly for two reasons. First, he felt that he owed Wang Qiu’er too much. She was here to rescue him in this time of crisis, and he felt that he was obligated to ensure that she was safe. In order to send Wang Qiu’er away safely, he needed sufficient strength. Secondly, he felt that Wu Yu was too threatening. Huo Yuhao was reminded of how Feng Ling was turned into a madam, and he was afraid to end up like him. He would rather his body and spirit be destroyed than to become a second Feng Ling. That was also the more important reason why he was willing to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stepped out with his left leg, and his bright eyes turned gentler. A golden projection silently appeared behind him. Compared to Wang Qiu’er, this projection seemed a little more slender, and had straight hair. Wasn’t this Wang Dong’er? She quietly flew forward and adopted a hugging posture before she stuck close and fused with Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this process, she also flew past Wang Qiu’er’s body. Wang Qiu’er shuddered, and a look of sadness flashed across her beautiful eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even at this life-and-death moment,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">he still only has her in his heart!</span></p>

At this moment, to him, his enemies didn’t seem to exist anymore. There was only a look of remembrance in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remembrance was a magical thing. Huo Yuhao unleashed his Fist of Remembrance, which contained a surging feeling of remembrance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fist with an indescribable color, but which yet seemed to shine with a special glow, was formed. Huo Yuhao didn’t seem to have a target, and he just unleashed his fist into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, all three of the evil soul masters, which comprised two Titled Douluo and one Soul Douluo, felt as if Huo Yuhao’s fist was unleashed towards them. An indescribable emotion instantly spread in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Elder was the first to bear the brunt of Huo Yuhao’s attack, as he was standing directly opposite Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He straightened his Netherworld Sword, and his seventh soul ring shone. His body instantly turned into a streak of black light, and he fused with his sword. Following this, another tragic scream sounded. Among the nine netherworld souls in the Fourth Elder’s Netherworld Sword, the second soul was crushed, and the earlier purplish sword projection surfaced again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space shook like the strings of a violin, and the Fourth Elder’s Martial Soul True Body, which was this purplish Netherworld Sword, surged up. However, it was forced back into the original form of the Fourth Elder’s sword and disappeared. In addition, the soul engineers from the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion in the air who had already retreated quite some distance also seemed to be infected by something. They started to tear up, and they couldn’t control their emotions. They even couldn’t control themselves in the air, and their soul tools started to fall from their hands. At this point, metal was raining down inside the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all of these soul engineers were all remembering their loved ones, and they lost their fighting spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the highest level of profundity of the Fist of Remembrance. There wasn’t any outright force, but it influenced, controlled and even destroyed one’s emotions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The stronger one’s spiritual power was, the greater the influence on their emotions. This was especially applicable for those who shared a similar type of remembrance with Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder had already raised his right arm, and was prepared to use a strong soul tool to destroy Huo Yuhao. However, it stopped in the air. He turned his gaze towards Nan Shuishui, who was right beside him. Remembrance was a magical thing. Right now, the person he yearned for the most was beside him. A blissful smile unwittingly appeared on his face. At this moment, he had already completely forgotten what he was doing here, and that he was supposed to attack Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yu was dealt a larger blow than the Third Elder. She and Wu Yun were twin sisters, and they suffered from similar circumstances. When Wu Yun’s emotions changed, she would experience similar emotional changes, too. After she saw what Huo Yuhao presented to her through his Imitation, her emotions were fluctuating even worse than her elder sister. Right now, all types of complex emotions erupted in her head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yun had been able to instinctively counter-attack and defend herself. However, Wu Yu was completely motionless in the air, and in a daze as she stared at Huo Yuhao. All sorts of emotions were surging and changing continuously in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Compared to her, the Fourth Elder was under less influence. However, he was directly in front of Huo Yuhao’s Fist of Remembrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This fist was a perfect combination of spiritual and soul power, and it was infused with the feeling of remembrance. When it was unleashed, it was completely imprinted onto the Fourth Elder’s Martial Soul True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sword intent of his purple sword was suppressed, and his sword was flung back amidst a piercing buzzing sound. He flew back several hundred meters before he managed to stabilize himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t stop. When he unleashed his Fist of Remembrance, he had already forgotten everything about the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The identical projection above him started to burn more brightly. It was the origin power in his spiritual sea that was burning! Otherwise, how could he possibly unleash such strong emotions and infect the two Titled Douluo until they weren’t able to hold their ground anymore?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao exerted force with his left foot and he was lifted higher again. He lifted his right hand and pointed his index and middle fingers upward. A lustrous, bright glow instantly shot into the sky. A huge beam of sword light around a hundred meters long and several dozen meters wide shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bright sword light seemed to pierce the sky. Wherever it passed, space distorted and would gently shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression also started to change. The gentle look in his eyes turned into pain, and he pursed his lips tightly. His eyes had already turned wet, and his emotions seemed to completely enter another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Remembrance... it started from thinking before it escalated to missing. Wang Dong’er’s face flashed in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. He suddenly felt that he was very blissful. Even if he had to die, he was able to die during his remembrance of Wang Dong’er. He was satisfied. This was probably the best result, considering the situation he was in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The majestic sword light descended from the sky. One’s swordplay could only reach the peak if he handled his relationships well. This was Huo Yuhao’s Sword of Longing, a sword which would never be forgotten!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a target for this sword… Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for the fact that Wu Yu had controlled Feng Ling, Huo Yuhao’s almost perfect plan wouldn’t have experienced such a huge problem. More importantly, Wu Yu’s emotions were completely controlled by his Fist of Remembrance right now. This was his best breakthrough point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was affected worse than the rest because she was a spiritual-type soul master. Her Spirit of Vengeance relied on boundless hatred. However, she was forced to experience the feeling of remembrance by Huo Yuhao at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could she avoid his Sword of Longing now, after being affected by his Fist of Remembrance earlier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her Spirit of Vengeance sensed a huge crisis, and unleashed itself from her body to protect her. Wu Yu seemed to be getting a slow grip on her emotions, but it was all too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s fusion with Wang Qiu’er and his ignition of his spiritual sea had raised his strength to a standard above Wu Yu. The Three Ultimate Haodong Skills had finally revealed the terrifying strength that they were meant to possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why didn’t Huo Yuhao use the abilities that the Snow Empress, the Ice Empress and the Skydream Iceworm had conferred on him? It was because he had to continue to be connected to them if he used their abilities. If that happened, they wouldn’t be able to separate from him after his death and fuse with Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was why Huo Yuhao could only use the three skills that he had invented, the Three Ultimate Haodong Skills!</span></p>

Wherever this sword light passed, spots of bright light were left behind in the air. It was as if tears of remembrance had been scattered in the air.</span></p>

She drifted several meters back before stopping. The bloodshot look in her eyes faded away, and her gaze started to become similar to Huo Yuhao’s.</span></p>

Against Huo Yuhao’s complete version of the Three Ultimate Haodong Skills, she didn’t manage to survive until his last skill. She was already sucked into the whirlpool of remembrance by the Sword of Longing.</span></p>

She was reunited with her elder sister in another world.</span></p>

There’s a fight in Sunrise City. It could be a fight involving Titled Douluo, considering how strong the spiritual undulations are. Quick, let’s return!” Ma Xiaotao was frantic. After giving out her order, she immediately leapt up, and her wings fluttered forcefully as she quickly proceeded back toward Sunrise City.</span></p>

However, she kept on telling herself that it was probably because Huo Yuhao was about to be caught. She had also been thinking of a plan of action if Huo Yuhao was caught. Without the Third and Fourth Elders, it was possible for Huo Yuhao and the others to kill the Zhong brothers if they coordinated well. It was just that the Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion was nearby, and their leader, who was a Class 9 soul engineer, was very difficult to deal with.</span></p>

The reason why she was feeling uneasy wasn’t because it originated from a distance, but because it came from behind her!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Don’t tell me that little brother didn’t leave Sunrise City, and he’s still inside?</span></p>
