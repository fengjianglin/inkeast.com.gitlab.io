 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p> 
 <p> <a href="/announcement/hiring-two-paid-front-end-technomancer-interns">Read More...</a> </p> 
</div>
<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Teacher Xiao Ya is indeed in the base.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes brightened, and he turned to Bei Bei. Bei Bei already looked pretty agitated right now. He finally knew where she was, and had an opportunity to save her. Bei Bei was overwhelmed with emotion, and subconsciously clenched his fists.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe nodded and said, “I’ll let you retain your soul power, seeing that you are so cooperative.” As he spoke, he retracted the whirlpool above Nangong Wan and slapped his forehead with his right hand, knocking Nangong Wan unconscious once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire room descended into momentary silence. They had obtained valuable information after capturing Nangong Wan. Not only did they find out where Tang Ya and Ma Xiaotao were, they also understood more about the internal structure of the Holy Ghost Church. This was very helpful to Shrek Academy for dealing with the Holy Ghost Church in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked at Yan Shaozhe and asked, “Dean Yan, since we have accurate information, can we plan how we’re going to carry out our operation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was amused as he looked at him and said, “Didn’t we agree that you’d command the operation? Of course you’ll come up with the plan. What ideas do you have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao couldn’t be bothered with being modest right now and immediately replied, “If we want to save Teacher Xiao Ya, we can only bait her out. The Sun Moon Empire’s set-up is too strong. Five soul formations are enough to kill any expert. We need to draw Teacher Xiao Ya out, no other way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe squinted and asked, “How do we do that then? Unless it’s a full-scale battle, the Holy Ghost Church’s sect leader might not appear. Tang Ya will naturally not appear then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow and said, “Yes, that’s why it’s difficult. If we fight all-out, the Heavenly Soul Empire will suffer heavy losses. Even if the Sun Moon Empire wouldn’t have sufficient resources to last the entire fight, they’ll still be very strong once they attack. They still have a lot of evil soul masters helping them. That’s why I believe that the Heavenly Soul Empire won’t be willing to cooperate with us if that were the plan. If that’s the case, we only have one other solution.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Elder Song, Yan Shaozhe and Bei Bei focused their attention on Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes flashed with a cold light and he turned to Nangong Wan before saying, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No!” Bei Bei shouted without any hesitation. His eyes were filled with horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao only said a few words, Bei Bei knew exactly what he wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can’t do it. It’s too dangerous.” Elder Song commented. “You want to use him to enter the base? Have you even thought of what would happen if you were recognized? There are many powerful individuals in the Sun Moon Empire’s base. The Holy Ghost Church’s sect leader is even holding down the fort. How can you sneak in so easily?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and replied, “Elder Song, Dean Yan, eldest senior, don’t worry. Since I came up with his idea, I’m naturally confident that it’ll work. Although there’s some risk, it’s not as bad as all of you think. Elder Song, take a look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao spun once. Suddenly, his aura changed greatly, and his body rapidly transformed. After he completed his turn, his look had completely changed. Didn’t he look just like the Masquerade Douluo? Even his aura was identical, sinister and cold. There were no discrepancies at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Earlier, Elder Song and Huo Yuhao had faced the two evil Titled Douluo together. Right now, she was astonished when she saw the changes to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song was a Rank 97 Titled Douluo. However, she couldn’t tell that there was anything wrong with Huo Yuhao just by using her normal senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song increased her spiritual power and swept it across Huo Yuhao. He shuddered slightly, but a wave of spiritual power was suddenly deflected back. It even carried a sinister aura. Just like before, there wasn’t any difference from the Masquerade Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lifted his hands, and pitch-black maggots started to surface in mid-air. Every maggot carried strong spiritual undulations. They reached toward Elder Song like a huge web.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Elder Song felt something wrong when she came into contact with this huge web. Earlier, the soul skill that the Masquerade Douluo had unleashed caused her entire person, including her spirit, to slow slightly. However, Huo Yuhao’s soul skill only left her slightly weaker. There was a difference when it came to strength, but the sinister aura remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Song said, “Your soul skill seems to be off, but it appears very similar on the surface.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “It definitely won’t be the same. However, with my Imitation and Nangong Wan’s help, there shouldn’t be too many problems. Nangong Wan holds an even higher position than the Masquerade Douluo. I’ll ask him about some of the Masquerade Douluo’s habits later. After we return, I won’t be easy to recognize with Nangong Wan leading the way. Even the sect leader can’t tell who I am without laying his hands on me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei shook his head and said, “No, it’s too dangerous. I can’t implicate you to save Xiao Ya. Little junior, I know that you want to save her, too. If not for the fact that I’m helpless, I would have volunteered to sneak in instead. However, you’re different. You’re the future hope of the Tang Sect and Shrek Academy. I can’t have you take this risk. If something happens to you, how could I account to the Academy and the rest of our teammates?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said, “Eldest senior, we have no other way right now. We can only do this so that we can achieve our aim in the shortest time possible. Furthermore, who says that I’m going alone? All of you will follow me. I can’t fight by myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Bei Bei, Elder Song and Yan Shaozhe were stunned as they looked at Huo Yuhao.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is he not going alone?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were so many of them, and none of them had Imitation like Huo Yuhao. How could they sneak in too?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled mysteriously and said, “Let’s make a simple plan and take advantage of the time that we have to sneak into the Sun Moon Empire’s base first. After that, we can discuss our detailed plan. We…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lowered his voice and explained the plan once. After hearing his plan, Bei Bei looked enlightened, while Elder Song and Yan Shaozhe were increasingly shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">--------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One hour later...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The night sky was still dark, but the Sun Moon Empire’s base wasn’t peaceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect leader of the Holy Ghost Church was standing in the center of the commander’s tent of the Sun Moon Empire’s Crusading Army. The marshal of this army was a very notable general in the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi had returned to the empire, and had other plans. The army was now commanded by this marshal. Although he was already more than seventy years old, he was still a Soul Douluo, called Lin Hai. Although his cultivation wasn’t superb, his influence in the Sun Moon Empire was still great, as he hailed from a family of military men, and he was also a Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Initially, when Ju Zi had entered the army, he had helped her a lot. He was also of the same lineage as Xu Tianran. Otherwise, Xu Tianran wouldn’t have passed him the reins of the three armies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Hai had another advantage that enabled him to become marshal of the three armies. It was his abilities. Weak abilities weren’t always necessarily a bad thing. Because he wasn’t a Titled Douluo, he couldn’t command the stronger Class 9 soul engineer legion, even though his influence in the army was very high. Thus he could only command the ordinary soldiers. While the legion commanders of the soul engineer legions had to listen to his instructions, they still acted with great autonomy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi could truly ensure strict obedience to her instructions and command the entire army. It wasn’t because of her soulmaster abilities, but her mysterious and unpredictable strategies that left the three armies shocked. Right now, Ju Zi was being called the ‘Female God of War’ in the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Hai didn’t possess the same unpredictability as Ju Zi, but he was more sturdy as a person. What was needed now was balance. He was naturally the most suitable person to command the three armies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Hai wasn’t in a good mood. Yesterday, their ground-based surveillance soul tools had discovered enemies sneaking about in the sky. They fired a linked attack, but couldn’t lock onto the foe because they were too far away. He didn’t know what had happened. However, he gave the order to increase their surveillance of the sky after that incident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, the enemies appeared again today. Just as Lin Hai was about to attack the sky with even greater intensity, the sect leader of the Holy Ghost Church wanted people to capture their enemies alive. After all, enemies that could conceal themselves were very difficult to take precautions against. It was better to capture them and find out where their abilities came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sect leader of the Holy Ghost Church was also the Imperial Tutor. At the same time, he had the authority to supervise Lin Hai. Lin Hai naturally couldn’t stop him, given that he had made such a proposition. As a result, the Heavenly Centipede Douluo and Masquerade Douluo were deployed. To Zhongli Wu, two evil Titled Douluo were enough to capture their enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, who could guess that Nangong Wan and the Masquerade Douluo would disappear? Even the ground-based surveillance soul tools only discovered strong soul power undulations before the two of them vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were two evil Titled Douluo. The Holy Ghost Church had been around for many years, but there weren’t many evil Titled Douluo. Zhongli Wu held Nangong Wan in high regard. Although he wasn’t young anymore, his Heavenly Centipede could still improve. If he was lucky enough, he might still become a Transcendent Douluo.
