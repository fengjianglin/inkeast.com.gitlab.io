 <p><strong>Book 5: The Championship Fight</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 32.1: Rewards and the Core Disciples</strong></p>
 <p>However, Du Weilun naturally had enormous mental fortitude as the Director of Studies for the outer courtyard. After feeling depressed for a brief moment, he quickly regained his composure and exposed a somewhat helpless smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“I have to say, you were all extremely outstanding. I’ve lost face because I underestimated the strength of your fusion skills. I can’t blame anyone else for this fault of mine. I won’t even charge a fee for allowing all of you to see my back today.”</p>
 <p>Once he spoke, laughter immediately rang out from the tall stage. One definitely had to admit that Du Weilun was extremely charismatic. With just a simple sentence, he’d already gotten rid of his embarrassment. In addition to his self-derision, the teachers above were even praising him inwardly. If it were them in this sort of situation, could they be as calm and collected as Du Weilun was?</p>
 <p>Du Weilun continued, “I know, there will be doubts in everyone’s hearts if I don’t explain everything clearly. First of all, I need to reaffirm my previous words. I made no mistake; the final champions are Wang Dong, Xiao Xiao, and Huo Yuhao. They’ve performed spectacularly to obtain the final victory in this year’s freshmen assessment, and they are entirely worthy of their positions as champions.”</p>
 <p>He repeated his previous announcement, causing the expressions of Dai Huabin’s trio to become even uglier.</p>
 <p>Du Weilun continued, “Everyone saw what just happened. As a teacher, I must do all I can to prevent the death of outstanding freshmen. Both sides were using fusion skills, so it was impossible for even the two Deans to determine the victor of this match via eyesight alone. Thus, I had no choice but to receive both attacks with my body. I know, I was injured by Dai Huabin and Zhu Lu’s Netherworld White Tiger, so they should’ve obtained the win. However, I ask all of you: As a Soul Douluo, is my defense really that weak? They were using a fusion skill, but it was still a fusion between a Soul Elder and Soul Grandmaster. If they were actually able to directly wound me, even when I’d used my soul power to protect myself, then I might as well resign from my position of Director.”</p>
 <p>The anger and discontent in Dai Huabin’s eyes gradually vanished as he listened to Du Weilun’s words. Right! As an eight-ringed Soul Douluo, how could their fusion skill actually injure him? That was truly somewhat inconceivable.</p>
 <p>Du Weilun continued, “With this, everyone should’ve guessed the answer to this question. The reason why the Netherworld White Tiger was able to injure me was because I’d taken on another fusion skill. Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao, I still don’t know the name of your fusion skill. As a person who personally took on your fusion skill, don’t I have the qualifications to know what it’s name is?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong laughed softly. “Teacher Du, you’re the first person to receive our fusion skill. This is also the first time we’ve used it in an actual battle after testing it out.”</p>
 <p>Du Weilun was somewhat astonished as he looked at him. “I’m extremely honoured to have been the first to receive it. Then, can I know its name?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong nodded. “Of course. Yuhao, you tell him.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao gazed towards the distant Dai Huabin, then spoke slowly with a calm voice, “Our fusion skill is called ‘The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence.’”</p>
 <p>Du Weilun cast his gaze downwards, and a trace of shock flashed through his eyes. A 30-meter long, half-meter deep gorge had appeared in the ground of the Assessment Arena, which flickered with a dazzling golden luster that couldn’t be concealed beneath the sun’s rays.</p>
 <p>Previously, the teachers atop the tall stage had only been paying attention to the outcome of the battle. Thus, they only noticed the dazzling golden road after Huo Yuhao mentioned it. The golden trail stretched all the way to where Du Weilun was standing.</p>
 <p>Du Weilun nodded slightly. “I have to admit, your fusion skill is one of the most peculiar ones I’ve ever seen. The fact that you two were able to release this much power with your current cultivation ranks has already exceeded the range of my research towards fusion skills. I believe that your compatibility rate is definitely extremely high.”</p>
 <p>With that, he turned back towards Dai Huabin’s trio. “There’s only one reason why your Netherworld White Tiger was able to injure me. Before your attack reached me, I was struck by their Golden Road. Only after that did your attack arrive. The effect of a fusion skill is a soul master’s secret, so that’s all I can say about their attack. The other two Deans were also there just now, and I believe that they were able to tell whose skill was superior from the fluctuations in my soul power the instant I was struck.”</p>
 <p>“Your Netherworld White Tiger is extremely strong. In a situation like that, you undoubtedly would’ve won if you were able to dodge their Golden Road. However, you were stunned after being hit by Xiao Xiao’s soul skill. In other words, you would’ve been unable to dodge it. Under those circumstances, you would’ve definitely lost after taking their Golden Road head-on. Alright, that’s all I can say. The freshmen assessment has ended. The freshmen meeting will occur tomorrow afternoon, and the top three teams will receive their prizes while we divide you all into your classes for your first year.”</p>
 <p>“If you win, don’t be arrogant; if you lose, don’t be discouraged. This is a necessity if you want to improve. You’re all a part of the most outstanding students I’ve seen in this year’s freshmen; I don’t wish for this match to affect your future growth. Alright, let’s end it here.”</p>
 <p>With that, Du Weilun turned away and hurriedly left the Assessment Area.</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin’s body swayed slightly. He was only able to avoid falling down with Zhu Lu’s help. The obstinance and arrogance that had once filled his face had been swept away, with disbelief and an intense unwillingness taking its place.</p>
 <p><em>I lost, I actually lost. I lost to two opponents who had cultivations far below mine. How is this possible? How could this be possible?</em></p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s eyesight was exceedingly good, which allowed him to clearly see the changes in Dai Huabin’s expression. A hard-to-describe feeling of elation rose in his heart, and he suddenly discovered that beating Dai Huabin at his most conceited state seemed to be a very good way of obtaining revenge.</p>
 <p>“We won!”</p>
 <p>“We’re the champions!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Xiao and Wang Dong’s exuberant cheers rang out, and the two of them grabbed ahold of Huo Yuhao and flung him into the air.</p>
 <p>Three people, one team. They had finally become the champions of the freshmen assessment. But, who was the true nucleus of their team? Xiao Xiao and Wang Dong were fully aware of who it was.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao’s powerful strength had been completely displayed during their many matches, attracting the attention of all of the teachers. However, were it not for Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection and Spiritual Shock, as well as his grasp of the battlefield and his movements at the vital points of their battles, and were it not for Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s fusion skill, how could they have reached their current position?</p>
