 <p><strong>Book 10: Shrek's Seven Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 65.1: Mix'n'Match Battle of the Seven Monsters!</strong></p>
 <p>Dai Yaoheng glanced at Ma Xiaotao, feeling a little dubious. In a low voice, he said, “Chen Zifeng, Xu Sanshi.”</p>
 <p>Both of them immediately arrived at Dai Yaoheng’s side.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao immediately made her decision again, “Xi Xi, Bei Bei.”</p>
 <p>Hearing her say this, Huo Yuhao almost burst out laughing. Combining the characters from “Xi” and “Bei”, wouldn’t that form the word for fake goods?</p>
 <p>As he was walking over, Bei Bei evidently thought of that as well, because the expression on his face was a little strange. He wanted to laugh, but he held it in.</p>
 <p>Dai Yaoheng said, “Ling Luochen, Yao Haoxuan.” He could choose three people for the starting lineup. After Ma Xiaotao made two of her selections, it was naturally important to decide the next two candidates at the first possible moment. The team would definitely be a little stronger with a Soul King amongst them, especially since their opponents were all inner courtyard students from Shrek Academy.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao naturally went ahead and chose two more people. This time around, she obviously chose the reserve members from the outer courtyard, “He Caitou, Wang Dong.”</p>
 <p>Both parties had finished making their decisions at this moment in time. In the end, Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao naturally went to Dai Yueheng’s team, since they were the only two remaining from the reserve team. On Ma Xiaotao’s end, the ones she chose were herself, Gong Yangmo, Huo Yuhao, Xi Xi, Bei Bei, He Caitou and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Dai Yueheng’s final decision was to go with Chen Zifeng, Ling Luochen, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>There were seven people on each end, but both teams had already been completely broken up.</p>
 <p>This match was led by Ma Xiaotao and Dai Yaoheng with the intention to learn from one another. Even though this match was primarily meant for both parties to fiercely compete with each other based on strength alone, it was similarly testing their abilities to select their team members as well. In a team battle, one would display different combat strengths when put in different groups.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan hugged his huge alcohol calabash and laughed mischievously. He then said, “Very well. Since you guys have finished choosing your members, I will give you ten minutes to plan your tactics. After ten minutes, the match will start. The losing party… Well… You can just scream this sentence - ‘I am a pig’ and that’ll be fine.”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, this was a peculiar punishment, causing Wang Dong to break out in laughter.</p>
 <p>There were seven people on both parties. The distance between both parties naturally grew as they went to stand on each opposite ends of the assessment area.</p>
 <p>Gong Yangmo spoke to Ma Xiaotao in a low voice, “Xiaotao, why didn’t you choose a Control System Battle Soul Master? Didn’t I say that you can’t put Xi Xi in?! But you also know that if you don’t have a control-type in a team battle, we will be at a huge disadvantage. We usually conduct drills together, so you should also be very clear as to how powerful Ling Luochen and Yao Haoxuan are together as control-types. Even though I can barely act as a control-type, I am not a true control-type after all is said and done.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao glared at him and said, “Do I need you to teach me what to do? You just need to do everything you can to assist everyone when the match starts. I’ll take care of Dai Yaoheng, but I can’t finish him off in a short period of time. I can only do my best and help the rest of you. Xi Xi, I’ll hand Chen Zifeng over to you.”</p>
 <p>Xi Xi frowned a little. “Shouldn’t I take care of Ling Luochen first?”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao shook her head and said, “Ling Luochen has Yao Haoxuan by his side. You will be at a disadvantage because Yao Haoxuan’s ability can restrain you. Relax, I have a plan. Bei Bei, follow Xi Xi when the time comes. Both of you have lightning abilities, so you’ll complement one another. You guys need to get rid of Chen Ziheng at the quickest possible moment, then you guys can focus on helping the others. Since we just put these two teams together, I know there isn’t going to be much rapport between us in the upcoming confrontation. The most it’s going to be is a battle between individuals. Caitou, I know that you’re a very talented outer courtyard student from the Soul Tool Department. You don’t need to hold back for later, and can shower them with omni-directional explosive attacks.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” He Caitou replied.</p>
 <p>Only then did Ma Xiaotao shift her gaze to Huo Yuhao. There was an odd expression on her face as she chuckled. “Little Yuhao, elder sister did not pick you because we are personally on good terms. Elder Xuan only allowed me to choose two people from the starting lineup. You are the key as to whether we can win this battle or not, so you better go all out. I’ll give you and Wang Dong the authority to battle as you please. Let me see just how far you can go. Moreover, I’ll hand the team’s control over to you. Even if you can’t control your opponents, the best you can do is control the people on your team. Can you do that?”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but avert his gaze, seeing as there was somewhat of a playful look in Ma Xiaotao’s eyes. He had no choice but to nod and say, “I’ll do my best.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao snorted and said, “Doing your best is out of the question. We must definitely win. If you let this old woman scream that line as punishment, then you better be prepared for the consequences.” After she finished talking, she straightened her back and almost knocked into Huo Yuhao. A valiant aura suddenly rose around her as Ma Xiaotao turned around and looked at their opponents in the distance, “Is Dai Yaoheng not satisfied that I got to lead the team when I returned? If so, then this old woman will beat him up till he’s satisfied.”</p>
 <p>“Elder sister Xiaotao, I have a question.” Wang Dong suddenly spoke.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao glanced at him and asked, “What’s the question?”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong said, “I’ve heard that there needs to be a student from the Soul Tool Department amongst Shrek’s Seven Monsters. But… there isn’t one amongst your group.”</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao indifferently said, “We originally had one, but he was eliminated after I returned. No one is indispensable on this team; if we have to get rid of one person, we can deal with not having a Soul Tool Master.”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and He Caitou frowned hearing her say that. Even though Ma Xiaotao didn’t intentionally direct those words at the Soul Tool Department, it was extremely easy to discern from her tone that the Soul Tool Department didn’t have a position in the inner courtyard.</p>
 <p>The ten minutes were up quickly. Dai Yueheng had evidently made certain arrangements on his end too. Both parties faced each other from opposite ends of the assessment area.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan’s voice rang out once more. “From now on, you are not students, but enemies. I don’t need to tell you what to do to fight over the title of not being a pig. All of you don’t need to hold back. Start!”</p>
 <p>Both parties were still extremely far away from each other right now. When he shouted “start”, both teams immediately moved.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was the first to rush out. Once the tips of her toes touched the ground, she was like an arrow, shooting straight out at lightning speed. Fiery feathers suddenly appeared, and following that, a radiant glow burned fiercely in her eyes.</p>
 <p>A strong reddish-gold flame burst forth, lighting up the whole field.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong had personally seen how Ma Xiaotao was like when she launched an all out attack. When they saw the flames from her Evil Phoenix, they were suddenly fired up. They had never expected that they’d actually get to fight alongside Ma Xiaotao so soon.</p>
 <p>However, Ma Xiaotao’s opponent was Dai Yueheng’s team. As a result of that, she clearly wasn’t as fierce and quick compared to when she was when dealing with those soul masters who wanted to kill Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong last time. She intentionally controlled the speed at which she was advancing, and maintained the formation she had with her team members behind her.</p>
 <p>Xi Xi also made a move at the same time Ma Xiaotao advanced forwards. She was much faster than the outer courtyard students anticipated, and was even faster than Ma Xiaotao. In a flash, she was right behind Ma Xiaotao. It seemed as though her whole body had already fused into Ma Xiaotao’s flames. However, the moment she disappeared, Ma Xiaotao’s blazing phoenix flames seemed somewhat colder than before.</p>
 <p>Two magnificent pairs of wings simultaneously appeared on the battlefield. One of them was naturally Wang Dong’s Radiant Butterfly Goddess. Radiant rays of light flickered in blue and gold as he unfurled his wings. However, Wang Dong didn’t take flight, rather he held Huo Yuhao’s hand as they quickly dashed forwards with the help of his wings.</p>
 <p>The other magnificent pair of wings didn’t lose to the Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings in terms of beauty. The other person had huge wings with feathers that comprised of all the colours of the rainbow. Starting with red feathers on the person’s back, the colors spread out till the tips of the wings were purple. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Those seven colours were pure and sparkled in the light. When he took flight, it was just as though a rainbow was hovering in the sky.</p>
 <p>This gorgeous pair of wings belonged to the elegant Gong Yangmo. In this moment, his long hair had similarly turned into the colors of the rainbow. There was also white scales on his skin. On the whole, it was just like he’d turned into a huge colorful bird. The only difference between him and birds was that his legs seemed to have thickened a bit, with scales faintly flashing at his ankles.</p>
 <p>What was this martial soul? The outer courtyard disciples had also learned about many martial souls, but they hadn’t heard about a martial soul like Gong Yangmo’s before. The rarity of said martial soul could be compared to the Radiant Butterfly Goddess.</p>
 <p>He Caitou wasn’t fast, but one shouldn’t forget that he was a Rank 4 Soul Tool Master. Rays of light suddenly shone on his back, brazenly indicating that the propeller had been activated. Moreover, he’d dragged Bei Bei along with him and caught up to Ma Xiaotao, not slowing down in the slightest.</p>
 <p>At this moment, their formation was as follows: Gong Yangmo was in the sky. Ma Xiaotao, Xi Xi, Bei Bei and He Caitou were in front with Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong behind them.</p>
 <p>On the other end, Dai Yaoheng’s team similarly got into formation. Dai Yaoheng took the lead and released the white tiger martial soul unique to the White Tiger Duke’s Mansion. A netherworldly glint shone in his eyes that had two pupils in them. They were filled with an intense desire to fight.</p>
 <p>Chen Zifeng was on his left, whereas Xu Sanshi was on his right. Jiang Nannan on the other hand, was behind Dai Yaoheng. Three Control System Battle Soul Masters were following them further behind the group.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen, Yao Haoxuan and Xiaoxiao were standing next to each other. The trio released their martial souls one after the other.</p>
 <p>The seven on their end were arranged in a three-one-three formation.</p>
 <p>Seven versus seven. A match between the students from the inner and outer courtyard as well as the Shrek’s Seven Monsters was about to begin.</p>
 <p>Amongst everyone present on the battlefield, the conspicuous ones weren’t the two Soul Emperors who were charging forth, ahead from everyone else in their own pack. Rather, Huo Yuhao was the one who caught everyone’s eye as a Soul Master with only two soul rings. His two white soul rings were really too striking!</p>
 <p>When Gong Yangmo saw Huo Yuhao’s white soul rings as he flew in the sky, he almost fell down. He really wanted to question when the Shrek Academy had a student who had two ten-year-old soul rings. Moreover, this student could even become a core disciple. If that wasn’t enough, this student was also part of the Shrek’s Seven Monster’s reserve team. It seemed as though Ma Xiaotao valued him highly too.</p>
