He was a little apologetic as he said, “Sorry, I was in a special situation the last six months.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Follow me. I’ll return your spirit now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing his words, Na Na appeared much more relieved. For some reason, she deeply trusted him. It might be because of his embarrassment the other time, but Na Na’s face turned hot as she thought of that incident. After she pondered the matter, she realized she had been too desperate. It was just that…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As her thoughts were a little messy, she followed Huo Yuhao to his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t ask her to sit down. He was still reeling from that previous incident! He was awkward when he saw Na Na again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “As you suspected, your spirit was sealed by me. My martial soul is spiritual in nature, and your soul skill has some form of spirituality to it. That’s why I could repress it like this. Try to use your Avenging Spirit less frequently in the future. While it’s powerful, you’ll be in deep trouble if your opponent can do this to you. After all, it’s not going to be a simple spar when you fight outside of the academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Na Na nodded her head, looking very obedient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t want her to stay for too long, just in case he was reminded of what he shouldn’t have seen again. He shut his eyes and muttered an incantation. His right hand pressed against his head and a small ball of golden light was released from his forehead under the guidance of his index finger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Focus, relax, and don’t resist.” Huo Yuhao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na quickly relaxed and shut her eyes. She waited quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s index finger pointed forward, and the ball of golden light shot into her forehead. She jerked suddenly, and couldn’t help but tremble. A layer of gold light stretched from her head down to her toes before it rose all the way to her head again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao retracted his right hand and took a careful look at her. Elder Yi had taught him this method to return her spirit, but it was still his first time using it. He was also a little anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Na Na recovered quickly. When she opened her eyes again, a golden glow flashed across them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s done?” Huo Yuhao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na nodded hurriedly and excitedly. “My spirit feels much more condensed, even my martial soul feels stronger. Thank you. How did you do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao hesitated for a moment and replied, “That’s my secret. I can’t tell you.” He really couldn’t tell Na Na that her spirit was kept within his spiritual sea for some time, and thus it had transformed along with his spiritual power, and gained benefits when he reached the level of the Boundless Ocean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na didn’t probe further. However, she now looked at Huo Yuhao in a different light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Alright, I’ve returned your spirit. If there’s nothing else, go back and rest early. You must meditate and cultivate when you get back so that you can stabilize your spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Na Na acknowledged his words before moving to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow slightly. After all, he had returned her spirit readily. However, she didn’t even say any words of farewell to him. Even so, it was still a good thing that she made herself scarce. He’d finally managed to settle this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he was quickly left wide-eyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That’s because Na Na didn’t leave the room when she got to the door. She shut the door that he’d intentionally left ajar, and even locked it. Huo Yuhao could clearly recall that she had stripped naked after doing that before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’re you doing?” Huo Yuhao was frantic as he reached in front of Na Na and tried to grab her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na shook her body and stepped to one side, and Huo Yuhao grabbed nothing but air. Huo Yuhao wasn’t really Na Na’s match in terms of speed, since she was an agility-type Soul King from the Active Control Soul Tool Department. Her Specter was also very effective at increasing her speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao became alarmed and was ready to take action, Na Na did something unexpected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she avoided him, she quickly collapsed to her knees. Huo Yuhao missed as he tried to grab her shoulder again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What, what are you doing?” Huo Yuhao took two steps back, and was shocked as he looked at Na Na.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na’s eyes turned red. “Huo Yuhao, please help me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get up first.” Huo Yuhao turned away from her, and implied that he wouldn’t accept her behavior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na shook her head forcefully. She also started to tear up, “Let me kneel as I plead to you. I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you continue acting like this, I’ll chase you out.” Huo Yuhao interjected decisively. As he spoke, he walked to the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!” Na Na grabbed hold of his legs and stuck her body to them. She sobbed as she said, “Don’t chase me out. I’ll stand up to speak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she said it, she stood up, using Huo Yuhao as her support. She lowered her head in tears, like she had committed some kind of mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s heart softened, and he pointed to a chair on the side. “Take a seat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na walked towards the chair obediently and softly said, “Will you listen to my story?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed bitterly. “Will you leave if I don’t let you tell it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Na Na blushed and said, “I come from a noble family. My father was a baron of the Sun Moon Empire, it was considered the lowest rank of nobility. Although we didn’t have land, we had some estates and shops. We were quite well-off. My father’s innate martial soul had no soul power, so he couldn’t become a soul master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My parents met because of a coincidence. My father was out on a leisurely trip and bumped into my mother, critically injured after hunting soul beasts. My mother fainted just as she saw my father. He saved her and helped her to escape danger. However, he had no choice but to bring her home because her injuries were too serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She recuperated for a month before she was fully recovered. My father’s meticulous care touched her, and on the day she was supposed to leave, he asked her to stay and expressed his love for her. However, she told him that she was an inauspicious character, and that letting her stay would only bring him harm. But he was stubborn, and told her he wasn’t afraid. He wasn’t a superstitious person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The look in Na Na’s eyes became obscure while she recounted memories of the past. Huo Yuhao was also listening seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My mother was moved after interacting with him for a month and experiencing his meticulous care. After hesitating, she decided to stay. Their relationship blossomed, and they got married three months later. After a year, I was born.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“While my father was of nobility, he was a kind person. He was very nice to all our tenants. After my mother married him, she stayed at home. Before I was six, we led a happy life. Until someone…”</span></p>

One day, my mother told my father that she was going somewhere. I was still small, and pestered my mom to let me follow her. I only found out later that she was going hunting for soul beasts again. Her soul power had reached a bottleneck, and she needed a soul ring to achieve a breakthrough. My mother was a born a commoner, and her cultivation was self-achieved. When she was small, she had attended an elementary soul master academy and learned some simple knowledge, but couldn’t continue her education afterwards, because she was broke. However, she managed to reach Rank 40 based on her own abilities when I was six years old, and became a Soul Ancestor. For an ordinary person, that was a very rare thing.</span></p>

After six months, she returned with a dismal look on her face. My father was too delighted at her return back then, and didn’t realize anything was amiss. She managed to obtain her soul ring. My martial soul was also awakened by then. Like my mother, my martial soul was a Specter.</span></p>

I don’t know what they said to her, but she had to leave with them. My father tried to stop them, but he couldn’t. From that day on, it became a nightmare for my family. My mother kept on leaving the house, and she left for a long intervals of time. She always looked very depressed when she returned, but her abilities kept getting stronger and stronger. Eventually, I was sent to a soul master academy to study. At the start, I wasn’t clear about what was going on at home. However, I realized some valuable items were missing from my home when I returned one day. My father seemed feeble and older, and my mother still rarely came home.”</span></p>

However, he didn’t say anything, and only sighed. I tried to ask my mother, but I couldn’t even see her. When I was twelve, someone came to the academy… to tell me that my father… had passed away.”</span></p>

It was like he saw something he couldn’t understand.”</span></p>
