 <p><strong>Book 9: Escape</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 59.3: The Berserk Flamedevil Ma Xiaotao!</strong></p>
 <p>The fury of Shrek Academy was something that even the White Tiger Duke’s Mansion, who controlled over ten thousand men in the Star Luo Empire, couldn’t endure.</p>
 <p>The academy didn’t escalate the situation due to the lack of proof, but they were only suppressing their anger for the time being.</p>
 <p>The next morning. Dai Huabin’s expression greatly changed when he saw the somewhat dispirited Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong come to class, but he was still a son of the White Tiger Duke. Though he was greatly astonished, he quickly masked any overt changes on his face.</p>
 <p>He hadn’t received any information as to what had occurred last night and had hoped that the final outcome wouldn’t be too messy. As long as his men hadn’t been injured, all would be fine. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be able to explain himself to his father!</p>
 <p>Cold sweat imperceptibly began to drench the back of Dai Huabin’s shirt. A Soul Emperor and five Soul Kings together were not enough to kill the two of them. Remorse began to blossom in the depths of his heart.</p>
 <p>“Dai Huabin.” Huo Yuhao’s eyesight was extremely good, and thus he was able to instantly see Dai Huabin, who had been staring at them with a bewildered look in his eyes. He then pulled Wang Dong along with him and took large strides towards him.</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin’s face was somewhat pale. At the end of the day, he was only a youth around the age of ten and thus couldn’t conceal his emotions very well.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s eyes turned cold as he saw Dai Huabin and was just about to charge straight towards him when Huo Yuhao hurriedly held onto him.</p>
 <p>“What do you want?” Dai Huabin asked coldly.</p>
 <p>As he tightly held onto Wang Dong so as to not let him fly into a rage, Huo Yuhao spoke in a deep voice. “Didn’t you lose that bet we made the other day? Come on, fulfill your promise now.”</p>
 <p>It was now time for students to go to class, and so there was an endless stream of students walking past their classroom. They were all second year students and were naturally aware of the grudges between Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Dai Huabin. A large number of students had already stopped by the side to watch the proceedings.</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin gritted his teeth and clenched his fists tightly, making the veins on his forehead pop out.</p>
 <p>Zhu Lu walked out from Class 2 and stood in front of Dai Huabin as she yelled, “Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, don’t be too excessive!”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong replied icily, “We’re being excessive? Go ask him what he did last night. I’m just not sure whether or not he’ll have the guts to reveal what he did.”</p>
 <p>Dai Huabin gritted his teeth as he responded, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
 <p>Wang Dong snorted disdainfully. “I knew you were a scaredy-cat. Regardless of whether or not you admit to what you did. You have to kowtow towards us now since you lost, man up and admit your loss.”</p>
 <p>Zhu Lu was about to confront them but she was shoved from behind by the flustered Dai Huabin. He didn’t dare to confirm whether or not his men had been exposed. This matter was simply too important and was even related to the White Tiger Duke’s Mansion. No matter what, he absolutely couldn’t reveal that he was guilty. Otherwise, it would affect the relationship between Shrek Academy and the White Tiger Duke’s Mansion and might even cause hostility between the former and the Star Luo Empire.</p>
 <p>He took a deep breath as shoved the rancor and humiliation he felt into the depths of his heart. He abruptly dropped to his knees and kowtowed three times towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong while shouting, “I was wrong.” Following which, he stood up and returned to his class.</p>
 <p>The rancor in Zhu Lu’s eyes was no less than in Dai Huabin’s. After all, the person who’d been humiliated was her future boyfriend! She pointed her slightly trembling finger towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong, “You just wait, just wait…”</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao acted as if he’d heard nothing as then turned back to Class 1 along with Wang Dong. Right now, he wasn’t feeling elated but vigilant. He’d made Dai Huabin kowtow in front of so many students but the latter still hadn’t flown into a rage. An enemy like this was much more terrifying, especially so given Dai Huabin’s relatively astonishing growth. Unfortunately, he didn’t suffer any sort of punishment after the ambush he’d planned.</p>
 <p>What Huo Yuhao didn’t know, however, was the fact that Dai Huabin had been put on the academy’s blacklist due to the ambush he’d set up. Though they didn’t have any concrete proof, just who was Shrek Academy have? From the mere scraps they had, they were able to deduce a lot of things. However, they were still afraid of the consequences of their actions; making the Star Luo Empire an enemy for the sake of two students was clearly an unwise decision. Furthermore, when all was said and done, this was something that’d been organised by Dai Huabin alone. Because of this, the extraordinarily talented Dai Huabin was destined to not enter the inner courtyard the instant he failed to kill Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>The advancement test had already ended, and every single person who could continue going to class had passed it. Students who hadn’t passed could retake the test three days later but they would be forced to leave the academy if they failed that test too.</p>
 <p>The class that Wang Yan and Zhou Yi taught, Class 1, had an astonishing 95% pass rate. The facts had shown that putting the two of them together was extremely effective.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi could manage her students well while Wang Yan had a vast amount of knowledge and a warm teaching style. Combined with the truly outstanding batch of students that came this year, there were only a few people who weren’t able to pass the advancement test. Moreover, they still had the chance to retake the exam.</p>
 <p>Comparatively, there were far more students from the other classes who had been eliminated.</p>
 <p>“Yuhao, why didn’t you let me settle my grudges with him?” Wang Dong asked Huo Yuhao furiously.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “The academy didn’t deliver a verdict, so what can we do ourselves? We’re all in the academy so there won’t be a conclusion to this matter even if we try to settle our grudges with him. Let’s just stay quiet and keep a watch on him. It’s still more important for us to work hard and increase our strength. When we can reach senior sister Xiaotao’s level of strength, we won’t need to be afraid of any ambushes anymore.”</p>
 <p>The battle yesterday had stimulated him greatly, but it clearly wasn’t possible for him to increase his cultivation by a large amount within a short period of time. However, soul tools could increase his survivability. Thus, he had already planned to use the next few days to modify his set of soul tools. At the very least, he wanted to make sure that all of them were Class 2 tools. If he and Wang Dong had possessed a Class 2 thruster when they were ambushed, they wouldn’t have been left in such a miserable state.</p>
 <p>“Wah, I really can’t help but think about it!” Wang Dong stared at the classroom door.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao subconsciously followed his gaze to see a red-clothed Ma Xiaotao standing outside the classroom and waving to him.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao’s physical state didn’t seem right. Her charming face was flushed red and there was even a faint red light shining from her body.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao questioningly pointed towards himself and Ma Xiaotao nodded before turning around and leaving.</p>
 <p>There was still some time before class began so Huo Yuhao hurriedly turned towards Wang Dong, “If I come back late, help me out. I’m going to see why senior sister Xiaotao’s looking for me.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Wang Dong also felt that something about Ma Xiaotao wasn’t quite right. If this was before yesterday, he definitely wouldn’t have allowed Huo Yuhao to go alone. However, he wasn’t wary towards Ma Xiaotao since she had saved them yesterday.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao quickly left the class. The moment he walked out of the door, he felt a wave of red light surge towards him. Regardless of how precise his Spiritual Detection was, he wasn’t able to dodge it at all. A wave of heat immediately engulfed his entire body.</p>
 <p>The source of that heat was Ma Xiaotao’s body.</p>
 <p>The twenty-or-so-year-old Ma Xiaotao was at the most beautiful period of her life, and she was also extremely beautiful from the start. At this moment, her flushed cheeks made her even more of a radiant beauty.</p>
 <p>She let out a sweet moan as she hugged Huo Yuhao,, “Huo Yuhao, I can’t... I can’t hold it anymore. Quickly.”</p>
 <p>Her voice was relatively loud and not only did the students who were passing by hear her but even the students from Class 1 did as well. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao was currently in front of the classroom door. As he was hugged by the fiery Ma Xiaotao, it was absolutely impossible for him to struggle free.</p>
 <p>A red light flickered and Ma Xiaotao suddenly accelerated and disappeared from the end of the corridor with Huo Yuhao in tow.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong immediately felt that something was off. He hastily ran outside, but he could only see the back of Ma Xiaotao’s body by the time he got there.</p>
 <p>There were still a few students in the corridor who were looking at each other.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s expression became pale. He was just about to chase after them, but an arm suddenly stopped him the moment he took a step forward.</p>
 <p>“Unhand me!” Wang Dong flew into a rage. However, he was immediately sent into a daze when he turned around. The person who’d grabbed him was Zhou Yi.</p>
 <p>“What’s the matter? Why’re you being so impatient?” Zhou Yi spoke in a low voice. Though she liked the two of them, in accordance with her philosophy of teaching, she definitely wouldn’t allow her students to go against her.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong said urgently, “Teacher Zhou, Huo Yuhao has been taken away by Ma Xiaotao. Please go rescue him quickly! I feel that there’s something wrong with her. In the event he’s harmed by her…”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yi pulled him back to the classroom, “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen. Dean Yan has already notified me of this. Ma Xiaotao’s martial soul is rather special, and Yuhao’s second martial soul can help her cultivation. Furthermore, this will be somewhat useful for him. Go back to your seat, we’re about to start class.”</p>
 <p>With that, Zhou Yi shut the door to the classroom.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong’s sense of urgency didn’t subside as a result of Zhou Yi’s explanation. On the contrary, it became even more intense. He naturally knew that Huo Yuhao wouldn’t be injured by Ma Xiaotao but the worry he felt intensified exponentially when he saw the image of Ma Xiaotao hugging Huo Yuhao in his mind.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Huo Yuhao’s mind was blank. He naturally knew that Ma Xiaotao wouldn’t hurt him, and moreover, he had seen her berserk appearance before. Only, he was somewhat embarrassed due to the big beauty hugging him out of the blue.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao didn’t have any perfume on her, but she nonetheless smelled rather refreshing. She smelled like sun-dried blankets, relaxing and clean. Unfortunately, she wasn’t warm like a blanket but somewhat scalding instead.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao was extremely slender and she continued to run as she hugged Huo Yuhao. The latter only saw the scenery around him alternating unceasingly while the blank feeling he felt in his heart only grew stronger.</p>
 <p>Within the blink of an eye, they’d left the school building. Ma Xiaotao rushed towards Sea God’s Lake with Huo Yuhao in tow where she finally took a breather. “Yu… Hao… quickly… help me. I… can’t hold it anymore… I need… your Ice element… help… me suppress… my Evil Fire… Quickly…” she stammered.</p>
