 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao managed to sit for half a day. Xuan Ziwen was rather pleased with that.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At least this kid isn’t impatient, and is quite clear about the basics. Given his spiritual power and intelligence, it shouldn’t be too difficult for him to understand the core formation of a Class 9 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xuan Ziwen started to be unable to take it after observing Huo Yuhao for some time. He didn’t sleep almost the entire night! He was feeling a little fatigued by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, he unwittingly leaned on the laboratory desk and fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slept rather well. The Tang Sect’s Soul Tool Hall was now on the right track. What Xuan Ziwen needed to attend to was only some of his own research. He was much more relaxed compared to before. However, he still had high expectations for himself. It was his first time sleeping in the day for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he slept well, he would be in better spirits too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xuan Ziwen woke up from his nap, he only felt recharged and extremely comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was no one in the laboratory when he opened his eyes. Yes, there was no one else apart from him. Huo Yuhao had left to some unknown place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This rascal. Did he flee?” Xuan Ziwen was astonished. If Huo Yuhao really wanted to leave, he really had no choice too. If he ran away, Xuan Ziwen was certainly unable to bring him back!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen leapt up in astonishment, and rushed out to find Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the door to the laboratory opened, and Huo Yuhao walked leisurely in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rascal, what are you doing? Did my words fall on deaf ears? Didn’t I say that you can’t go out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao snapped, “Teacher Xuan, you told me to eat, poop and sleep in here. However, I must be able to do all these first! You don’t even have a grain of rice here. I can’t possibly starve myself. I’m the flower of this empire, yet to fully bloom. I need nutrition. I only went to get some food from the canteen. I brought some for you too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, he carefully placed the lunchboxes in his hand on the table before taking one box for himself and digging in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen didn’t even realize that he had maligned Huo Yuhao, and only grabbed one lunchbox before starting to stuff himself with food. The food in the Tang Sect had always been good. After sleeping an entire afternoon, it felt really comfortable to stuff himself with delicacies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Very soon, he finished all his food. To defend his honor as a man, Xuan Ziwen took the initiative to clear the boxes and utensils.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he cleared up, he asked Huo Yuhao, “Have you learned something after seeing the blueprints for an entire afternoon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I’m doing pretty well. I’m getting ready to start on my second core formation.” Huo Yuhao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen glared at him and said, “It’s not good to be greedy. Digest the first one before going to the next. Each of these thirteen core formations is different. Each of them…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke until here, he couldn’t continue anymore. This was because Huo Yuhao had stuffed a metal ball the size of a tangerine into his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This metal ball was hollow, and there were lights shining inside of it. There seemed to be some kind of circulation within its complicated structure, based on the principles of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This, this…you’ve come up with this first core formation?” Xuan Ziwen’s voice changed slightly. He was just like an adolescent whose voice broke for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao answered, “Yes! It’s not that difficult. I’m already on my second one.” As he spoke, he started reading the second blueprint.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen grabbed the first core formation and started to frantically search for something on the laboratory table. Indeed, he found a patch of dense powder. It was something that was definitely left behind during the creation of a core formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took an afternoon to understand the core formation of a Class 9 soul tool and finish constructing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Xuan Ziwen was the one who wanted to vomit blood. He knew that he wasn’t capable of this. The creation of the core formation didn’t drain as much soul power as carving the outer shell. However, the details were much finer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He managed to complete it? No, that’s impossible!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen quickly raised the core formation in his hand and used all the methods that he knew to analyze its structure. He did all he could to find a flaw or a problem with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two hours passed, but he didn’t find anything wrong. There was no problem!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How is this possible? How is this possible?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Whatever was going on with Huo Yuhao completely violated the principles of a soul master’s development. Yes, it was a violation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen couldn’t believe that this was real. He took a serious look at Huo Yuhao, who was invested in the second blueprint by now. His heart was contorting. However, Xuan Ziwen was determined not to miss out on watching Huo Yuhao create his second core formation. He had to watch it and find out for himself how Huo Yuhao managed to magically create a core formation in such a short period of time. He had to have some special method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A determined Xuan Ziwen was full of willpower. He just sat there and opened his eyes wide as he watched Huo Yuhao. He didn’t neglect the smallest of details. He was just watching like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was a little creeped out as he was being watched so intently. He occasionally took a glance at Xuan Ziwen. However, he still thought that the blueprint he was reading was much more mesmerizing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He only put the blueprint of the second core formation down in the evening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stood up and stretched. He even let out a comfortable groan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you done?” Xuan Ziwen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen asked, “Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Huo Yuhao nodded seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you waiting for then? Why aren’t you striking when the iron is hot, and working on the core formation?” Xuan Ziwen screamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao appeared a little indignant. “But it’s dinnertime! I’ll go and grab dinner first. I’ll start after dinner.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was anxious as he said, “I can help you collect dinner!” As he spoke, he turned into a complete gentleman and left the laboratory with the lunchboxes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was some discrepancy in their judgment of when mealtime was, such that Xuan Ziwen waited a good fifteen minutes in the canteen before he came back with food. He was even rushing the staff in the canteen. Along with some delays in the journey, he took a total of thirty minutes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was a little depressed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If I knew it was going to take so long, I would have let that kid go and collect dinner. At least he can relax for a bit. I wonder if he has started with the core formation. It’s fine if he’s started, but if he’s skiving while I’m collecting dinner… hmph!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he returned, Xuan Ziwen saw Huo Yuhao sitting exactly where he was before. Huo Yuhao was shaking his head, as if he were thinking of something. However, there was nothing in his hands. They were empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well done, rascal. Do you really take me as your manual laborer? You didn’t even do anything at all.” Xuan Ziwen was unhappy as he threw the lunchboxes at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao jumped in shock. He quickly caught the lunchboxes. “Teacher, what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen was furious, “I went to collect dinner so that you’d have more time to work on your core formation. I didn’t leave you to rest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m done!” Huo Yuhao appeared very innocent as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re done? Where?” Xuan Ziwen was in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grabbed a metal ball from the side of the table and presented it to Xuan Ziwen, “Here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen subconsciously received the metal ball. He lowered his head and took a look at it. When he saw it, his eyes opened wide.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t be bothered with scolding Huo Yuhao anymore. He quickly sat down at one side and analyzed the metal ball. A sneaky smile flashed across Huo Yuhao’s face. He placed the lunchboxes on the table and started to dig in. He had been using a lot of his energy over the past day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished his food, he said very naturally, “Teacher Xuan, I’m almost done with all my work today. I’ll go back and rest first. Goodbye!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Xuan Ziwen’s attention was all on the metal ball. He agreed subconsciously, and Huo Yuhao quickly fled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen didn’t even react. &nbsp;He had mentioned that he wasn’t going to let Huo Yuhao go earlier, but he couldn’t be bothered now, as he was too dumbfounded by the metal ball in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the second core formation out of the thirteen core formations needed for the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A complete second core formation! Just by touching it, Xuan Ziwen could sense from the soul power undulations from the ball that it was free of problems. It was exactly what he wanted. He checked the details carefully, and hoped to find some kind of flaw with it. However, everything was in vain. This core formation was perfect. It was comparable to the first core formation earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How is this possible? How is it possible! This is a core formation for a Class 9 soul tool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though a pill furnace wasn’t considered one of the more complex Class 9 soul tools and only barely made it as a Class 9 soul tool, it was still a Class 9 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Generally speaking, a Class 9 soul engineer would need at least three months to half a year to complete a Class 9 soul tool, even if he was completely prepared. One of the most important reasons was that the core formations of a Class 9 soul tool were simply too complex. Some mistakes were bound to be made during the process of creating them. When the soul engineer had to start over, resources and time would be wasted. As a result, the soul engineer had to be extremely focused, and tried to keep his energy level at its maximum. This was so that he could finish the core formations and ensure the greatest success rate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xuan Ziwen hadn’t had time to teach Huo Yuhao yet. He wanted to let Huo Yuhao fail once first, and use the failure to teach him. This would make him remember his mistakes more clearly. However, who knew that Huo Yuhao wouldn’t give him the chance to let him fail.</span></p>
