His mind was calm, so his performance would be smooth, composed, and natural. He tapped lightly on his leaf with the tips of his toes, and his entire body soared into the sky. He was light as a feather, as if there were no gravity or resistance to his movements at all, and the little Snow Lady on his shoulders didn’t even quiver a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He drifted five to six meters forward before he tapped on the water’s surface with the tip of his foot. Chilly air condensed into a patch of ice and supported his body as he glided forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Huo Yuhao, and I’ll be seventeen this year. I am both a control-type and assault-type Soul King, and I’m also a Class 6 soul engineer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once he stopped here, the girls before him all showed expressions of surprise. The Golden Crow Holy Lady was the most short-tempered, and she couldn’t control herself as she raised her hand and said, “Wait, wait. Eldest senior sister, there’s something I don’t understand—can I ask him a question?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan replied, “Just one. There won’t be a next one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Wu Ming answered happily, then asked Huo Yuhao, “Are you deliberately giving yourself so many titles to attract the girls? Both control-type and assault-type? How is that separated? Are you telling me you have two martial souls? And you’re a Class 6 soul engineer on top of that? You’re only seventeen this year—are you a fighter that can do everything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Greetings, senor sister. I do have two martial souls. My main martial soul is control-type, while my secondary martial soul is assault-type. I’m part of the Soul Tool Department at the same time, so I’m also a soul engineer. I’ve just returned a few days ago from my exchange program at the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming was stunned momentarily, and asked in astonishment, “Twin martial souls?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had quite a reputation in the outer courtyard, but he didn’t have much in the inner courtyard. Furthermore, he had been away from the academy for more than two years, and those people who had initially had an impression of him would have forgotten. The words “twin martial souls” were uttered once more, and several girls’ eyes sparkled, especially the younger ones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The inner courtyard’s students were very clear on what having twin martial souls implied. If a soul master with twin martial souls could become a Titled Douluo, and obtain enough soul rings for his or her second martial soul, then this person would be able to challenge a formidable Transcendent Douluo at Rank 91. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao’s twin martial souls were control-type and assault-type respectively, so one was complementary to the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan smiled and said, “Continue, Yuhao. You have thirty seconds left.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded in her direction and said, “All of you must be a little tired after standing for so long. Everyone should know what the Snow Lady can do—so let me help everyone relax a little.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his voice dropped, the Snow Lady was telepathically connected to him, and she flew out at once. Orange-gold light flickered as she came before the girls. “Yi yi ya ya!’” She called as the orange-gold light became even denser than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao flashed his own soul rings as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One red and four orange soul rings rose up from beneath his feet. The blood-red soul ring that had four golden lines and the four orange-gold soul rings that followed closely behind it immediately became the focus of everyone’s attention. Huo Yuhao’s entire aura skyrocketed, and he truly became like a sovereign ruler descending upon the world amidst the sparkling and dazzling soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody began to scream and exclaim in awe and bewilderment. Both the guys and the girls, both Zhang Lexuan and Bei Bei, and even the elders of the Sea God’s Pavilion and the various teachers all had their eyes fixed on Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Orange soul rings? What is happening?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy was most meticulous with martial soul research, but in all their history of soul masters, which included evil soul masters, the Body Sect and all the other powerful soul masters, nobody had ever seen an orange soul ring before. Furthermore, there was a blood-red hundred thousand year soul ring before the four orange soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The various opponents Huo Yuhao had faced in the outer courtyard were less surprised. They knew that Huo Yuhao possessed Imitation, and these five soul rings were probably conjured via said Imitation to please the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just when Huo Yuhao released his fifth soul ring, he chanted under his breath, “The fist and palm will freeze the heavens.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tiny Snow Lady pointed into the sky, and her fat little cheeks became as solemn as could be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Snowflakes drifted from the sky. They weren’t so obvious in the beginning, but it didn’t take long before voluminous snowflakes descended from the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These snowflakes separated into seventeen batches and circled around the girls, eventually congregating beneath their feet. The girls could immediately feel as if they were standing on solid ground, and a layer of thick solid ice with a diameter of over a meter instantly appeared beneath them. They no longer needed to use soul power to make themselves lighter, and they felt a lot more relaxed than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady giggled and flipped back onto Huo Yuhao’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such formidable powers of control! The admiration and awe in the girls’ eyes grew stronger, except for Wu Feng, whose expression turned even darker than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This control of snow didn’t belong to Huo Yuhao, and Huo Yuhao didn’t manipulate anything at all—the Snow Lady was the one who had done everything. She was the Icesky Snow Lady, and also the Snow Empress, who was ranked number three amongst the Ten Great Savage Beasts. Who else in the world could compare to her ability to control snow?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao bowed slightly in an extremely elegant gesture before he slid back and returned to his original position, where he descended back onto his water lily leaf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had further displayed the power of his Spirit. He believed that after the Blind Date, the academy would probably seek him out very quickly. If he could obtain the support of both the academy and his inner courtyard’s seniors, then the research and experimentation with Spirits could begin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back in the Clear Sky Sect, the sect leader, Niu Tian, had said something that greatly moved Huo Yuhao. The growth of soul beasts would never catch up to human soul masters. No matter how few soul masters there were, they would still accumulate power continuously. Even if every soul master had four rings on average, that meant every soul master had to hunt and kill four soul beasts, while these soul beasts ranged from ten years to more than a hundred thousand years old. If this was allowed to continue indefinitely, perhaps the world wouldn’t have soul beasts with high cultivations anymore, and it was even possible that soul beasts could become extinct. The existence of Spirits still couldn’t resolve this problem, but it could alleviate it to some extent, and it could reduce the intensity of the conflict. Huo Yuhao didn’t know how far he could reach, but he was still willing to put in effort to try, so that he could make his own contribution in the conflict between soul masters and soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no doubt that he didn’t really see the Sea God’s Fate as a Blind Date event anymore; his cultivation was more important. The only thing he was looking forward to was the girl who had displayed her second soul ring as a thousand year soul ring. However, Huo Yuhao knew that his hopes only stood at thirty percent. Furthermore, even if that girl was indeed Wang Dong’s sister, and she had the Goddess of Light’s appearance, would she actually like him? How was he going to interact with her? He was truly a little lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s display didn’t have that astounding emotion that He Caitou possessed. However, he did show impressive abilities, and even though five rings was the lowest existence amongst the inner courtyard’s students, he had twin martial souls. Furthermore, he had a Spirit, which was a very peculiar thing to have. Almost all the girls had developed an interest in him for one reason or another, and Huo Yuhao left a strong impression on each and every one of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Love at Second Sight continued, and every male student treasured this self-introduction phase to the best of their ability. After this round, they would only have to go through the fourth round before they could advance into the last round. Whether the girls chose them in the fourth round would determine everything, and everybody had to try their best to display and introduce themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everybody here was a soul master after all, and the most commonplace method of performance was their strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, it was Xu Sanshi’s turn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi didn’t look so well, and it was clear that he had been greatly affected when Jiang Nannan didn’t leave her lamp on for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan frowned faintly and turned around. She didn’t look at Xu Sanshi, who was gliding in her direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi gradually came to a spot ten meters away from her and stopped.</span></p>

I don’t know how many times I’ve confessed to you. My brothers are always asking me, ‘how do I chase a girl?’ I tell them that you have to be courageous, meticulous, and your skin must be thick—this is especially true for the part about being thick-skinned, you really need to have that. If you can put your ego down and fight for her, there will always be a chance of success.”</span></p>

However, Xu Sanshi didn’t laugh, and his face was exceptionally serious.</span></p>

I know that I gave you a bad impression all those years ago, but we’ve known each other for so long—from kids to teenagers, and all the way till now. I trust that you can see how I treat you. I can tell you that I will give everything I have for you—even my life, if I have to. I know that perhaps your answer today will be the same as always, but I still have to try as I always have, and I will never let the opportunity go even if I only have a single thread of a chance. Nannan, can you open up your heart and give me a little gap, so that I can give you love and passionate warmth?”</span></p>

However, one could tell that he was repressing something in that plain attitude. His eyes were determined and persistent, and there were deep-seated sentiments and emotions hidden deep within his eyes.</span></p>

When their gazes met, Jiang Nannan realized to her surprise that two rows of tears were sliding down the corners of Xu Sanshi’s calm face, and his eyes were starting to turn red.</span></p>
