 <p>Twin martial soul? And it was likely that one was an Ultimate martial soul with a cultivation of around two rings. But he was likely able to conceal his own cultivation and abilities.</p> 
 <p>During the last battle, he and his partner had unleashed a series of powerful martial soul fusion skills that earned them victory. He had a partner that also possessed twin martial souls which were compatible with his.</p> 
 <p>This series of information popped up in Jing Hongchen’s mind and made him view Huo Yuhao in a different manner. He even obtained a useful piece of news – Huo Yuhao calling Elder Mu teacher. He was the disciple of a mysterious old man.</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao and the other two came beside Elder Xuan and greeted Jing Hongchen slightly by nodding their heads. They disliked those from the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, and thus they weren’t very formal with their greeting either. Elder Xuan and Elder Mu acted ignorant of the matter.</p> 
 <p>“Follow me.” Elder Xuan walked towards the higher steps and brought them to the third level, whereas Elder Mu remained where he was and shut his eyes. It seemed like he was resting.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen looked at Huo Yuhao interestedly as he walked. He said, “You’re Huo Yuhao? These two must be Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao.” All of their appearances were described in detail in the Illustrious Virtue Hall’s files.</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao nodded but didn’t speak. He was only worried about Ma Xiaotao now.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen wasn’t vexed even though he was being ignored. He only looked at Huo Yuhao seriously. No one knew what he was thinking.</p> 
 <p>Sea God’s Pavilion third level. The first thing that could be seen on this level was a small hall that was around 20 square meters in area. There was a tunnel on each of the two sides that led somewhere deeper. Elder Xuan walked into the left one and stopped at the fifth door.</p> 
 <p>The entire space turned golden as their surroundings flashed instantly at this point. Jing Hongchen’s hands trembled subconsciously, but he soon calmed down. But the intense yet pure undulation of light left him shocked. A sense of peril rose in his heart. He was knowledgeable, but he knew nothing about the mysterious Sea God’s Pavilion. The pure light didn’t seem to be unleashed by someone, but emitted from the wood that surrounded them. What exactly was the Sea God’s Pavilion built from?</p> 
 <p>The door in front opened as the golden light flashed. They walked into a quiet chamber one by one.</p> 
 <p>“Elder sister.” Huo Yuhao saw Ma Xiaotao, who lay flat on the Manifold Mysterious Ice Bed. He was so anxious that he wanted to rush over, but he was stopped by Elder Xuan.</p> 
 <p>Ma Xiaotao looked a little pale, while her originally-red lips were now purplish-black. They carried a sense of evil to them. Her entire body surged with black flames as she was engulfed by the golden light. Although they were repressed by the golden light as soon as they surged slightly, they still appeared to be unyielding.</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan shook his head at the anxious Huo Yuhao. Huo Yuhao bit his lips and his fists clenched unwittingly.</p> 
 <p>It had already been two months since the tournament had ended. He hadn’t expected his elder sister’s condition to be so disastrous. She could only lie on the ice-cold bed, and had to be sealed by the powers of light. Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned red as he looked at Ma Xiaotao’s face and reminisced about her usual shrewishness.</p> 
 <p>Elder Xuan gestured to Jing Hongchen, who stepped forward. He stopped before the light that engulfed Ma Xiaotao and took a careful look at the black flames. After a moment, he said in a deep voice, “Can I get closer to sense the change in her soul power?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes.” Elder Mu’s voice resonated. Following that, everyone was shocked as a golden figure appeared beside Jing Hongchen. This figure belonged to Elder Mu, but it was only an illusory projection of him.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu’s back wasn’t bent over now, but straight. His entire body shone a bright gold. Although it was only a projection, it seemed very real. Everything around him turned golden as he stood there calmly. The intense light circulated in the air and caused Wang Dong’s light-type martial soul to flow out unwittingly. Even his arms that contained soul bones lit up.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen couldn’t control his emotions, and exclaimed, “What soul skill is this?” </p> 
 <p>Although he wasn’t a Transcendent Douluo, he was still a Rank 93 Titled Douluo! But Elder Mu’s current avatar was already beyond the boundaries of his understanding of soul masters. As the best soul engineer in the world, he was certain that this wasn’t achievable using soul tools. Elder Mu was more than just a simple light projection. Jing Hongchen was awed by the immense power that he possessed.</p> 
 <p>A soul master actually possessed such a power? It was an eye-opener for Jing Hongchen. But he was more horrified. He suddenly realized that Elder Mu’s claim that he could stop him from unleashing his soul tools wasn’t a joke.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu lifted his right hand, and a door appeared in the halo that covered Ma Xiaotao’s body. It could squeeze in one person. Ma Xiaotao’s flames didn’t surge violently because of this door either. That was because the entire room was a like a giant light seal that suppressed the black flames in her body.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen took in a deep breath and tried to compose himself. He walked two steps forward to Ma Xiaotao and used his hands to test the black flames that surged from her. After that, he pressed his hand to Ma Xiaotao’s wrist and sensed the condition of her body. He then took two steps back and quickly exited the halo.</p> 
 <p>No one noticed that when he pressed his hand to Ma Xiaotao’s wrist, his fingernails shook slightly. That change wasn’t even noticed by Elder Mu.</p> 
 <p>“I am helpless. This is the backlash of a mutated fire. If I’m not wrong, this young lady already possessed a weird force within her martial soul that affected her. When she was provoked by the Judgement Sword’s dark power, she couldn’t suppress this force in time and unleashed it. This mutated fire that’s filled with darkness and violence took control of her body, and it couldn’t be stopped. It’s already close to the strength of Ultimate fire. If it’s forcefully suppressed or broken down, her body may collapse. Sealing her is the best solution so far. Unless a gentle force can be found to tackle this mutated fire, she’s likely to be controlled by the fire, and her mind will never be clear again once she wakes up.”</p> 
 <p>A cold radiance appeared on Huo Yuhao’s face. He detested that he wasn’t strong enough. He could help his elder sister if he was strong enough. She wouldn’t be in such a state then. There was also the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy. A vicious radiance flashed across his eyes as he looked at Jing Hongchen.</p> 
 <p>“Since you’re helpless too, you don’t have to ask us for anything,” Elder Mu said gradually, “the tournament was a chance for us to interact and exchange tips. We won’t be petty over the damages we suffered during the tournament. Please return to the second level. We can converse there.”</p> 
 <p>After his voice subsided, the surrounding golden light disappeared, and the halo also returned to normal. Elder Mu’s golden illusory projection flashed before disappearing. He naturally wouldn’t explain where this magical avatar of his appeared from to Jing Hongchen.</p> 
 <p>The light in Jing Hongchen’s eyes faded greatly as they returned to the second level. He only felt his head getting heavier. He always reckoned that he could resist Shrek Academy with his soul tools. But he only now realized that the Sun Moon Empire was still inferior in terms of top abilities after he saw Elder Mu.</p> 
 <p>Huo Yuhao and the other two returned to Elder Mu’s side again. Elder Mu laid there and wasn’t any different from before. He still didn’t unleash his powerful aura, and just laid there quietly. But he brought great pressure on Jing Hongchen. This caused Jing Hongchen to start perspiring. He only now realized why the Body Sect left so quickly after seeing Elder Mu.</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu said gradually, “Can you tell me which is better in your opinion – the Illustrious Virtue Hall or Sea God’s Pavilion?”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen was slightly stunned. Elder Mu’s question might seem very vague, but he understood immediately. He was asking about the advantages and disadvantages of soul masters and soul engineers, as well as a comparison between the Illustrious Virtue Hall and Shrek Academy.</p> 
 <p>After pondering for a moment, Jing Hongchen said, “I don’t dare to comment, as I don’t know much about the Sea God’s Pavilion. Let’s take Elder Xuan and I as examples. Elder Xuan will beat me within a hundred meters. But I can perish along with him. If the distance between us is expanded to a thousand meters, I can escape. If it’s ten thousand meters, I am confident of beating Elder Xuan if he doesn’t leave the battlefield of his own accord. In a war, my side will win.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen sounded very resolute and unhesitant as he got to his last sentence. Elder Mu was even a little moved.</p> 
 <p>“It seems like you are very confident.” Elder Mu laughed slightly.</p> 
 <p>Jing Hongchen laughed bitterly. “I believe that you can tell that I lack confidence. Soul tools have an advantage in a war, but Shrek’s position on the continent can’t be shaken in more higher-end battles. Neither the Illustrious Virtue Hall nor the Body Sect can shake Shrek Academy.”</p> 
 <p>Elder Mu stole a glance at him. It was obvious that he could tell the meaning behind his words. If the Illustrious Virtue Hall and Body Sect couldn’t do it themselves, what if they combined their power?</p> 
 <p>“Jing Hongchen, I once went to the Illustrious Virtue Hall. Your development in soul tools is indeed beyond my imagination. I agree with one point of yours. When soul tools no longer rely on soul masters’ soul power one day, soul masters will be eliminated. Just like how soul tools replaced the Tang Sect’s secret weapons. But I have to add something. Even if that day really comes, soul masters will still be the most powerful. That’s because only powerful soul masters can unleash the greatest might of even more powerful soul tools. Do you agree?”</p>
