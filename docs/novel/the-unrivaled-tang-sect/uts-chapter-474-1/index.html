 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said seriously, “In the future, we’ll do our best to become Gods. Once your grandfather becomes a God, we can also enter the God Realm and break free from the limits of this world. This is why you need to fuse with your grandfather. After fusing, you can use this Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence to ensure that your spiritual sense is protected. Things will be fine like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, mom. Whatever you say. I’ll listen to you. I know you won’t harm me. I still thought that you were biased towards Ah Tai. It seems like you’re really biased, but you’re biased towards me! Ah Tai has no chance of becoming a God. Hahahahaha! I’m so happy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s heart couldn’t take it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Ice Bear King has a one-track mind. Is he not worried that he can’t make a successful breakthrough?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he understood why the Snow Empress wanted to pass the position of the leader of the ice plains of the Extreme North to the Tai Tan Snowdevil King, instead of the Ice Bear King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress nodded and said, “It’s good as long as you’re willing to. Because it involves giving up your own body, you have to be completely willing to do so. You can’t be forced at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not forced. I’m not forced at all,” the Ice Bear King said delightedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said, “Alright, you should return to your tribe to recount things to them. Once you leave this time, I’m afraid you won’t have time to return anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright!” the Ice Bear King agreed before turning and rushing off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress laughed, “Little Bai is really that naïve! He hasn’t changed in all these years. He trusts you completely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress smiled and said, “Daddy formed a soul core, and his spiritual power is enough to accommodate another Spirit. Let’s take this spot first before he gives it to his Spirit Eyes. Given Little Bai’s abilities, he can be the eighth and ninth soul rings. When daddy cultivates until he reaches eight rings, he can fuse completely with Little Bai. After that, I’ll help Little Bai suppress some of his powers and wait until daddy reaches Rank 90 before letting him become the ninth soul ring of daddy’s Ultimate Ice martial soul. I’m confident with the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao revealed a bitter smile on his face, “Snow Empress, can you change…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress immediately nodded. “Change it. I can’t stand it, either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress glanced at Huo Yuhao and said, “I’ll change it if you stop being so skeptical in the future. Don’t forget that I’m your first Spirit, and I gave you four soul rings. This means that we are actually very closely connected. Furthermore, because you burned your teacher’s divine senses as an intermediary to connect with my spiritual mind, I’m able to sense everything in your mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was in a daze.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! I completely forgot about that. I’ve been using my mind to control the Snow Lady all this while! After she regained her memory, this became mutual.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a doubt, the Snow Empress must have had sensed his intentions and emotional changes. That was why she mentioned this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress drifted to his side. “Alright, I’ll call you by your name and you’ll call me the Snow Lady. Not only is this less unfamiliar, but it’s also less weird.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, okay.” Huo Yuhao nodded repeatedly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Lady is great. It sounds the most natural.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress’ expression turned slightly weird now. The look in her eyes appeared to be that of jealousy at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress said to Huo Yuhao, “They’ll need some time to return. You can cultivate here first. The environment of the Extreme North is extremely suitable for you to cultivate in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” The Snow Empress’ problem had been settled, and Huo Yuhao was in a good mood right now. He sat cross-legged on the ground and immediately entered a cultivation state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was already the core region of the Extreme North. The temperature was extremely low. If an ordinary person were here, they would become an ice sculpture in just a few breaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In such an extremely chilly environment, the amount of ice was naturally greater than in most other places. Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice martial soul had only fused with a part of the Ice Empress’ strength in the beginning, it wasn’t pure enough yet. However, he had slowly fused with the soul power origin of the Ice Empress as his powers increased. As his own abilities increased, his Ultimate Ice became more and more elemental. This was especially true after he fused with the Snow Empress, who became his Spirit. His Ultimate Ice was slowly becoming stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao did face difficulties in this process. For example, when the Snow Empress poured her ice-type origin energy into him, he was disabled for some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After absorbing the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence, Huo Yuhao’s own condition had improved by leaps and bounds. Such an improvement couldn’t be described physically. Rather, it was the increased sensitivity of his Ultimate Ice. During this process, his Ultimate Ice also started to become more and more extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, to say that something was ‘ultimate’ was just a way of describing it. There was no way such an extreme could ever be achieved. Whether it was Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice, the Snow Empress’ Ultimate Ice, or the Ice Empress’ Ultimate Ice, they couldn’t possibly reach absolute zero.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as Huo Yuhao’s abilities improved and his understanding of Ultimate Ice increased, they kept proceeding in that direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An ice-type soul master could reach just above negative one hundred degrees Celsius, and his soul skills could also reach such a standard. However, more and more ice-type soul masters would fail as the temperature continued to fall. When the temperature reached negative one hundred and fifty degrees Celsius, every unit drop in temperature required not just hard work, but also talent, and a quality martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice was the most terrifying in the sense that it kept on changing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress had reached an all-time low of negative one hundred and ninety degrees Celsius at her peak, whereas the Snow Empress could reach around negative two hundred and five degrees Celsius. These were their limits. These were also the limits of the continent’s ice-type soul beasts and ice-type soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why an Ultimate Ice martial soul referred to a temperature below negative one hundred and fifty degrees Celsius when the martial soul unleashed a soul skill. Initially, Huo Yuhao couldn’t do this when he first fused with the Ice Empress. But as his cultivation improved, he was slowly proceeding in this direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lowest temperature that he could reach now was already far below this temperature. Even though he couldn’t compare to the Snow Empress and Ice Empress at their peaks, he could still control his soul skills to achieve a temperature below negative one hundred and sixty-five degrees Celsius after fusing with the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence. This was the true standard of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially true recently. After the Snow Empress woke up from her sleep, she gave him some guidance. With the Snow Empress’ help, Huo Yuhao’s understanding of Ultimate Ice kept deepening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was not to say that the Ice Empress didn’t advise him in the past. However, the Ice Empress and Snow Empress were different. Although the Ice Empress had turned into Huo Yuhao’s martial soul, she was still a soul beast, and the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. An Ice Jade Scorpion’s cultivation, understanding, and control of ice elements were very different from humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Icesky Snow Lady, the Snow Empress was a living spirit birthed from the essence of heaven and earth, even though she was categorized as a soul beast. She looked very similar to humans. This was why Huo Yuhao found it easier to implement her advice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress kept on emphasizing that Huo Yuhao was very reliant on his Spirit Eyes. Right now, his Spirit Eyes had grown to a certain standard, and his soul core had already been formed. If he wanted to improve further, the amount of effort that he needed to use was going to be many times higher. His Ultimate Ice martial soul hadn’t been completely tapped yet. This was why he needed to improve his second martial soul if he really wanted to increase his abilities. It was even more essential for him to understand his own martial soul and the ice element.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like the Snow Empress had said, it was much easier for him to understand the mysteries of ice in the core region of the Extreme North than in other places.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao relaxed his body and circulated his Mysterious Heaven Technique. He switched to his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. Naturally, his Mysterious Heaven Technique turned into a cold current that flowed through his body. Although his Spirit Eyes were shut, his immense spiritual control was still there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t cultivate directly. Rather, he tried his best to relax and silently sense the ice around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice was the solid state of water. Water nourished all living beings, and was the origin of life. However, ice could complete life. To some extent, water and ice weren’t just related by temperature. They represented the changes between life and death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was silently sensing things around him and understanding them. He was very invested in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Snow Empress stood beside him and shut her beautiful eyes. She was also silently sensing. What she sensed were Huo Yuhao’s emotions, and the changes in his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked very calm and peaceful as she stood there. There was a slight smile on her face. She didn’t look as cold as she used to be. She looked like a wife trying to protect her lover.</span></p>
