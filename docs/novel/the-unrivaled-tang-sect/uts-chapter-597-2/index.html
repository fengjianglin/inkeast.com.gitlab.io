 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Vicious!” Even Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but be impressed. Women were much more powerful when they bickered with one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, Ju Zi’s aura became a little unbalanced after hearing Tang Wutong’s words. She glared at her fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, we’ll proceed with the detailed plan once we reach Radiant City. Since you’re going to place me within your Fire Phoenix Soul Engineer Legion, do it quickly. We’ll be nearby. I’ll use my Spiritual Detection to communicate with you. One day later, I’ll come find you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay.” Ju Zi nodded obediently. She also changed her expression very quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong silently disappeared. Ju Zi remained seated in the sedan, and everything returned to normal very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She shut her eyes and quietly thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it came to this matter, they had to succeed. Ju Zi knew what she lacked. She lacked someone powerful beside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Undoubtedly, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s arrival had changed this. From how Huo Yuhao had defeated Zhong Liwu, it showed that he possessed the ability to kill Xu Tianran. This was even more plausible since he was very skilled at concealment. When it came to this, even an Ultimate Douluo couldn’t compare to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why she had to succeed this time, no matter what. If they missed out on this opportunity, it would be almost impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she thought until here, Ju Zi started to think of a detailed plan. She had a series of plans she wanted to complete. Many details still had to be perfected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After exiting the sedan, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong silently rose into the sky before they carefully maintained their distance from the Sun Moon Empire army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph! She’s bad!” Tang Wutong commented furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing how furious she was, Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but comfort her, “Don’t be angry. She’s actually having it very hard. She’s a woman, but she’s under so much pressure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you feel that much pity for her?” Tang Wutong smiled as she looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao instantly shut his mouth. It was not a good idea to piss Tang Wutong off at such a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s smile slowly turned into a heavy look. After this, she leaped into Huo Yuhao’s embrace and tightly hugged him around his waist. “I’m sorry, I don’t know why I’m acting like a child. However, I can’t help it. The others are fine. Are there really a lack of girls who like you? Don’t think I don’t know. Ye Guyi and Nan Qiuqiu actually fancy you. However, for some reason, I don’t think they pose any threat. Only Ju Zi is different. I feel that her relationship with you is a little unclear. If not for the fact that I fully trust you, I might think that her child has something to do with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, “Don’t spout nonsense. How can that be possible? I’m still a, still a…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Tang Wutong looked very innocent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao snapped, “Let’s not talk about it. Whatever it is, I’m the same as you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can it be the same? You’re a man, but I’m a woman. How can we possibly be the same?” Tang Wutong was already fully grinning by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really want to know?” Huo Yuhao lowered his head and looked at her seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was intelligent. Before Huo Yuhao could make a move, she immediately jumped out of his embrace and turned around before fleeing. “No, I don’t want to know!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Too late!” Huo Yuhao screamed before he pursued her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They chased after each other in the sky just like that. The earlier unhappiness also gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sun Moon Empire. Radiant City. Imperial Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang!” Xu Tianran slammed the letter in his hand on the table. His servants immediately kneeled down. They were all shaking. They were afraid that he would vent his anger on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past few days, many servants had incurred his wrath, and paid the price of death as a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bastards! Is the Holy Ghost Church intent on revolting?” Xu Tianran’s aura had turned unstable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long ago, he had pondered Ju Zi’s Sin of Memorandum for some time before he responded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Ghost Church shared a tense relationship with the army. That was something that had been true for some time. However, Xu Tianran was a little doubtful that the Holy Ghost Church would attack and loot from the army. At least, it wasn’t an agenda that was in the best interests of the Holy Ghost Church.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the truth was displayed in front of him. Two beast lord-ranked soul engineer legions had suffered heavy losses. From the evidence, everything pointed to the evil soul masters from the Holy Ghost Church. This led to an intense reaction from the army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu had disappeared to some unknown place after his fight with Huo Yuhao. He didn’t have an opportunity to explain. After that, the army started a mutiny. Many lower to mid-tier evil soul masters from the Holy Ghost Church were killed. Only the Titled Douluo managed to escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This intensified the conflict, and Ye Xishui personally came to look for Xu Tianran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran expressed his intention to investigate this matter thoroughly. However, how was he supposed to do that? Although he was the Emperor, he wasn’t the only one calling the shots in the empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among those who died, there was someone very important. It was the legion commander of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion, who represented the interests of the members of the imperial family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His death was also accompanied by the loss of many high-tier stationary soul cannon shells that the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion had accumulated for years. Almost all of them were gone. How much did that cost?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The imperial family was the pillar of the empire, and the leaders of the nobles. Their interests were too important. Even though Xu Tianran wielded great power, he couldn’t ignore them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The losses suffered by the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion almost drove the members of the imperial family crazy. Xu Tianran was also under a lot of pressure. The War God Empress was also highly protected by these members of the imperial family. From different avenues, they managed to find out what was happening at the front line. They were very satisfied with Ju Zi’s protection of her soul engineers. It was important to know that the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion was responsible for killing the most evil soul masters from the Holy Ghost Church when the mutiny occurred!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pressure from both sides was focused on Xu Tianran. His decision was obvious. The Holy Ghost Church was becoming less and less of an asset. He couldn’t shake the empire’s foundations because of them. This was not to even mention that Ju Zi was his most trusted aide, who also contributed greatly to the empire. The Heavenly Soul Empire was now part of the Sun Moon Empire. Without any backend disturbance, the Dou Ling and Star Luo Empires would suffer the same fate very soon. Xu Tianran wasn’t worried about this at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the resources of the Heavenly Soul Empire, the Sun Moon Empire developed even more smoothly. Ju Zi also had a deep hatred for the Star Luo Empire. She was intent on attacking them. She had arranged them to be the last not because her hate for them had dissipated, but because she wanted to deal with them when the Sun Moon Empire was at its strongest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, Xu Tianran wrote a memorandum to admonish her heavily. When she returned to the empire, she would be punished. However, this didn’t have any real meaning. When it came to this matter, it was obvious that Xu Tianran no longer gave the Holy Ghost Church any face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this couldn’t be helped either. If he cared too much about the Holy Ghost Church, what would happen to his own soul engineers? What would happen to the imperial family? What about the nobles?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil soul masters from the Holy Ghost Church were ostracized. This was a good opportunity to slowly make them less powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ye Xishui left, Xu Tianran did consider that the Holy Ghost Church would take revenge. However, the Holy Ghost Church had also developed very quickly over these years because of the Sun Moon Empire’s support. Some of their soul masters with flawed martial souls or with martial souls that were likely to mutate were taken under the wing of the Holy Ghost Church and trained using the methods of evil soul masters. The Holy Ghost Church’s headquarters was also in the Sun Moon Empire. No matter how displeased the Holy Ghost Church was, they couldn’t possibly ignore their own foundation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it seemed like Xu Tianran had underestimated how evil these soul masters were. A thousand soul engineers, killed just like that! All their resources had also been looted. Apart from those from the Holy Ghost Church, who could have done this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bone Dragon? Despicable Bone Dragon. Zhong Liwu, you didn’t return to carry out your duties, but you killed my army. Very good, very good!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sinister smile surfaced on Xu Tianran’s face. No matter how cruel he was, he still had to empathize with his soldiers’ feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His soldiers had killed many enemies at the front line. While not many of them died at their enemies’ hands, many of them were killed by those on the same side. If he looked at this from another perspective, he couldn’t possibly tolerate this incident if he were a general.</span></p>

He also had an impression of the names of those who had written the letters.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How pressed must they be to write such letters? Ju Zi’s letter is at the bottom of the pile. It’s evident that she is under a lot of pressure.</span></p>

Ju Zi had reported to him that the morale of her soldiers was very low. They also hated the Holy Ghost Church to the core. They couldn’t take it anymore, and wanted an explanation. To prevent any further mutiny, she had no choice but to accede to their request. She led the entire army to the border and was planning to station them near the Ming Dou Mountain Range. On the one hand, she was trying to strike fear in the heart of the Star Luo Empire. On the other hand, she wanted to quickly bring the generals back into Radiant City to receive further instructions.</span></p>
