 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui drifted in mid-air and revealed a scornful look on her face. There were still ten blood souls surrounding her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The avenging spirits of two Class 9 soul engineers. Great stuff! However, soul engineers will only be soul engineers. The strength of their souls is still far from a true Titled Douluo. It’s a pity.” As she spoke, she shook her head and sighed. The soul engineers watching her were furious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui coldly looked at Xu Tianran, “Continue attacking if you want to kill me. I’ll see how much you’re willing to sacrifice. It’s a pity that you might not succeed.” As she spoke, she started to descend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She pressed her palm against the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strong bloody lights spread along the ground. Deafening booms started to echo throughout the entire imperial palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran and Kong Deming’s expressions changed. They knew what Ye Xishui wanted. She couldn’t overcome their aerial defense, and thus it was impossible for her to escape. However, even compression array soul tools couldn’t cover the ground. Although the ground defenses in the palace were still very impressive, they weren’t good enough. At least, they weren’t good enough to stop an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground shook. The ground beneath Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong also shook at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were no longer in the store. They were on the streets. Just like many civilians, they saw the rainbow glow in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the civilians didn’t know what was happening. To them, it was very common for something like this to happen in the Sun Moon Empire. Soul tool technology was very widespread here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brow. From his perspective high up in the sky, he could see many things. However, his spiritual power couldn’t enter the barrier formed by the compression array soul tools. He could only see what was going on inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the ground shook, he could roughly guess what Ye Xishui was doing. Yes, the ground might be her only route of escape. But had Xu Tianran really not prepared for this? It wasn’t impossible to unleash a protective soul barrier underground, although it wasted a lot of time. Furthermore, it would be very difficult to control. Could it resist an Ultimate Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong turned her head to look at Huo Yuhao. She asked, “Who do you hope will win this fight?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;“Xu Tianran.” Huo Yuhao answered without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was astonished. “Aren’t you sympathetic of Elder Ye after listening to Long Xiaoyao’s story earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am,” Huo Yuhao replied, “but I’ll still wish for Ye Xishui to be killed. There’s no room for negotiation. Can you imagine it? What would happen if an enraged, evil Ultimate Douluo escapes? Even though I don’t like the Sun Moon Empire, I don’t wish to see any innocent civilians killed. That’s why Ye Xishui must die. If she really escapes, we must risk everything to kill her. Even though we’ll incur Elder Long’s wrath, we have to do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was very hard-headed with his words. He didn’t hesitate at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong nodded silently and said, “The fight has been going on for some time. Why hasn’t anyone from the Holy Ghost Church come to assist Ye Xishui? Are they really so scared of death?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head and said, “No. This must be Ye Xishui’s arrangement. It’s easier for one person to escape. If the Holy Ghost Church is here, can they resist four soul engineer legions? They’ll only send themselves to die. The Holy Ghost Church has suffered heavy losses recently. Ye Xishui must have had told them to leave first before she entered the palace herself. It’s a pity. Up until now, we still don’t know where their headquarters are. Otherwise, we could find many opportunities to make our move if we went over there now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, a beam of black light suddenly landed in front of Huo Yuhao. He raised his hand at grabbed at that beam of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a black piece of paper, with words in some kind of white pigment. When he saw the words on it, Huo Yuhao was astonished. He immediately held Tang Wutong’s hand and turned around before leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the palace, the ground only stopped shaking after a minute or so. A huge depression more than a hundred meters deep had appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was hollow beneath the palace. When Ye Xishui used her palm strike, an entire cave was immediately formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui jumped down without any hesitation. Because of this, she paid the price of two blood souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though there might be traps underground, the geography underground was confusing. She only had a chance to escape if she exploited this confusion. This was why she had to face any arrangements Xu Tianran had made underground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran sighed and softly shook his head after Ye Xishui escaped underground. After this, a sly smile surfaced on his face. As he waved, the rainbow glow in the sky suddenly scattered. Immediately, he flew towards the sky with Ju Zi. It wasn’t just him. Kong Deming, the Class 9 soul engineers and the four soul engineer legions all rose up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A black figure appeared in the sky. It jumped into the palace without any hesitation. A low-pitched dragon roar sounded immediately after this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran clearly noticed this black figure, but he didn’t stop anyone from letting the figure enter. Instead, a wider smile surfaced on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rainbow glow shone once again. The four high-energy compression array soul tools unleashed stronger beams of light compared to before. This time, even the underground of the palace was covered in a rainbow glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boom---” A boom resonated underground. A beam of light lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Xishui was flung into the air by this beam of light. She didn’t manage to escape after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran laughed, “Ye Xishui, you must not have expected this. I sacrificed my palace to deal with you. I’m clearly aware of the price to pay to kill you. I drained you to force you to take risks. Otherwise, what if you had some other special ability? That’s why this will be your grave. You must not have guessed the true purpose of my four compression array soul tools. They are going to be your coffin. This is to protect Radiant City, and prevent the collapse of the palace from affecting anything in the city. It’s just that I didn’t expect Long Xiaoyao to be so attached to you. This is the best ending. Goodbye, Death God Douluo. Go and find your Death God and the Dragon God Douluo. This is great.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Xu Tianran pressed a button at the bottom of his staff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire palace shook a little. Following this, an orange-red glow was unleashed from underground. This glow was very weak at the start. It only appeared from the slits. However, the slits soon became bigger and bigger. The glow also became bigger and bigger. The orange-red glow and the rainbow glow of the compression array soul tools intersected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Slight quaking sounds rumbled. It was important to know that this was even after there were compression array soul tools to protect the city. How terrifying must the quaking be to generate this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong weren’t even out of Radiant City yet, but they turned around at almost the same time. What they saw was only a huge orange-red ball light rising from the imperial palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao instantly turned pale. “Vicious. Xu Tianran is really vicious. He used his palace to deal with the Death God Douluo. I wonder how Elder Long is. Let’s go back.” Huo Yuhao pulled Tang Wutong and ran back without any hesitation. Long Xiaoyao’s condition was unknown, but Ye Xishui was definitely doomed. This was Xu Tianran’s killing blow. He must have been very confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Huo Yuhao’s train of thought was completely clear. He finally understood how Xu Tianran had managed to trick Ye Xishui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The imperial palace was a complete trap. Class 9 stationary soul cannon shells must have had been installed inside the palace. As for how many of them there were, he was unsure. However, there was definitely more than one or two if they wanted to kill an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the start until the end, the compression array soul tools were a bluff. Ye Xishui’s attention was drawn to what they were capable of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were indeed very strong. However, they were almost invincible when it came to defending. When they were used to attack, it did seem that they were still rather flawed. However, Xu Tianran used them to defend! At the same time, the explosion was made even more destructive as it was confined. The Death God Douluo was most certainly dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No wonder he had such a strong sense of crisis when he got close to the imperial palace. If he and Tang Wutong were in the palace, they would have been doomed too! Even if they could escape in time, they would still be encircled by the Sun Moon Empire. This proved that his senses were very accurate. Not entering the palace saved both him and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The orange-red glow was getting stronger and stronger. Even the glow from the Sun couldn’t compare to it. If one watched from above, he would notice that there was an extra sun at the core of Radiant City. It was a sun that was flashing with an intense red glow. This sun was dazzling, but it was filled with death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran had already flown up high. Even though his plan was foolproof, and the soul tools were capable of withstanding the explosion, he still flew up high. There was no harm for him to be cautious, and this was something he did very well.</span></p>
