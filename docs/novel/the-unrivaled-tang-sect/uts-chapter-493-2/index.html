 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The iciness on Xu Tianran’s face mostly vanished after he heard the doctor’s words. He felt as if an enormous burden had been lifted from his chest as he muttered under his breath, “I’m sorry, Ju Zi, I was overthinking. I will treat you well as long as you don’t betray me.” He then said to the man kneeling on the floor, “You may go, royal physician, and take care of the Empress. Make sure this goes well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” the royal physician said respectfully. “Rest assured, Your Majesty, I have checked the Empress’ body many times. She is very healthy, and today is the most opportune time for her to become pregnant. I am more than ninety percent confident that I can help the Empress get pregnant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The royal physician was just speaking his mind honestly, but he was completely unaware that his last sentence sounded vaguely ambiguous, and Xu Tianran’s eyes flickered murderously in response. Of course, from the beginning to the end, he was never going to let anybody who had anything to do with this live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go. Once it’s complete, I will reward you heavily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was also in a silent room. She was lying down on a bed, covered only by a clean white gown. Her eyes were very calm, but there was a dash of cold deep within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran, Xu Tianran, Xu Tianran!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi repeated that name continuously in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran, I haven’t misjudged you after all. I have been so loyal to you, but you treat me like this. Good, very good! It’s a pity that no matter how intelligent you are, you are clueless that I have already been prepared for all this. How could I bear a child for a stranger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The royal physician’s warm voice came to her. “Are you ready, Empress? You might feel some pain in a while.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, royal physician. You may begin,” Ju Zi answered plainly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, then. Please give me the seed that you have prepared,” the royal physician spoke respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi lifted her hand, and a small metal tube appeared in the center of her palm as she slowly passed it to the physician. There was a tinge of tenderness on her facial expression at this moment, and the name of Xu Tianran gradually disappeared from her mind, while another name took its place…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">High up in the night sky...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four thousand five hundred meters up, Huo Yuhao was hovering silently in midair; he had already appeared once more above the Sun Moon Empire’s army camp. He made sure he was as vigilant as he could be while he quietly observed the army camp beneath him. At the same time, he tried to sense whatever dangers could appear at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four thousand five hundred meters. I wonder if the Sun Moon Empire’s ground-based aerial surveillance soul tools can still discover me.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted a little as he bided his time quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several minutes quickly passed, but nothing was happening beneath him. The red light that he had encountered the previous night didn’t appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint smile gradually appeared at the corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes gazed at something faintly discernible in the distance; a cloud that was drifting through the air. He maintained his original position, quietly awaiting something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a ball of black mist descended from the sky without warning and blanketed his position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao looked a little shocked as he immediately dispelled his Imitation and revealed himself in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tsk, tsk! I thought, which other powerful soul master could it be? But you’re just a little kid. You’re just a Soul Sage, and you dare to spy on the Sun Moon Empire’s army camp?” A hoarse voice that wasn’t pleasing to the ear could be heard. Two black shadows suddenly appeared fifty meters away from Huo Yuhao as the cloud that he was staring at disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clouds of black mist bore down on him in a circle from all directions and surrounded Huo Yuhao, while the two black shadows stared at him alertly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two yellow, two purple, and five black soul rings glowed on the person who was speaking. The other black shadow, who didn’t make a sound, had an even stronger combination of soul rings. He had one yellow, three purple, and five black soul rings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were both Titled Douluo. Furthermore, the auras emanating from their bodies felt very sinister and evil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Evil soul masters?” Huo Yuhao exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kid, don’t you think it’s a little too late for you to realize that?” The man in black who spoke before drifted towards Huo Yuhao as he spoke. A bluish-black light gradually grew larger behind him. This bluish-black light shadow looked incredibly terrifying. In the beginning, it looked like a skull, but Huo Yuhao could only see after it swelled that it was a pale human face. He couldn’t even tell if this face was male or female, because were countless disgusting bluish-black maggots crawling all over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other man in black didn’t make a sound from the beginning to the end. Light glowed from behind him as well, but this light was dark green, and condensed into an enormous centipede with a single eye on its forehead swaying gently in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s face was completely pale.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wow, two evil Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Titled Douluo were frightening individuals comparable to Transcendent Douluo in the world of soul masters! Huo Yuhao seemed to tremble in fright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s too late to be afraid. The two of us wouldn’t have had to make this trip if we didn’t have to capture you alive. Alright, kid, follow us down. Otherwise, I’ll let you have a taste of my Avenging Spirit Mask. I’ll let it consume your spirit bit by bit, and that feeling, tsk, tsk…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Avenging Spirit Mask. This was the first time Huo Yuhao had heard of a martial soul like that. It seemed like a mutated martial soul, and it was definitely an evil martial soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Two seniors, I’m just a scout responsible for collecting intelligence. Why do you have to cause trouble for me?” Huo Yuhao forced a laugh as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahahaha! Kid, you don’t have to insult us with words. Are you going to let us capture you without resisting, or do we have to make a move on you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gritted his teeth and said, “I can let you capture me, but can I know your titles? At least, I will know whose hands I’ve fallen into.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil soul master who possessed the Avenging Spirit Mask said, “There’s no harm in telling you. I am the Masquerade Douluo, and this is the Heavenly Centipede Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t expect us to meet again. You’re a spy after all.” A familiar voice could be heard, and it came from the Heavenly Centipede Douluo, who hadn’t spoken at all until this point. He suddenly lifted the black veil that was covering his face and revealed himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s expression changed a little when he saw him, because he knew this evil soul master. He was the Duskwater Alliance Master, and he seemed to be the Holy Ghost Church’s Second Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had always been careful, and that was the reason why he would always change his appearance even when he was conducting aerial surveillance. However, the look that he had chosen to take on was the same as the identity he had used to participate in the Radiant City Elite Soul Engineering Tournament, Tang Wu. He was immediately recognized by Nangong Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We finally meet again, Alliance Master Nangong,” Huo Yuhao replied, but his expression seemed a lot calmer than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wan gritted his teeth when he saw Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had helped the Duskwater Alliance eventually win the championship during the Radiant City Elite Soul Engineering Tournament, and took away all his prizes. Nangong Wan was prepared to take him in as his disciple back then, but because Huo Yuhao’s performance was far too outstanding, and especially because of his necromancy, even the Holy Ghost Church’s vice-leader paid attention to him. She believed that he was the Holy Ghost Church’s Holy Son, who had yet to appear in this world. But who knew that Huo Yuhao would immediately disappear after the competition, and take away countless rare metals, the Sunmoon Divine Needle, and a Class 9 stationary soul cannon shell, the Annihilation Storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sunmoon Divine Needle was still alright, as the Starsky Douluo, Ye Yulin had taken that out. However, it wasn’t easy for the Holy Ghost Church to obtain Annihilation Storm, and the original intent was for it to urge soul engineers to put effort into the competition. But Huo Yuhao had vanished into thin air during the mess of that enormous explosion, without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the aftermath of the great explosion, Nangong Wan had tried hard to find him, but how could he find Tang Wu? Now that he had met Huo Yuhao once more today, Nangong Wan could tell from where he had appeared that he was a spy. Furthermore, he was the Heavenly Soul Empire’s spy. How could he not be angry?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The vice-leader had berated him for not being able to find Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it’s been a long time. Should I call you Tang Wu, or by another name?” Nangong Wan said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled plainly and said, “You can just call me Tang Wu.” Of course, he wouldn’t be so foolish as to reveal his identity. Furthermore, he wasn’t just a soul engineer when he met Nangong Wan back then. He had also presented himself as a necromancer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, Tang Wu. I want to see how you can run away this time!” Nangong Wan said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grinned and said, “Run? Why would I run? The two of you are the ones who shouldn’t run away later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” The Masquerade Douluo and the Heavenly Centipede Douluo were momentarily stunned as a green shadow bolted towards them like a ghost from far away. It took but a few blinks of the eye for her to arrive beside Huo Yuhao. Wasn’t it the Greenshadow Douluo, Elder Song?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had departed at the same time as Elder Song, but they didn’t travel together. Huo Yuhao was attracting the attention of the ground-based aerial surveillance soul tools from four thousand five hundred meters up in the sky, while Elder Song watched him from six thousand meters. Six thousand meters was the limit that humans could reach, and nobody but Transcendent Douluo could reach that altitude. The Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools couldn’t possibly reach that height.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao didn’t expect to encounter two evil Titled Douluo who wanted to capture him alive. This was an unexpected but pleasant surprise. If he could capture a Titled Douluo, it would be a lot easier for him to discover Tang Ya’s location!</span></p>
