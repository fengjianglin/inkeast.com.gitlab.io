This was a new term to the Shrek students. Huo Yuhao was also very curious. Was this soul tool supposed to scan their bodies and display what abilities they possessed? Although they were guessing in their hearts, they followed Lin Jiayi’s instructions and put their soul tools away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou looked at Huo Yuhao and asked, “Little junior, will we be harmed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head lightly. If the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy wanted to deal with them, they didn’t have to go through so much trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which student is going first?” Lin Jiayi asked as he saw the group of Shrek students quickly putting their things away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me go first.” Ye Xiaosheng volunteered by raising his hand. He turned back to look at the other students and nodded at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Initially, Huo Yuhao didn’t have a good impression of this Brother Sheng. However, he didn’t seem to be stealing the limelight by volunteering to go first. As a stranger in an unfamiliar place, his courage earned Huo Yuhao’s respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A teacher led Ye Xiaosheng to a measuring scale and said, “Don’t be nervous and relax your body. There will be a beam of light scanning your body from the top down. The entire process won’t harm you. It’ll only record your body condition, as well as your height and weight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay.” Ye Xiaosheng acknowledged readily, and didn’t speak any further.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The rest of the students focused their attention on him. They were both curious and nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This measuring scale was a tall, circular pillar. A crystal beam extended from top to bottom of the front of the scale. The pillar was about three meters tall, with a circular platform in the front of it. Ye Xiaosheng faced the crystal beam as requested by the teacher.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The teacher walked in front of the measuring scale and pressed his hand against a palm outline depression on the side of the pillar. At the same time, another teacher walked to the other side. He was holding a book and pen for recording purposes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Relax. It’s about to start,” that teacher said. Everyone felt a wave of soul power coming from his body. It was the most obvious around his arm, where they could clearly see a white glow flashing. Following that, the top of the measuring scale lit up with a fan of white light, covering around a square meter. It descended slowly from the top of the pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Xiaosheng couldn’t possibly not be nervous. But he still tried to relax at this point. When he saw the white light descending, he stiffened up, and didn’t move in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jiayi nodded as he watched from one side. He indeed lived up to the name of a Shrek student. He wasn’t even a little afraid as he was scanned by a soul tool from Shrek’s rival academy. His courage was indeed commendable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The white light slowly moved from his head down as it scanned Ye Xiaosheng.. It took some time before the light reached his chest. The teacher on the other side had already started recording, and reported the results.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Physical strength – Rank 54. Physical tenacity – Rank 61. Soul power undulation – Rank 62. Height- 1.82 meters. Weight – 81 kilograms. Left arm length… no added soul bones. Evaluation: Soul Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ranks referred to in this measurement were related to one’s soul power. In Ye Xiaosheng’s case, he was a Rank 62 soul emperor who had a physical strength that corresponded to a Rank 54 soul king, and a physical tenacity that corresponded to a Rank 61 soul emperor. However, only the Sun Moon Empire knew their own evaluation standards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Throughout the entire scanning process, the teacher that was responsible for recording actually reported more than 30 statistics related to Ye Xiaosheng’s body. Ye Xiaosheng was shocked. Evidently, the statistics accurately revealed his body condition. He felt as if he had been stripped and measured at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was equally shocked. This soul tool was actually so capable? This was too scary. Did this mean that his own hidden abilities would be exposed? In terms of physical strength, he was far superior to the others! What should he do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao furrowed his brows as he stood there. He didn’t know what to do. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s advances in the area of soul tools might thwart their plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou thought of the same problem and turned around to look at Huo Yuhao. He asked Huo Yuhao how they should proceed using his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Xiaosheng’s body measurements had been completed and recorded. Lin Jiayi gestured for the next student to take their measurements.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It would take around a minute to scan each student. Although Huo Yuhao and He Caitou were at the back, they didn’t have much time to think.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could he use Imitation to imitate the body condition of someone else? This was the first possibility that Huo Yuhao thought of. However, he refuted that possibility almost immediately. That’s because he couldn’t possibly imitate someone else’s entire body. He couldn’t possibly change himself to become the other person. He would be exposed that way. Furthermore, there would be soul power undulations if he used his soul skill. The measuring scale was so advanced; how could it not tell?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou looked at Huo Yuhao anxiously as he started to perspire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao touched his arm lightly and said softly, “Second senior, it’ll be fine. We’ll find a way out. It’s fine if they find out. Let’s take it step by step. Since they’re not going to let me remain low-profile, then…” As he spoke till here, he squinted his eyes, and a cold light flashed across them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The students took their measurements one by one. Lin Jiayi’s expression also started to turn serious. The students that Shrek had sent over were indeed superior to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s students in terms of their physical strength. Even the Illustrious Virtue Hall’s disciples couldn’t compare. It was important to note that they were Shrek Academy’s Soul Tool Department students! Their bodies were already so strong! Just how strong were the Martial Soul Department students?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jiayi sighed in his heart. Shrek Academy indeed lived up to its name as the top academy on the continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wow, this student is huge.” Lin Jiayi’s eyes brightened up as he watched the next student that walked up to the soul physique measuring scale. This student was the ninth one. His complexion resembled the members of the Sun Moon Empire’s nobility!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou’s tanned skin caught Lin Jiayi’s attention. Although not all members of the Sun Moon Empire’s nobility possessed a tanned complexion, almost all the subjects of the Sun Moon Empire with a tanned complexion were members of the Sun Moon Empire’s nobility. That was why a dark skin color was the most elegant in the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He Caitou was now more than two meters tall. When the light from the measuring scale scanned him, the voice of the teacher recording the results reached a higher pitch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Physical strength – Rank 70! Physical tenacity – Rank 64. Soul power – Rank 51…” As he spoke till here, the teacher lifted his head to look at He Caitou. He was a Rank 51 soul king, but his body was as strong as a seven-ringed soul sage? Although a soul master’s strength was not as important as his soul power, it was still very important for a soul engineer to possess a strong body. This would at least give him the ability to carry heavier soul tools. When using offensive soul tools, he would also be able to bear the recoil better than other soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Jiayi’s pupils shrank. Was this guy a freak? Where did Shrek Academy find this guy? From his statistics, it seemed as if he was custom-made to be a soul engineer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Age – 17. Height – 2.02 meters. Weight- 110 kilograms. Added soul bone and skeleton. Little fellow, you’re like the human form of a soul beast!” The teacher doing the recording exclaimed. It wasn’t his first day doing such tasks, but it was his first time seeing someone He Caitou’s age possessing such a great physical condition. He possessed the powers of a soul king, but the other aspects of his body were at least at the level of a soul emperor. It was extremely shocking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only were the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s teachers shocked, but even the Shrek Academy students were stunned as they all looked at He Caitou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They wouldn’t be so shocked if He Caitou was an inner courtyard disciple. But they were clearly aware that he was Teacher Fan Yu’s inheriting disciple! He was a seventeen-year-old soul king, and clearly had the ability to enter the inner courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Xiaosheng’s expression changed drastically. His eyes flashed a little as he looked at He Caitou. He seemed to be thinking of something.</span></p>
