 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am really sorry. I didn’t want it to end like this. We really did not come with any bad intentions.” Huo Yuhao tried his best to explain to the mermaid with the crown. Even though he did not know exactly was her status amongst the Merfolk was, he believed that she was probably a mermaid with a decent status, considering how she had already cultivated for a hundred thousand years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid showed no sign of forgiveness as she glared back at him with hateful eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed after seeing how his friendly gesture was not reciprocated by the mermaid. He knew it was probably impossible to reverse her attitude towards humans. Even though he didn't know why the mermaid hated humans so much, he couldn't care less, as all he wanted to do now was bring Tang Wutong to safety. He was not so naive to believe that he could solve the sour mermaid-human relationship by himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Huo Yuhao sensed that something was wrong. His senses were particularly acute because his Eye of Destiny had been open all this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The speed at which the ice ball was ascending suddenly decreased, as the small amount of light that was starting to show in the ocean disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shit!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately, Huo Yuhao hugged the mermaid tighter as his heart sank. He knew it was impossible for him to kill his hostage. If he were to kill her, the rest of the soul beasts would never let him leave. Right now, he could sense the transformations within the water. However, he was unable to pinpoint where exactly they were coming from. If he was unable to detect the source of the transformations, it suggested how powerful his opponent was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mermaid was blushing, yet angry at the same time. It was her first time being so close to a person of the opposite gender. She had never gotten so close to a male aquatic soul beast, much less a human male.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This human's aura is exceptionally strong. His spiritual power is especially powerful. He is probably the human with the strongest spiritual power I’ve ever met.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In her eyes, Huo Yuhao also had a very different scent. He did not have the same ocean smell that her peers possessed, and this was something that was quite refreshing to her. Huo Yuhao placed one of his hands around her waist as he wrapped the other hand around her neck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao did not know that the most sensitive region on a mermaid's body was their neck. If he were to release his hands right now, he would realize how the mermaid's neck was flushing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Human, there is no way you can escape."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mysterious energy suddenly appeared as Huo Yuhao watched the mermaid in his arms dissolve into bubbles and disappear. Following which, it seemed as though this entire region's space was sealed as all water currents stopped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An invincible pressure started to act on him from all directions. Huo Yuhao had been barely sustaining himself on his internal breathing, and his face grew pale after feeling the increase in pressure. He suddenly felt the possibility of his impending death. He knew he could not hold on much longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bright blue light could suddenly be seen in the middle of the seawater. It was a pillar of light which came from the bottom of the sea. It shot towards Huo Yuhao and stopped at a region approximately three hundred meters away from him and Tang Wutong. Following which, two figures appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of them happened to be the same mermaid with the crown. The other mermaid happened to be one which they had not seen before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This new mermaid looked very peculiar. Its size and figure was pretty similar to that of the one which wore the crown. However, her crown was golden. In fact, even the scales on her fishtail were golden. The immense pressure that was acting on Huo Yuhao came from this mermaid, which looked like a beautiful middle-aged woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If their battleground was not in the ocean and Huo Yuhao was able to team up with Tang Wutong, he might have stood a chance against them. However, he was deep in the sea in his opponents' home ground. There was almost no chance that he would be able to escape today. And that was because he had already recognized the mermaid's identity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only one possible person in the entire sea who could possess such incredible power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Greetings, Your Highness!" Even though Huo Yuhao might not be able to move, he could still send his greetings through his spiritual intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Human, why did you come to our homeland? Do you still want to pollute our Sea? You have already harmed so many of our people. Is it still not enough for you?" The Princess of the Sea's voice might be threatening, but she did not immediately attack Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gave her an awkward smile. “ I am sorry, Your Highness. I am really not aware of what my fellow humans have done to the Merfolk. I can only vouch for myself and my partner that we come in peace. The reason why we are here is that we hope to discuss something with you. If you are willing to give me a chance to speak, I will gladly allow myself to be captured and share with you what we hope to discuss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you are the one who rules this sea, you should naturally know everything that happens in this area. In that case, you should know how both of us did not harm any aquatic soul beasts throughout our entire journey in the Ice Sea. We really don’t have any bad intentions. I believe that there will always be good and bad people in both the human race and among the Merfolk. Even though I don’t think I am a perfect person, I can guarantee that I come in peace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea frowned as she looked at Huo Yuhao. “Do you really think both of you would still be alive if you had harmed my people? Tell me what you are here for. I will give you a chance to persuade me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao let out a sigh of relief. As long as he had a chance to speak, he had a chance to live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the mermaid which was wearing a silver crown interjected, “No Mother, you must not give these despicable humans another chance. Have you forgotten? When they first interacted with us, they seduced us to trust them with their words. And what did they do in the end? If not for them, my sister would not have…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she spoke, she, who was obviously a mermaid princess, started to tear up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was surprised to see how her tears streamed out in a glistening fashion before transforming into white round pearls that floated in the seawater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t cry, my child. Tearing up will only drain your life energy. Don’t worry. I promise you I will make sure they pay for what they have done.” It was apparent that the Princess of the Sea was very doting towards her daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shit!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what she said, Huo Yuhao started to panic. He quickly mustered the soul power in his body as he tried to break free from her control.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Princess of the Sea definitely called the shots in the ocean. Besides, she possessed the ability of an Ultimate Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Princess of the Sea waved her left hand, and the seawater around Huo Yuhao started to contort vigorously, and apply immense pressure on him. It was almost as though the entire sea was her weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao tried to forcefully release his soul power and execute a soul skill, he felt a powerful spiritual energy suppress his spiritual sea and body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was not just a spiritual-type soul skill, but a suppressive attack based purely on spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had been a while since Huo Yuhao had last faced an opponent who had spiritual power that was more powerful than his. The Princess of the Sea’s spiritual power was beyond Huo Yuhao’s imagination. Perhaps only the Evileye Tyrant would be able to beat her in spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not long before the suffocating sensation returned again. Huo Yuhao knew that he could not hold it any longer. It was simply too disadvantageous for him to fight in the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Am I really going to die here? No. No way. I must bring Wutong out. Even if it comes at the expense of my life, I must save her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this situation which concerned Wutong’s life and death, Huo Yuhao’s eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sunray patterns around the Eye of Destiny on his forehead started to shine as its rose gold glow turned the surrounding seawater golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A layer of rose gold light sparkled behind Huo Yuhao’s back as a gigantic eye slowly opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao knew that there was still a slim chance that he might survive the Princess of the Sea’s attack. This was because he still had the Beast God’s seal on him. When he was about to die, Di Tian would definitely think of a way to save him. However, Tang Wutong did not have the same kind of protection. The thick ice that was surrounding her was starting to break under the immense pressure applied by the Princess of the Sea. The pressure would act instantly on her body the moment the ice ball caved in. By then, even if he managed to stay alive, Tang Wutong would die in the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back when she was still Dong’er, she had already left him once. Huo Yuhao had vowed to keep her out of harm’s way and never put her in any form of danger again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the determination in heart grew stronger, Huo Yuhao’s spiritual sea exploded like a geyser. A powerful golden glow expanded into the surroundings from Huo Yuhao’s head. The eye that was behind Huo Yuhao’s back also started to become less illusory. Initially, it seemed to be purely rose gold. But as it became increasingly material, it started to become bronze, then silver, before finally turning golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Du Busi were still alive, he would have recognized this as a symptom of the second awakening of a Body Soul. In fact, a golden awakening meant that it was the highest tier and most powerful transformation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?” The Princess of the Sea was surprised to see how Huo Yuhao was able to put up a fight against her spiritual power.</span></p>
