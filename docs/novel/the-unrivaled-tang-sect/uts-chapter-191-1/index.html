When he saw Huo Yuhao’s calm yet icy-cold eyes, he knew that his roar earlier hadn’t affected him for long. Furthermore, his sense of crisis also rose. Without any hesitation, he used his strongest soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His pitch-black seventh soul ring suddenly lit up. Just as Huo Yuhao’s Spirit Eyes unleashed the Spiritual Shock that had fused with the purplish-gold light of the Purple Demon Eyes, Zhao Yang’s size ballooned once again. He reached almost five meters tall, and bright golden fur covered his entire body. Apart from his face that still remained mostly human, the rest of him turned into a huge bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, this was the change after a soul master obtained seven rings. This was also the divide between an intermediate-level soul master and an advanced-level soul master: Martial Soul True Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a soul master reached a seven-ringed cultivation, his martial soul would change regardless of the age of his soul rings. Their martial souls would truly combine with their bodies, and could now exhibit the Martial Soul True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once their Martial Soul True Body was activated, their entire body would turn into the form of the martial soul, and their powers would soar. The power of their original soul skills could possibly double. After reaching the Soul Sage level, a soul engineer would find it very difficult to defeat a soul master unless he had special soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yang’s martial soul resisted half the effect of the Spiritual Shock. His head only rocked backward slightly, and he regained his awareness after some momentary confusion. Whether it was his body or his spiritual power, they were enhanced greatly along with his martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his palm still struck air because of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Shock. Huo Yuhao wasn’t the only one fighting. A pair of dazzling bluish-gold wings flapped open behind him and pulled him backward. He shifted back by five meters and avoided his opponent’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s gaze was cold, yet calm. This was his first time fighting a Soul Sage and a Martial Soul True Body. It was even a critical moment. However, he wasn’t anxious. Rather, he was excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He cultivated tirelessly so that he could challenge his limits and fight others who were strong. If he were alone, he would never be able to beat a seven-ringed Soul Sage, no matter how strong his twin martial souls were and what soul tools he had. However, he had Wang Dong with him now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shouted, “Get out of the way! Ju Zi, stay back.” As he spoke, his eyes shone with bright golden light. A pair of hands were also wrapped around his waist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another shocking scene appeared once again. The bluish-golden wings folded together in front of him, and the golden light that Huo Yuhao emitted became even brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence was exhibited once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A blue, purple, and gold tri-colored light was converted into a unique ray. This ray of light appeared on a path that Zhao Yang had to cross. Even a Soul Sage couldn’t avoid this attack, as Huo Yuhao had his Spiritual Detection up to pre-empt him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying part of the Golden Road wasn’t its offensive strength, but its ability to seal one’s soul skills.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aren’t you using your Martial Soul True Body? Then I shall seal it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Soul Sage was much weaker without his Martial Soul True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yang’s shining golden body was engulfed by the Golden Road. He only felt a wave of scorching heat circulating through his entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong teamed up to fight Jing Ziyan and Ji Juechen, they didn’t unleash the Golden Road fully. After all, they were only sparring. Right now, Zhao Yang was the first to experience the complete version of the Golden Road after Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’s abilities had increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An astonishing scene was instantly revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhao Yang’s pace dipped considerably, and the golden hair on his body was melting at an alarming speed. The golden light that was shining from his body also became much brighter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath. After this series of battles, he was also greatly spent. However, he had no intention of resting at this point. If Zhao Yang was allowed to unleash his full abilities, everyone on the mountaintop would die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wang Dong, it’s up to you now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After they unleashed the Golden Road, they switched positions. Huo Yuhao pulled Wang Dong’s right hand, and Wang Dong detached from his back. Huo Yuhao lifted his right hand to guide Wang Dong’s movements. Wang Dong performed a remarkable dance move—he made a hundred and eighty degree turn on one foot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong immediately shifted from Huo Yuhao’s backside to his front. Countless streaks of light around their bodies shot out once again.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lights were blinding, and no one dared to look straight at them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time seemed to have stopped at this instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bluish-gold wings started to expand quickly. Instantly, they were already twice their original size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Radiant Butterfly Goddess initially had front and back wings only. However, there was an extra emerald middle wing now. It was smooth, bright, and translucent. A thick aura of life exuded from it, the essence of it composed of light and water. This aura of life complemented the aura of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dazzling butterfly wings opened wide. The tri-colored light seemed to shine with other colors now. There seemed to be countless beads of water on the wings reflecting the light. As the light shone, layers of frosty gas were released from the figure’s feet, accentuating the elegance of her slender figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the frost spread, her surroundings seemed to turn into a world of ice and snow. The icy chill also catalyzed shocking changes in Wang Dong and Huo Yuhao’s fused body. A tall, thin figure appeared in the tri-colored light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a lady, a young lady that seemed to have matured. She was more than one meter and eighty centimeters tall. Her slender figure was also very captivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had long, pinkish-blue hair that flowed all the way down to her legs, but her eyes were bright-gold. Even ‘perfect’ was insufficient to describe her captivating figure. Her ravishing beauty overshadowed all the women present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every streak of light complemented every curve of her body. No one could describe how they felt when they first saw her. However, everyone’s attention was drawn to her the moment she appeared.</span></p>

Every step she took was gentle and perfect. Her captivating looks were filled with the sparkle of life and hope. Her wings were a perfect embellishment. As she soaked in the warmth of the light, she danced to the Raiment of Light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She danced alone within the icy fog as she faced the frightening Violent Goldbear. Her tri-colored wings extended and retracted, underlining her elegance.</span></p>

Her beauty was flawless. Her hair didn’t sway in the wind, and her pinkish-blue eyes carried a gentle light. Her snow-white skin that was immersed in the light appeared very enthralling as it was covered by the pair of dazzling wings behind her.</span></p>
