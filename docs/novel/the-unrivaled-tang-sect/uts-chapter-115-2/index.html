 <p><strong>Book 14: The Finals!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 115.2: The Start of the Final Battle</strong></p>
 <p>Looking at the resolute look in his eyes, Ma Xiaotao could not help but think to herself, “This kid is really cute! No wonder the elders of the Sea God’s Pavilion held a conference for him.” Perhaps Elder Xuan’s appearance was not a coincidence after all.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao stood up and said, “Yuhao, I’m happy because of your attachment to Shrek. But you must remember that things are only possible if you’re alive. You can’t be too stubborn as a person. A great man needs to know when to yield and when not to.”</p>
 <p>After speaking, she glanced at Wang Dong once more before leaving Huo Yuhao’s room.</p>
 <p>Wang Dong followed her to the door and asserted his authority as he closed it.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao said, “Wang Dong, go back and rest first. I’ll find you later.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Are you scared? I actually agree with her words that preserving your life is more important. If the Body Sect abducts you, don’t be stubborn.” Wang Dong said worriedly.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “What’s there to be scared about? Nothing is scary with Elder Xuan around. I’ve never overthought the Body Sect all this while. Who can predict the future? It’s just that I gained some experience and developed some thoughts towards soul tools after seeing the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s performance. I need some time to think things over, but I’ll find you later. Don’t think so much.”</p>
 <p>“This…” Wang Dong was a little angry as he growled, “You’re taking my goodwill as malicious. Go and slowly think.” After he finished, he opened the door and left. He even shut the door quite hard.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao touched his nose and felt as if an unexpected calamity had arrived.</p>
 <p>The Body Sect’s appearance didn’t exactly stir up his feelings much. But as Ma Xiaotao said, there was at least one thing that he doesn’t have to be afraid of no matter what ploy the Body Sect used in the future. The Body Sect wanted to take him in and not hurt him. What was there for him to be afraid of? He was more focused on the start of the finals.</p>
 <p>After witnessing Ma Rulong’s tremendous powers today, he was not confident that they would win! It was also his first time seeing how Ma Rulong was so frightening with his use of soul tools.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s pupils turned golden as he stood up, and 2 of his soul rings quietly appeared. The dim golden color amidst the white was the Skydream Iceworm’s soul ring, while the darker purple soul ring was an imitation of his second soul skill.</p>
 <p>The rise in his capabilities caused the burden on him to increase greatly. The Skydream Iceworm kept on releasing the powers that he had sealed to increase the strength of his soul ring, just like he had mentioned before. The strength of his second soul ring was at about five thousand years right now.</p>
 <p>“It’s a pity there’re only 2 rings.” Huo Yuhao’s clenched his fist. What he needed the most now was the accumulation of time.</p>
 <p>He stripped off his outer wear and sat cross-legged on the bed. He did not meditate, but recalled the performance of Ma Rulong earlier. Along with his own understanding of soul tools, he comprehended that soul tool strategy.</p>
 <p>Star Luo City. As the Star Luo Empire’s capital, it had already been overcrowded for a few days.</p>
 <p>Overcrowding in the city meant that every street was full of people.</p>
 <p>The semifinals of the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament had already ended. After the Semifinals ended, a queue had already formed in Star Luo Plaza. Some even queued for 2 days and 2 nights straight because they wanted to watch the finals of the tournament. This was one thing that they would probably rave about for the rest of their lives.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the finals would be conducted in their entirety in 1 day even, though it was divided into a team round, an individual round and a 2-2-3 fight. This was indeed an exciting event, and it would be worth it to watch it, although they had to endure the suffering now.</p>
 <p>The Star Luo Empire had also deployed 10,000 more elite troops to maintain order in the city. All the shops in the city extended their operating hours too. To accommodate the sudden rise in the city’s population, various types of resources were transferred from surrounding major cities. In an instant, Star Luo City had reached a bustling state never seen before.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, the economic benefits to the Star Luo Empire brought about by the tournament were immeasurable. No wonder many empires competed to host the tournament, but still had to reach a compromise eventually, so that the tournament was held by a different country every time.</p>
 <p>The 2 finalists, Shrek Academy and the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy, represented the strongest powers on the continent. There was an enormous amount of anticipation for the finals.</p>
 <p>However, the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy was odds on to defeat the Shrek Academy on the black market due to Shrek Academy’s weak lineup. They were given a 65% probability to emerge victorious, compared to Shrek Academy’s 35% chance.</p>
 <p>However, no one would believe that Shrek Academy would lose so easily. Even the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy thought so too. After all, Shrek Academy’s students were all filled with potential. No one knew what kind of powers they would display, or whether they had anymore tricks up their sleeves.</p>
 <p>In the previous rounds, they had already dished out surprising performances several times. In the finals, they would definitely give their all to protect Shrek Academy’s glory. It was thus difficult to predict what the result would be.</p>
 <p>Today’s weather was not very good. There were gloomy clouds, and a dim fog even covered Star Luo City. Light drizzles fell occasionally and brought about a sense of chill to this majestic city.</p>
 <p>However, the spectators’ warmth and passion didn’t fall even with the sense of chill that struck the city. The finals of the Continental Elite Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament were about to start. An ultimate battle was about to begin.</p>
 <p>Right now, both teams were on their way to Star Luo Plaza. Troops were deployed along the way to restrain the people who were shouting and screaming their names. Many of those who were unable to gain admission into Star Luo Plaza were gathered at the sides of the street to get a close look at both teams’ members.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen was in the middle of Shrek Academy’s team, and occasionally lifted her head into the sky. Her pretty face rippled with a tinge of happiness. Since she controlled the ice element, this gloomy weather that signified a possibility of rain was undoubtedly very beneficial for her! Moreover, she was also aided by Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Wang Yan had discussed their strategies yesterday and made further adjustments to account for the weather today. Everyone was overly nervous because of the upcoming finals. However, it was inevitable that they would feel like that.</p>
 <p>Shrek Academy wasn’t the only nervous one. The Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s students were even more nervous. This was the closest that their academy had ever been to winning the tournament! They were extremely powerful, while the Shrek Academy team’s lineup was comparatively weaker too. This kind of opportunity only came once in a lifetime. They were more nervous because they were so close to becoming the champions.</p>
 <p>Even the normally arrogant Xiao Hongchen was very tense now. Occasionally, he would take a peek at the Shrek Academy members that graced the red carpet with them today. His competitive streak and hunger were piqued as he watched them.</p>
 <p>Meng Hongchen was much better compared to Xiao Hongchen’s anxiety and buzz. Meng Hongchen’s gaze landed on Wang Dong.</p>
 <p>From the side, Wang Dong’s facial lines were extremely smooth. Although he was still young, his figure was already very slender. Meng Hongchen observed him in a different way from the others.</p>
 <p>She thought to herself as she looked at Wang Dong, “Wow, his eyelashes are really long. Not only are they long, but they’re also raised. They’re so beautiful, and even longer than mine by a lot. His eyes are pinkish-blue, and there’s an indescribable allure about him. He’s 12 years old, 2 years younger than I am. His twin martial soul is also considered…”</p>
 <p>She was already feeling a little hot in her head as she thought till this point. For some reason, she kept thinking of Wang Dong after he had struck up a conversation with her that day. Even Wang Dong was unaware that he had caused her to develop a pure and intense crush on him.</p>
 <p>The red carpet led all the way to the resting area before looping around the arena. On top of the city walls in the distance, the Star Luo Emperor had already led the Star Luo Empire’s officials up. This showed his respect for the two teams that were about to compete.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao was very calm now. Wang Yan had talked to both him and Wang Dong last night for some time before he left. His competitive streak had never been so high before. While his powers were nothing in comparison to the other team members of both academies, things changed quickly in a competition. He wanted to compete, and thirsted for victory. He hoped to further Shrek Academy’s glory with his own hard work.</p>
 <p>He turned his attention to the top of the city wall unintentionally. At first glance, he could already see the Star Luo Emperor, as well as Princess Jiu Jiu on his left.</p>
 <p>Princess Jiu Jiu also saw him, but she didn’t seem too friendly.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, Huo Yuhao’s body suddenly jerked. The composure that he had maintained was suddenly overwhelmed by horror.</p>
 <p>It was a middle-aged man that appeared to be more than 30 years old. He wore golden armor, but no helmet. This revealed his facial features. His eyes were sunken, and his pupils flashed within his blue eyes. He looked a little thin, but he gave off a tough feel. He was charming, resilient, tall and straight, but also bursting with energy as he stood beside the Star Luo Emperor.</p>
 <p>It’s, it’s him…</p>
 <p>How could Huo Yuhao remain calm upon seeing this person?</p>
 <p>Yes, the White Tiger Duke that protected the Star Luo Empire’s western border had returned for the finals. It wasn’t just because this was the finals of the tournament, but also because he wanted to see his eldest son compete.</p>
