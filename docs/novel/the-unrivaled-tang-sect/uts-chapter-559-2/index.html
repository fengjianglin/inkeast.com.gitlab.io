 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Shrek Academy, very few people knew that Huo Yuhao already had a spiritual soul core. But Elder Xuan didn’t hide anything from Yan Shaozhe or Xian Lin’er. After all, they were the future pillars of Shrek Academy, just like Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the past few years, Huo Yuhao had been developing rapidly. He was so fast that he was even close to their generation of soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was now trying for his second soul core? If he managed to successfully do so, he could possibly become the first person in Shrek’s history to possess two soul cores as a Titled Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, he was bound to become a Class 98 Transcendent Douluo in the future. The time he took to do so would also be very short. No bottleneck could possibly stop him at the tier of a Transcendent Douluo. The only thing that could stop him was if he tried to make a breakthrough to Rank 99 from Rank 98. This was because he would need to have three soul cores then, which would be unprecedented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one knew if Huo Yuhao would succeed. However, Xian Lin’er was very aware that he would possess the abilities of a Transcendent Douluo when he formed his second soul core, no matter what rank his soul power was at. Furthermore, he would be a Transcendent Douluo with an Ultimate martial soul. His cultivation might even exceed hers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her anger slowly dissipated. The formation of Huo Yuhao’s second soul core would be extremely significant for Shrek Academy! However, given how chaotic his aura was right now, what if he ran amok?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er furrowed her brow and said, “Yuhao must be trying for his second soul core. However, I’m still a little unsure of his current condition. Watch over him closely. Don’t let anyone get close to him, and don’t disturb him either. When soul masters try for their second soul core, the conditions are bound to be very complex. Things can change instantly. I’ll go and ask Elder Xuan. He’s the only one who has experience in this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er was always very direct and straightforward. After she finished speaking, she left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Forming his second soul core?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou, Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan all looked at one another. Their soul powers were all above Rank 80, but they were still some distance from becoming Titled Douluo. However, they would only need one more soul ring to become a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among Shrek’s Seven Monsters, Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi were currently the closest to Rank 90, followed by He Caitou, Jiang Nannan, and Xiao Xiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Qiankun Fortune Pill indeed had the power of changing fortunes. They had consumed the pill a long time ago, but its effects had not worn out yet. This was why the cultivation speed of everyone from the Tang Sect was slightly faster than ordinary soul masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He Caitou sighed and said, “Yuhao is widening the gap further and further away from us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi also laughed bitterly. “I still remember how I kicked him into the air with one leg when I first met him. However, I was blackmailed by Bei Bei then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Nannan’s face turned red and she said, “How dare you mention it? Blackmailing you was a let off for you. You should have been whacked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi chuckled, “Can you bear to do that? You already had a crush on me then, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, do you have to be so shameless? You still weren’t good enough back then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi said, “I hope little junior is successful. If he succeeds this time, the Tang Sect will really become a lot stronger. Wutong is already a Titled Douluo. If little junior is one too, their fighting strength will only continue to increase when they combine their powers. In my opinion, they might even be stronger than an ordinary Transcendent Douluo. They might even be as strong as an Ultimate Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan came very quickly. Less than ten minutes after Xian Lin’er left, she rushed back with Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan stood at the door of Huo Yuhao’s laboratory and silently sensed what was going on. No one was as experienced as him. Elder Xuan had experienced many failures when he tried to form his second soul core. This was why he was very familiar with such an aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He only turned around after standing there for a full fifteen minutes. There was a serious look on his face. “That’s right, Lin’er is right. Yuhao is trying to form his second soul core now. From now on, I’ll personally watch over him. No one is allowed to get close to him or disturb him. No one is even supposed to make any loud noises.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Elder Xuan sat cross-legged right outside the door of the laboratory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er was astonished as she looked at Elder Xuan. “Elder Xuan, what about the academy? The Sun Moon Empire’s troops are coming soon!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan sighed and asked, “Lin’er, do you still not understand? Yuhao agreed with Wutong’s judgment during the meeting. He only didn’t mention anything because of the academy. We are too concerned about the academy’s safety. We didn’t believe his judgment. He knew he couldn’t do anything, so he returned to cultivate. As for the three soul engineer legions, there are only two reasons why he didn’t let them out. One is that he’s acting rashly. That’s highly unlikely though. As for the other reason, it’s that he’s trying to conserve the strength of our active forces.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er was doubtful. “Surely not. If his judgment is right, the Sun Moon Empire wouldn’t even attack us. Naturally, the three soul engineer legions would be untouched too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan shook his head and said, “You are still not far-sighted enough. Let me ask you, if the Star Luo and Dou Ling Empires come to reinforce us, can the academy just sit and watch if one of them is attacked? When that happens, we would have no choice but to send our soul engineer legions to help them. Not sending our soul engineer legions and having no soul engineer legions are two different things. Yuhao must have done this for a reason.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan wouldn’t have guessed that Huo Yuhao wasn’t really thinking a lot then. He had really forgotten…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xian Lin’er lowered her head. After remaining silent for a brief moment she said, “Elder Xuan, we can’t be complacent either. Even if there’s only a one in a thousand possibility, we must be ready to adapt to the circumstances. The academy has stood here for ten thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan replied, “Return. You and Shaozhe can handle things in the academy. I’ll stand guard here. If Yuhao manages to make a breakthrough, perhaps everything will be settled.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An astonished look flashed across Xian Lin’er’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao can settle everything if he makes a breakthrough? Is that even possible? After all, he’s only one person! Even given Elder Xuan’s strength, he’s already unable to do anything. Even if Yuhao has twin soul cores, how could he possibly compare to Elder Xuan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she didn’t reveal her doubts. Seeing that Elder Xuan was determined to remain, she could only return and report the situation to the rest of the members of the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Xian Lin’er left, Xu Sanshi and the rest were also chased away by Elder Xuan. Elder Xuan sat outside Huo Yuhao’s door by himself. There was a heavy look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhao, you’re really bold. You actually chose this path!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given Elder Xuan’s understanding of second soul cores, how could he not tell that Huo Yuhao wasn’t using Resonance to form his second soul core? On the contrary, he was extremely clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the Yin-Yang Complement could cause such a chaotic aura. However, there was a determined force that was hanging on amidst the chaos. This also meant that Huo Yuhao wasn’t in danger of running amok as of yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Elder Xuan couldn’t possibly cultivate his soul core using the Yin Yang Complement, he was still very curious, and eager to learn more about this cultivation method. This was why he was determined to stay. Furthermore, what he had said earlier was right too. If Huo Yuhao could cultivate his second soul core using the Yin Yang Complement, he could become another Beast God in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of innate talent, Huo Yuhao’s body wasn’t as physically strong as the Beast God. However, he had immense qualities that soul beasts didn’t possess – twin martial souls and Spirits. If he managed to form twin soul cores using the Yin Yang Complement, Elder Xuan believed that his abilities could catch up to those of the Beast God even if his cultivation was restricted at Rank 98.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was important not to forget that Huo Yuhao was adept at concealment. His immense spiritual power could change the entire war!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such an intelligent young man! He’s still able to make the correct choice even in such a chaotic and passive situation. No wonder he’s Elder Mu’s closed-door disciple. Elder Mu, you should really know how much I envy you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know anything about the outside world. Right now, he was already on the verge of caving in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On his chest, the force of Ultimate Ice was spinning faster and faster. The streak of spiritual power that the Ice Empress had released couldn’t stop it. It even spun in the opposite direction as it was sucked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this way, the spiritual power started to distort. Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core was touched, and it started to retaliate in anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Huo Yuhao was trying his best to stop it, the spiritual power released from his spiritual soul core couldn’t be contained, even with his willpower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ice Empress and Snow Empress maintained their composure, but Huo Yuhao felt that his body was about to be torn apart by these two different forces. The pain was indescribable, but it definitely exceeded the level he had been subjected to when he fused with the Ice Empress.</span></p>
