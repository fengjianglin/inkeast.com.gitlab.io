 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without any hesitation, Huo Yuhao poured even more soul power into Tang Wutong’s body and continued to restrain her soul core. At the same time, he also relaxed a little. He also ‘assaulted’ Tang Wutong’s spiritual soul core with some of his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To complete the formation of Yin-Yang Complement soul cores, it was impossible to avoid a clash, and the soul cores had to adapt to each other. No one was more experienced than Huo Yuhao when it came to this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the Beast God Di Tian was also experienced too. However, the difference was that Huo Yuhao was human! Huo Yuhao was the first human to form Yin-Yang Complement soul cores. When it came to this, no one could compare to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The smile on Huo Yuhao’s face widened. He also didn’t know how much time had passed. He only felt himself getting weaker and weaker. Not only was ninety percent of his spiritual power drained, but even his soul power was also drained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he felt much more comfortable like this. His twin soul cores also became much more balanced. The only difference was that he could restore his soul power through his cultivation. However, in the spiritual power aspect, it felt as if someone had taken ninety percent of his origin strength. So much time had passed, but he didn’t exhibit any signs of recovery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t seem to mind this. What could this count for? As long as Tang Wutong could recover, he was content. Right now, he only hoped that he wouldn’t become a moron after all of this was over. He believed that Tang Wutong wouldn’t look down on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he was even sure that she wouldn’t leave him even if he became an idiot. This was why he wanted that guarantee from Niu Tian and Tai Tan. If he really became an idiot, he didn’t want to become Tang Wutong’s burden!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden light from the golden trident finally retracted. Tang Wutong seemed to have completely absorbed Huo Yuhao’s spiritual soul core. As her spiritual and soul powers clashed, small, unstable whirlpools also started to form. Although they weren’t very stable, they appeared continuously. This also meant that the two soul cores were starting to adapt to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was good, this was very good!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that success was within reach, Huo Yuhao was delighted. He was aware that this was a sign that the Yin-Yang Complement twin soul cores were about to be completed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s soul power was above Rank 90 already. Once her twin soul cores formed, it was almost certain that she would become a Transcendent Douluo. As for how much his cultivation would drop, Huo Yuhao was also unsure. He had no time to think about it either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights flashed, and the soul power undulations in the air became stronger and stronger. Huo Yuhao shut his eyes. He even shut his Eye of Destiny. A strong sense of weakness quickly engulfed him, causing him to turn pale. However, there was still a slight smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A figure slowly stood up behind Tang Wutong. This figure had a slender figure, and his blue hair flowed behind his head. There was no flaw in his handsome and charming face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at Huo Yuhao with a complex look in his eyes. After a brief moment, he gently sighed. He lifted his hand and pressed it against Tang Wutong’s forehead. Suddenly, the golden trident shone. Something seemed to be injected into it, but it also seemed like something had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two balls of light shone behind Tang Wutong. One was a golden sun, while the other was a purplish-gold moon. Gold and purple intersected, which was a captivating sight to behold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue-haired man smiled in satisfaction and nodded gently. As he waved his hand, a gentle beam of light covered Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong’s soul cores shook. Following this, her soul power suddenly surged out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s soul power, which he had used to restrain Tang Wutong’s soul core earlier, was sucked in, as if it was being swept away by a tornado. The chain between Tang Wutong’s two soul cores also fully formed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beam of golden light suddenly shot out from Tang Wutong’s golden trident. It struck Huo Yuhao’s brow. His Eye of Destiny opened on its own because of the stimulation of this external force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this, Huo Yuhao felt that the remnants of his spiritual power had been completely drawn out from his spiritual sea. He was left completely void of spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The whirlpool around his soul core disappeared. What was left was only a golden object, which wasn’t very huge. At this instant, Huo Yuhao blacked out, and lost all consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Am I really going to become an idiot?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the last thought in his head. If he had one more second to think, he would certainly have hoped that Niu Tian and Tai Tan would fulfil their promise – bring his idiotic self away and vanish completely from Tang Wutong’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just his spiritual power that was completely drained. Even his soul power in his dantian was sucked away. Unprecedently bright light shone from Tang Wutong’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, it was time for Tang Wutong to support Huo Yuhao’s body as he sat there, his head slowly drooping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this moment that a figure silently shone from Huo Yuhao’s back. It was a man who had long, golden hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this enough?” The golden-haired man asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue-haired man nodded gently and replied, “Seeing that he’s willing to sacrifice himself for Wutong, I’ll forget about his succession of your godly seat. However, he’ll still need to work harder if he wants to marry my daughter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, the blue-haired man pushed his hands forward. Suddenly, the sun-moon radiance behind Tang Wutong’s back shone brightly. The golden-haired man also mimicked a pressing action towards Huo Yuhao’s body. Behind Huo Yuhao, a golden sun and a blue moon suddenly appeared. It was just that they shone less brightly than Tang Wutong’s golden sun and purplish moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden lights were like a bridge. Both golden suns illuminated each other, and their golden lights complemented each other. A gentle glow connected both suns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden sun behind Huo Yuhao’s back gradually became brighter as it was illuminated by the golden sun behind Tang Wutong. The strange thing was that immense spiritual undulations started to come from Huo Yuhao’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only this, but the blue moon behind his back also released a beam of light, which intersected with the purplish moon behind Tang Wutong’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the suns and moons intersected, their soul and spiritual power also started to interact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two soul cores inside Huo Yuhao’s body started to circulate, and his whirlpool-like soul power spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Streaks of black air started to spread from Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s body. They diffused into the air before slowly disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden-haired man snapped, “Don’t you think this is cheating? We can’t intervene in anything below.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue-haired man replied, “Cheating? I’m not! I’m only guiding my aura on my daughter’s body. She’s my flesh, and my blood runs in her. Who can say anything about this? As for Huo Yuhao, he’s received feedback from my daughter’s power because he saved her. That’s why something like this has happened. It’s not my doing. It’s theirs. I’m only using the Clear Sky Sect’s secret method.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden-haired man was unconvinced. “Clearly, you were the one who created that secret method.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so? Whatever. Alright, I’m going. Are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go. Tang San, I suddenly feel like whacking you. I’m not sure why. Furthermore, why do I have this feeling that I’m not benefitting at all?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not benefitting? Alright then! Let’s switch. You can leave with your godly seat. I’ll deal with him and let him inherit my position. I believe he won’t reject me with Wutong around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dream on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going. I can’t be bothered with you.” The blue-haired man took a step, and his body seemed to fuse with space. After this, he instantly vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden-haired man wore a complex expression on his face as he looked at Huo Yuhao. He lifted his hand and gently pressed it on Huo Yuhao’s head. Then, he nodded his head in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Trying to snatch my successor? Dream on.” He also took a step forward before he disappeared into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tai Tan came out from some unknown place and chuckled, “Is this considered a fight between immortals?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Niu Tian pushed open the door and walked in. “What? Even if immortals fight, they can only do it above, not here. Let’s not say anything more and just follow their instructions. This time, both of them are finally reaping rewards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao gradually regained consciousness, he first felt warmth. His entire body also felt very comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Am I still alive? Or am I in another world? It seems like one can still feel warmth in another world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly regained his awareness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course you’re still alive. You’ve never been better.” A slightly interesting voice sounded. Huo Yuhao was stunned for a moment. After this, he felt a very familiar aura. He thought of something before taking a look in his spiritual sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual sea was now a plot of land. Familiar figures started to appear in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A handsome man was playing with his long, golden hair. At the same time, this man was smiling at him. He was wearing a long, white robe, which was completely clean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Skydream.” Huo Yuhao said agitatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just the Skydream Iceworm in human form. There were also a few others around. For example, there was the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass also appeared in human form. It appeared as a simple and honest young man, and it was standing beside the Skydream Iceworm. On the other side, two beauties were staring at Huo Yuhao. Although they seemed aloof, they couldn’t hide their delight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chubby Ice Bear King was also smiling as he looked at Huo Yuhao. He opened his arms as he rushed over, giving Huo Yuhao a big bear hug.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The captivating Princess Li Ya was also grinning as she watched Huo Yuhao. Captivating tunes came from her mouth, as if hundreds of birds were singing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All, all of you are awake? Or am I meeting you in another world?” Huo Yuhao almost couldn’t catch his breath as he was hugged by the Ice Bear King. His voice was very unclear, but every one of his Spirits could tell what he was saying.</span></p>
