 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The White Tiger Duke’s eyes immediately shrank. He didn’t expect Huo Yuhao’s abilities to have grown to such a standard in just a short two years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was astonishing. It was already very difficult to accept the fact that he was a Titled Douluo who was barely twenty, much less a Transcendent Douluo who was barely twenty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Huo Yuhao wasn’t a Transcendent Douluo. He was still a Rank 89 Soul Douluo, yet to make his breakthrough. However, it must not be forgotten that he had a soul core. In terms of direct fighting strength, he was not weaker than a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He even had Tang Wutong with him. When he combined his power with Tang Wutong, the fighting strength that they could generate was indeed at the tier of a Transcendent Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of the three graduation tests that Shrek Academy set for Huo Yuhao, one of them involved Huo Yuhao being able to defeat Dean Yan Shaozhe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Shaozhe was a Class 97 Transcendent Douluo now. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong weren’t confident of beating him, but they were confident of escaping from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo was also Rank 97, but his abilities were still some way off from Yan Shaozhe. As a result, it was easy for Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong to resist the Heavenly Sun Douluo’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything sounded very slow, but it actually happened in a flash. After his attack was dissipated, the Heavenly Soul Douluo’s body instantly shone, and a blinding ball of sunlight also started to glow above his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless streaks of blinding golden light turned into rays of light that shot toward Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lofty Lightrays! It was the Heavenly Soul Douluo’s signature soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao remained unmoved. He slowly raised his right palm, which he had pushed forward earlier, and was now covered in diamond ice crystals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s martial soul was fire-type. Although it was of a very high quality, it was still some way off from Ultimate Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice martial soul was the jinx of fire-type martial souls. When his opponent’s martial soul wasn’t as strong as his, his martial soul would have an even greater effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He mimicked a lifting action, and the jade-green projection behind him disappeared. What replaced it was a fatso.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fatso was smiling from ear to ear, and his body exuded a strong icy-blue glow. He chuckled at the Heavenly Sun Douluo. Following this, a huge ball of icy-blue light shot violently into the air with Huo Yuhao at the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the eighth soul skill of Huo Yuhao’s Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, Icy Meteor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao clearly knew that it wasn’t easy for him to break free from an encirclement by more than ten Titled Douluo. Among these Titled Douluo, five of them were Transcendent Douluo. Although the combination of Tang Wutong and his abilities were extraordinary, it wasn’t possible for both of them to resist so many Titled Douluo at once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they couldn’t directly resist them, they could only find a means of escaping. Once they managed to put some distance between themselves and these Titled Douluo, Huo Yuhao could use his concealment abilities to flee. When that happened, there wouldn’t be any problems even if there were many more Titled Douluo around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why he immediately used his strongest soul skills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he first unleashed his Icy Meteor, it only appeared as a huge icy ball that was a meter in diameter. Nothing seemed to be very special about it. However, it kept growing larger as it rose. Furthermore, an icy aura was becoming stronger and more violent inside this icy ball.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Heavenly Sun Douluo’s lights struck this Icy Meteor, they were immediately dissipated. There wasn’t any effect at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s expression changed slightly. If he wanted to unleash a powerful soul skill, he would need time to accumulate his power. Huo Yuhao was able to use his Icy Meteor immediately because he was already prepared, and also because he had the help of his Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass had already appeared on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why the Heavenly Sun Douluo didn’t have time to unleash a powerful soul skill. He could only use his own immense strength to resist the Icy Meteor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang——” The Heavenly Sun Douluo’s palms struck the Icy Meteor. In his opinion, Huo Yuhao’s abilities were already at the standard of a Transcendent Douluo. At most, he would be flung away from trying to resist the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, something unexpected happened. When his palms struck the Icy Meteor, the Icy Meteor stopped for a moment. However, it didn’t blow apart. It didn’t unleash any extraordinary power either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Sun Douluo only felt as if there was a layer of glue on his palm, which glued it to the icy ball. Before he could even struggle, a weird yet terrifying power was violently unleashed from the Icy Meteor. It wasn’t an attack, but a thrusting force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was a meteor? It was an extremely rapid cluster of rock. This Icy Meteor wasn’t an exception. Under Huo Yuhao’s precise control, its explosive strength wasn’t unleashed. However, its speed was demonstrated almost instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, all the Titled Douluo saw how terrifyingly quick the Ice Meteor was. It had really turned into a real meteor that flew into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t fly away on its own. The Heavenly Sun Douluo was still with it! This Ice Meteor was clearly taking the Heavenly Sun Douluo away with it. It was so quick that it appeared like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant that Huo Yuhao had forcefully dragged a Rank 97 Titled Douluo away in just a few clashes, though whether he could harm the Heavenly Soul Douluo was another thing. At least he was able to isolate the Heavenly Sun Douluo from the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s right hand didn’t move down at all. The fatso behind his back changed to a ravishing yet mighty-looking lady, who seemed to dominate the entire world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was dressed in a long, white dress. She opened her arms behind Huo Yuhao’s back. Suddenly, an intense, deep-blue light turned into a huge beam of light that rose into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Heavenly Sun Douluo was greatly disadvantaged in the previous clash of hands. The rest of the Titled Douluo were slightly hesitant now. No one entertained the thought of striking first. This was because they were still unsure of how strong Huo Yuhao was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The beam of light shot into the sky. As it moved, countless snowflakes danced in the air, and the entire region was covered in an icy fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just like how the Heavenly Sun Douluo focused all the heat on Huo Yuhao earlier. When Huo Yuhao unleashed his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice, only the Titled Douluo were engulfed by this domain. Even the tents behind them were isolated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even so, all the Titled Douluo felt as if they had lost track of Huo Yuhao instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao’s cultivation increased, his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice naturally became much stronger. It became easy for him to isolate all use of Spiritual Detection. After all, that was his signature ability!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strong spiritual undulations were also released from his body. His eyes had turned completely golden. On his forehead, his vertical eye lit up. It was his Eye of Destiny.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two rays of the Light of Destiny descended from the sky and struck both him and Tang Wutong. Luck was on their side now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao held onto Tang Wutong’s little hand, and she naturally went into his embrace. Suddenly, a huge golden vertical eye suddenly appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, all the Titled Douluo were jolted to their senses. They used their powers to attempt to break out of the domain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was a powerful domain-type skill that was a combination of the Empress’ Chill and Huo Yuhao’s Domain of Perpetual Ice! Given how strong his combination with Tang Wutong was as well as the Snow Empress’ control of this skill, every Titled Douluo had to resist the blizzard and frenzied winds within the domain. They had to protect themselves before they could try breaking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was also at this moment that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s next soul skill was unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s abilities were as great as a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was already a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fusion skills unleashed by both of them were extremely powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Golden Road which was thirty meters wide and infinitely long appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five Titled Douluo were caught within this Golden Road. They only felt as if they had instantly fallen into a furnace. Their sensing of soul skills instantly vanished. Their own martial souls also disintegrated immediately. Even their clothes immediately melted. Suddenly, they were all petrified, and couldn’t move at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among these five Titled Douluo, one of them was even a Transcendent Douluo. However, he was still stuck in the same situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A purplish light projection suddenly rushed out at this moment. It was a huge, purplish dragon with butterfly wings. As it fluttered its wings, it was like a streak of flowing purple light. It was flying along the Golden Road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As it flew, countless small golden hammers scattered in the air. All the Titled Douluo that charged over were immediately stunned. They could only watch as the purplish light projection shot past. They couldn’t chase after it at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mantra Amidst the Void, Spiritual Tempest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The projection vanished amidst the golden light. The raging blizzard also slowly disappeared. What remained was only a bunch of Titled Douluo who were in shock as they looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were more than ten Titled Douluo! Were they so weak that they couldn’t keep two people here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course not. They didn’t think of linking up at all! In their eyes, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong were only juniors, no matter how talented they were. At most, they were only close to being Titled Douluo. The Heavenly Sun Douluo should have been enough to deal with both of them.</span></p>
