 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Run along. I will be returning to Shrek Academy with your sister-in-law tomorrow morning. I hope you will have become a Soul Emperor by the time I return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother, I will definitely do my best.” Dai Luoli was about to turn and leave. However, he suddenly stopped and turned around. He had an awkward expression on his face as he asked, “Brother, are you really not going to acknowledge him as your father? In these two years, he has aged a lot. If only you were by his side…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough!” Huo Yuhao growled in displeasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dai Luoli was stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao calmed down before continuing, “Run along. I will naturally settle my business with him in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Dai Luoli left, Huo Yuhao rubbed his face with his hands. Tang Wutong stood behind him and massaged his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, I really don’t know how to sort out my relationship with him. To be honest, my hatred for him has been decreasing. But am I really not going to avenge my mother?” Huo Yuhao could only share his true thoughts with Tang Wutong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong replied, “Regardless of whether you plan revenge or not, you should sort things out with him sooner or later. However, now is definitely not the right time. To be honest, don’t you think that his days are numbered? If the Sun Moon Empire were to launch another attack on the Ming Dou Mountain Range, the Star Luo Empire might not be able to fend them off. Hence, the most pressing matter at hand is to win the battle which is about to unfold.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing her words, Huo Yuhao nodded in agreement. “Yes, you’re right. There is no family without one’s country.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After meditating for an entire night, both Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong felt refreshed. Following which, they bade goodbye to the White Tiger Duke before returning to Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the Sun Moon Empire’s Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? The Prince has returned?” Xu Tianran was shocked as he looked at Ju Zi, who was hugging the Prince and tearing up before him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he did not have much feelings for the Prince, who was not his own child, he understood the importance of the existence of this prince for the stability of the Empire. Having a prince meant there was a successor to the throne. Hence, he was bent on using all possible methods to allow Ju Zi to recover the Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran regained his calm and asked, “What happened?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi was shedding tears of joy as she replied, “I have no idea what happened. After checking on the soldiers this morning, I returned to find the Prince lying in the bed. He was just having fun by himself. I have no idea who sent him back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The answer contained no useful information at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran frowned and said, “Previously, those Titled Douluo abducted the Prince to blackmail me. Why would they return the Prince so easily?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Could they have done it out of their conscience?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran would never have believed such an idea. He did not believe in the existence of a conscience. In his eyes, interests and benefits governed our universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite being interrogated about the details, Ju Zi remained very careful with her answers, and did not reveal any unnecessary details. She was a smart woman, and had fabricated a story along with all the minute details beforehand. She had merely delayed the news by a night.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After checking with Ju Zi, Xu Tianran summoned the guards and interrogated them. There was no doubt that their lives had been turned upside down after they had failed to stop the intruders the other time. Other than random pieces of useless information, they were unable to provide anything useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After punishing them for their failure the other time, Xu Tianran did not pursue the matter further. He ordered the Imperial Physician to make sure the Prince was alright and stopped all investigations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he was still very trusting of Ju Zi. In fact, she could be said to be the person who he trusted the most. There was no one else he placed the same amount of trust in. Xu Tianran was even planning to rely on her to conquer the world for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had cried her heart out that day when the Prince disappeared. Xu Tianran had always felt bad for letting that incident happen. Now that the Prince had returned, he felt that asking too many questions would not be appropriate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like those people must have started to panic after seeing our army assemble, and have decided to return the Prince to us. Do they really think this will stop me from my ambitions of conquering the world? They must be daydreaming. My Empress, our plan will remain the same. After we are done with our preparations, you will still be the Commander of the Three Armies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi nodded as she hugged her son tightly. She whispered, “Your Majesty, I have a small request to make.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go on.” Xu Tianran spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi hesitated a while before continuing. “The Prince’s disappearance had taken a lot out of me. I can’t stop blaming myself for not protecting him properly. This time, because I will be leaving for an extended period of time for the campaign, I wish to bring the Prince along with me to prevent a repeat of this incident.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing her words, Xu Tianran flew into a rage. “What?! You want to bring the future leader of our Empire onto the battlefield?! Ju Zi, has your ego gone to your head? How dare you raise such a request to me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ju Zi collapsed to her knees before Xu Tianran. She did not say anything as tears started to stream down her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran’s heart started to soften as he stood up and walked towards her. “I cannot allow you to do this. How can I let the successor to my throne leave the palace? You may rest assured that I will step up the palace security after you leave. I will make sure I get someone to protect the Prince and ensure that he does not come to any harm. I guarantee you that all of the above will be done. You know very well that even though the Prince is not my own child, I have no chance of having my own child. In the future, every plot of land and drop of water I own will belong to him. Hence, you must put in your best into this campaign. The Three Armies will be placed under your command. When you return victorious, I will bring the Prince and welcome you back personally. We will organize the biggest celebration for you when you return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, Your Majesty.” There was nothing else Ju Zi could say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, little Yunhan, who was sound asleep in Ju Zi’s embrace, woke up and exclaimed, “Father!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran, who was looking very serious, found his body trembling after hearing what little Yunhan had just said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of who he was, he was ultimately still human. Being infertile was one of the biggest blows for him in his life. Little Yunhan’s words had hit the softest part of his heart, making him feel guilty for making those remarks earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, he helped Ju Zi up from the ground before patting on her shoulder. He said, “Spend more time with him during these few days we have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father!” Little Yunhan cried out again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianran burst into laughter as he pinched little Yunhan’s cheek. “Yes, my little Prince. You must pray for the safety of your mother and wish for her to return victorious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Ju Zi carried Xu Yunhan out of the Imperial Study, her clothes were already drenched with sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Xu Tianran enjoyed being addressed as little Yunhan’s father, it was a nightmare for Ju Zi! This was because she knew little Yunhan was not calling for Xu Tianran. Ever since that little fellow learned how to speak, he had never called Xu Tianran father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this was the first time little Yunhan was calling out openly, Ju Zi knew that he was actually calling out for Huo Yuhao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Toddlers would never lie. Ju Zi was really afraid that little Yunhan would give it away. Fortunately, little Yunhan did not say anything other than the word father.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After bringing her son back to her room, Ju Zi let out a sigh of relief. However, she still had a very nervous expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After shutting the door, she laid her son on her bed as she gradually regained her calm. As she gently stroked little Yunhan’s hair, she muttered, “My dear baby, it’s really in your nature to be like this! Don’t worry! No matter how tough it might be, I will never let you suffer again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems like war is inevitable!” Elder Xuan sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao reported all the events that had occurred on his journey, including the time when he returned little Yunhan to Ju Zi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan did not ask too many questions, nor did he try to reprimand Huo Yuhao. All he did was let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This time round, even though we have managed to recharge and sharpen our capabilities, the Sun Moon Empire has also had the same two years to recuperate and recover what they have lost and expended. I can only imagine how devastating the war will be. Besides, as of now, we don’t even know where they will strike. This is the largest problem at hand. Yuhao, share your thoughts on this with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “The current situation has already become fairly clear. The Sun Moon Empire continues to possess an absolute advantage over us. Their soul tool technology should still remain above our expectations. If I were to hazard a guess, Ju Zi should still be the Commander. From what I understand about her since she was also a student of Teacher Xuan, her military talents far exceed her talents as a soul engineer. She is well-versed in different military strategies, and will be a difficult opponent. She was the one who drafted the plan to use their widely publicised attack on the Star Luo Empire as a decoy for their main attack on the Heavenly Soul Empire. Now, she possesses even greater strength, and it will be extremely difficult for us if we were to face her directly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since we can’t match their abilities and power, we have no choice but to employ an unorthodox strategy. Based on my calculations, the Sun Moon Empire will definitely place an army on the other side of the Ming Dou Mountain Range to monitor the troops of the Star Luo Empire and prevent them from invading. The bulk of their troops will enter the regions of the Heavenly Soul Empire they have already captured. This would allow them to link up with the troops that have fortified the border and intimidate the rest of the Heavenly Soul Empire. At the same time, they can continue to threaten and deter the troops from the Star Luo Empire. Even though the area where the Star Luo Empire connects with the original land of the Heavenly Soul Empire is fairly treacherous, it is a lot less dangerous than the Ming Dou Mountain Range. Hence, no matter what, the Sun Moon Empire will never give up their advantage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan nodded and asked, “So what is this unorthodox strategy you were talking about?”</span></p>
