Under the light of the moon, Li Yongyue’s Moonblade demonstrated the great offensive strength that an agility-type soul master should possess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo had been observing everything. After seeing that things were fine on Huo Yuhao’s side, she turned her attention to the other side. As she unleashed her Dazzling Golden Rope, the strongest few baboons were sent flying away. Only the weaker ones were left behind, but they were still tangled and restrained by the rope. Li Yongyue’s only job was to kill them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the front, the strongest five or six baboons couldn’t inch any closer as they were facing the bright moon in the sky. They roared furiously, but were helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan was calm from the very start. She was also observing everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dean Cai was missing at this point. Her whereabouts were unknown. But even though she didn’t fight, she was the backbone. Everyone was confident that she was around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, a large number of baboons were rushing toward them from all directions. Although they were entrenched atop the slope, it wasn’t a one versus one duel anymore. The pressure on them increased greatly, and Han Ruoruo’s immense fighting strength was demonstrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Han Ruoruo was Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er’s team member. It was also because of her presence that there was a sudden change in the soaring pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo pointed up, and her Dazzling Golden Rope shot into the sky, forming a golden halo in the air before it abruptly descended. As the halo descended, no one felt any threat from it. When it finally landed, four baboons were caught within it. The rest of the baboons, including the Bloody Baboon King, were located outside of the halo. The Baboon King had been struck by Zhang Lexuan earlier, and blasted out of the region of the halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next instant, the bright-golden halo blew apart and unleashed an immense explosive force. This explosive force didn’t possess tremendous destructive abilities. However, its impact was great. Countless baboons were sent flying, and they nocked down the rest of the baboons that were rushing up the slope. Only the four baboons within the halo remained there. The rest of the area was temporarily cleared of baboons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else was highly skilled, so they wouldn’t let such a great opportunity slip. Zhang Lexuan’s fifth soul ring shone brightly, and the crescent in the sky turned golden. Instantly, this crescent started to divide and form equally huge crescents that eventually streaked down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonfall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden-yellow crescents turned into reaper’s scythes. Two baboons in the ten-thousand year level were chopped in half as the moonlight crossed them. They didn’t even have a chance to unleash their Bloodlust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan wasn’t the only one who attacked. Li Yongyue also leapt up, and gestured towards the crescents above Zhang Lexuan. Suddenly, the surface of his Moonblade was covered in a layer of golden light. No one saw him using any soul skills. His figure only flashed by his target as his Moonblade displayed countless forms. In the next instant, one baboon froze in place, and several fresh wounds appeared on its body before it collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fourth baboon was taken down by Wang Qiu’er’s fist. The fight was simpler this time. After the golden halo toppled the other baboons, the Dazzling Golden Rope tangled that baboon. As Wang Qiu’er turned around, she jumped into the air, and her body was covered by a dim-golden light as she punched half the baboon’s body into the ground with her landing. It was unlikely to be alive after the blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er became bystanders as these few exchanges occurred. The two of them had reunited at this point. As they held hands, the Haodong Power circulated, and brought them to their strongest state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wang Qiu’er is very strong.” Huo Yuhao whispered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er nodded and replied, “She’s too wild. Turns out she’s one violent lady.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao grinned without speaking. He had a deeper impression of Wang Qiu’er eating a baked biscuit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An orange-gold light flashed, and the Snow Lady came out of Huo Yuhao’s body. Her deep blue eyes blinked as she watched the baboons reorganizing. After that, she turned to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er only interacted briefly before they started to attack. They moved up to the baboon that was pushed into the ground by Wang Qiu’er, and Huo Yuhao pressed his left hand on its body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er wasn’t idling either. With the support of their Haodong Power, both of them were surging with soul power. Wang Dong’er was a six-ringed Soul Emperor, and her cultivation was one level above Li Yongyue, Wang Qiu’er, and Mo Xuan. Her fourth soul ring lit up, and her two hands pointed forward successively. Hexagram Arrays started to rapidly appear on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These Hexagram Arrays were lined up in a specific way. Each array was five meters from the next array, but their colors were varied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from one at the front that was golden, the rest flashed before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hexagram Arrays were very restrictive, but only one could be used at a time. However, there was a technique in unleashing this soul skill. Although only one Hexagram Array could be used at a time, the position of multiple arrays could be set up beforehand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t such a need for such a setup in a duel. However, she could set up multiple arrays according to the geographical conditions if they were encircled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Baboon King had a fifty-thousand year cultivation. Seeing his own tribe members being massacred, he didn’t command them to rush up the slope. Instead, he roared furiously, and continued to unleash his Mass Berserk in a bid to neutralize Huo Yuhao’s Mass Enfeeblement. Following this, he roared three more times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the Bloody Baboons started to cry out, and thick blood fog was released from their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All the baboons were in a Bloodlust state now! Even Zhang Lexuan’s expression turned serious at this point. It was very difficult to deal with these baboons in their Bloodlust state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan turned and asked Huo Yuhao, “Yuhao, can your domain avoid harming those on your side?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “No. I can only prevent everyone from being attacked, but the low temperature is unavoidable. Eldest senior sister, why don’t Wang Dong and I charge ahead? I don’t think it’s too dangerous if we use my domain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No.” Zhang Lexuan rejected his proposition. He had to be joking. She was supposed to protect Huo Yuhao on this mission. How could she let him subject himself to danger?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Ruoruo said, “Then let’s stick to the original plan. Lexuan, we won’t hold back anymore if we really have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan nodded slightly. Her eight soul rings shone, and a dim silvery fog rose from her feet. Her body was covered by the fog, but she appeared indistinctly beautiful at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was shocked. Zhang Lexuan wasn’t using any soul skills now, but what was this silvery fog she had released?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through his Spiritual Detection, he could clearly sense Zhang Lexuan’s soul power and aura rising rapidly under the effect of the fog. It felt as if she was accumulating her strength. The crescent above her head grew larger and larger, and started to expand into a full moon. Zhang Lexuan’s eyes also shone with silver light at this point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er said softly, “Eldest senior sister seems to be using a secret technique to ignite her own strength. It feels similar to the baboons’ Bloodlust, only without the mania. If her soul power can be likened to water, then it must be boiling right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s explanation was very apt, and Huo Yuhao agreed with her assessment. However, this was evidently not the time to be bothered about this. Huo Yuhao didn’t hold back any further as he faced these strong enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dim golden streak of light shone from his forehead. Following this, a weird golden vertical eye slowly opened. When his eye opened, all the surrounding lights seemed to turn dark. Everyone, including the baboons, turned their attention to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
