Just like I mentioned yesterday, we’ll carry out our surveillance mission at a high altitude. In terms of position, I choose this.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao lifted his right hand, and a streak of golden light shot from his fingertip, pointing towards a spot on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After seeing the position that Huo Yuhao had singled out, the White Tiger Duke and Princess Jiujiu were astonished. Both of them lifted their heads and looked sharply at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was pointing to the highest mountain peak of the Ming Dou Mountain Range. More importantly, it was at that spot where the Light of the Death God was first unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Princess Jiujiu hesitated. “Yuhao, the higher the mountain peak, the more dangerous it’ll be for you. There are bound to be surveillance soul tools there. Why don’t we change the position?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head and replied, “The safest place is the most dangerous place. Naturally, they’ll know that it’s the safest spot. This is why they might not put all their attention on it. I hope that the empire will coordinate with me and ambush them from this and that side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said, he pointed to two spots at opposite ends of the Ming Dou Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a minute, Yuhao,” the White Tiger Duke suddenly said. He lifted his head and looked at Huo Yuhao with a deep look in his eyes. He said, “Honestly, this spot that you just pointed out is actually where we would like to surveil the most. However, I can’t let you go there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His contradictory words left Huo Yuhao feeling warm and comforted. Compared to Princess Jiujiu, it seemed he was more compassionate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” Xu Sanshi asked doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke took a look at Princess Jiujiu, who was red with embarrassment right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao lifted his right hand and pointed at the highest peak. “It was at this place that two thousand soul masters who were at least Soul Sages were all killed, causing us to suffer heavy losses. I can’t let Yuhao take this risk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” After hearing his words, everyone from Shrek immediately understood. They had heard about the Light of the Death God before. They didn’t expect the Death God, which was close to a Class 10 soul tool, to be located there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao sighed and said, “I’m sure all of you could guess. That’s right, that’s where the Death God of the Sun Moon Empire is located. That Light of the Death God was a tragic experience for us. I’m sure you can understand how limited our information on the Death God is. Furthermore, it’s located at the highest mountain peak. That is why I can’t let you go, Yuhao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi sighed and said, “You indeed can’t go close to that soul tool! Yuhao, this spot that you’ve chosen is the most dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know,” Huo Yuhao replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You know?” At this moment, everyone focused their attention on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “I know. I’m also a soul engineer. If I owned a powerful soul tool like the Death God, I’d definitely place it on the highest peak. If I don’t remember wrongly, the effective range of the Death God is five thousand meters. To cross the Ming Dou Mountain Range, one naturally has to climb mountains. The Death God can cover the sky and ground at the same time. It’s at a spot that fully taps into its destructive power. That is why I expected the Death God to be on this mountain peak when I chose it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, the most dangerous place is also the safest place. No matter how intelligent the soul engineers from the Sun Moon Empire are, they wouldn’t expect our target to be the Death God. This soul tool is our greatest threat. If we can find out more information about it, it might make it easier for us to fight the Sun Moon Empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao furrowed his brow and said, “No, it’s too dangerous. If something happens to you, how can I account to Shrek Academy? Your courage is commendable, but I can’t let you make such an irresponsible choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao softened when he saw the determined look in Dai Hao’s eyes. With regards to the position of the Death God, Dai Hao didn’t conceal anything. If he considered the benefit to the empire, he could most certainly allow Huo Yuhao to carry out the surveillance. If he succeeded, the Star Luo Empire would benefit greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t do so. Instead, he revealed everything. No wonder his subordinates were so loyal to him. The White Tiger Duke was very influential in the military. It would be great if he wasn’t Huo Yuhao’s father. If that were the case, Huo Yuhao might actually sacrifice everything to help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Huo Yuhao’s dazed look, Dai Hao continued saying, “Choose another spot. We’ll continue to coordinate with you. Even if you want to survey the position where the Death God is, we must try it from other spots first. We have to ensure that you’ll be safe before we plan anything else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was silent for a moment before saying, “White Tiger Duke, I’m really confident. It’s best if we try it for our first time because it’s the most sudden. There are bound to be many soul tools around the Death God. However, they are limited in their range. Among them, the few soul tools that can detect me are only effective at short range. Also, you’re already aware how good my detection abilities are. If it’s unidirectional, I can inspect things from up to seven kilometers away. This means that I don’t even have to enter the effective range of the Light of the Death God to survey it. As for how much I can find out, it’ll depend on my luck.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke was awed when he heard Huo Yuhao mentioning a range of seven kilometers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Titled Douluo, he was definitely aware of how important it was to have strong spiritual power. It was increasingly difficult to advance further once one became a Titled Douluo. There were two very important barriers to overcome along the way. First, the body of the Titled Douluo had to be able to withstand ever more soul power. Second, the Titled Douluo had to have sufficient spiritual power to control and summon his enhanced soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Both were necessary. A Titled Douluo could only reach the next tier if both factors went hand-in-hand. The difference between every tier after becoming a Titled Douluo was extremely great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said that he could survey up to seven thousand meters in one direction. It was Dai Hao’s first time hearing of such immense spiritual power. Among all the Titled Douluo that he knew, he didn’t know anyone who was that strong. Having such strong spiritual power was perfect for surveillance purposes . Even with the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools, they shouldn’t be able to detect him from such a distance. Huo Yuhao was just like a Class 9 soul tool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu was very excited, and looked at Dai Hao. “Marshal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her intention was immediately understood. To the Star Luo Empire, inspecting the Death God was too important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao took in a deep breath and looked at Huo Yuhao seriously before asking, “If you really want to survey the Death God, how do you want us to support you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao replied, “I need you to feign an attack to draw the Sun Moon Empire’s attention and create an opportunity for me. At the same time, I need a Titled Douluo who is adept at flying to send me high into the sky, the higher the better. Five thousand meters is the minimum. If greater heights are possible, I hope you can send me even higher up. That would be even safer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke nodded slightly and said, “Yuhao, let me ask you one more time. Are you confident? Even if you don’t succeed, it’s fine. I need to ensure your safety.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dai Hao was very impressed by Huo Yuhao’s words. Right now, the Northwestern Field Army was lacking in surveillance. Huo Yuhao’s arrival would greatly help them in this aspect. If he wasn’t boasting, the Star Luo Empire would be greatly helped in this war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and said, “There are no absolutes in this world, and everyone only has one life. I’ll naturally do my best to guarantee my own safety. I’m eighty percent confident that I’ll come through unscathed. But I’m only twenty to thirty percent confident of clearly surveilling the Death God. After all, it’s the number one soul tool in the Sun Moon Empire. I’m sure there are many restrictions about it. Even if my spiritual power can engulf it, I’m not sure that I’ll be able to find out anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke nodded slightly. “Alright, Yuhao, I’ll count on you, then. As long as you can return safely, I’ll count it as a major merit. If you can find out what’s going on with the Death God, I’ll definitely guarantee that you’ll become a viscount and commander of your own legion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Jiujiu was stunned when she heard his words. She understood the White Tiger Duke very well. It was extremely difficult to gain a promotion under him. However, if one managed to do so, it was bound to be very good. There weren’t any shortcuts, however. One had to earn his promotion through his own merits.</span></p>
