 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan no longer bothered with Du Busi. He turned to Huo Yuhao and said, “Yuhao, have you considered how you’re going to establish this organization? What will it be named?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was discussing things among themselves, but now their eyes returned to Huo Yuhao. After Huo Yuhao rescued those hostages at Sunrise City and with his discovery of Spirits, Huo Yuhao shared the same status as those powerful Titled Douluo. They understood that this creative and ingenious prodigy from Shrek Academy would undoubtedly become one of the strongest individuals on the Continent in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Establishing a supervisory body that was shared among the three empires and forming a conference hall of soul masters for decision-making was as generous as Shrek could be. The various powerful individuals wouldn’t say too much about how the organization was going to be established, what it was going to be named and whatnot because as the inventor of Spirits, Huo Yuhao had the most right to make these decisions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao thought for a moment, then answered, “The main purpose of this organization that we are going to establish is to focus on reducing the killing of soul beasts by humans and to gradually change the relationship between humans and soul beasts. Doing so will catalyze the completion of the equal contract between humans and soul beasts, and Spirits will be a way for soul beasts to transmit their spirits on. Why don’t we call this organization ‘Spirit’? My teacher, the one who taught me how to execute this contract, left another secret method to create a magic formation in the shape of a tower so that the process of transmitting spirits will become easier, and so that a soul master’s spiritual power can be more condensed. Therefore, our organization will be called… the&nbsp;</span>Spirit Pagoda<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. How’s that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I suggest that Shrek City construct the first Spirit Pagoda. At the same time, the Spirit Pagoda’s headquarters will be located in Shrek City. Shrek Academy is recognized by all three empires as a public place, so establishing the tower’s headquarters in Shrek City will be most appropriate. After the first Spirit Pagoda is completed successfully, the second batch of towers will be established within all three empires’ capital cities. These towers will serve as emblems for the organization, and they will also transmit spirits at the same time. My suggestion is for the third batch of towers to be established in cities that are relatively closer to soul beast habitats. This way, transmitting spirits will become a lot more convenient. As for how the organization will be established and what the rules will be, I’ll have to ask you and the Academy to decide that with the empires’ top officials.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Pagoda was called a tower, but in reality, more of how it was named was because Huo Yuhao wanted to commemorate his teacher, the Calamity Necromancer Electrolux, who had passed away. Electrolux once said that one of the proudest things that he had done in his life was that he had once erected an eternal tower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had never seen that tower, but that tower was undoubtedly what his teacher liked most. He decided to name this new organization as a tower to commemorate him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan tilted his head as he listened to Huo Yuhao’s words. He was very satisfied with Huo Yuhao’s suggestions; the organization’s name wasn’t that big a deal, as it was just a label. What was more important was that Huo Yuhao had suggested that the Spirit Pagoda’s headquarters be located in Shrek City. This meant that forces from all over the world would deploy powerful individuals to be stationed at Shrek.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the second batch of Spirit Pagodas would come long after the first one was constructed, because the first tower had to train sufficient soul masters with spiritual-type martial souls so that they could expand their organization. After this period of time, Shrek City would undoubtedly wield absolute authority over anything with regards to transmitting spirits. If the Great Star Dou Forest cooperated with them, it wouldn’t take long for Shrek City and Shrek Academy’s status to rise by yet another level on the Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t swallow the secret of Spirits by himself, yet he also helped the Academy develop rapidly. What he had done was the greatest benefit that the Academy could reap. That gloomy shadow in Elder Xuan’s heart because Huo Yuhao possessed necromantic abilities dampened a little. At least, from what he could see right now, everything about Huo Yuhao was still normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan didn’t express his opinions directly. Instead, he turned to everyone else and asked them, “Does anyone have any objections to Yuhao’s suggestion?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This group included Du Busi, and these powerful individuals shook their heads and expressed that they had no objections and that they approved of Huo Yuhao’s suggestions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy had publicized the secret of Spirits, which was a very important one, to the outside world. They were also going to establish an organization that everyone could participate in. The most important issue had been resolved, and it would be extremely shameless if anyone still didn’t want to let Shrek Academy reap some benefits from this arrangement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Huo Yuhao was right. Shrek Academy had always been known for their independence, and they weren’t biased towards anyone. Establishing the tower’s headquarters in Shrek City was most appropriate, and even though Shrek City was inside the Heavenly Soul Empire, Shrek City was actually similarly distanced from all three capital cities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned towards the Beast God Di Tian, and Di Tian tilted his head in his direction. Di Tian also approved of his suggestions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao would have to continue with his experiments, and all kinds of sophisticated and strict research would have to come next so that he could base the abilities of Spirits on solid ground. Other than that, everyone would have to deal with the various and numerous administrative tasks needed to establish the Spirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those powerful individuals all returned to their respective empires. They brought their first batch of soul masters who possessed Spirits to their empire’s royal families to convince them. Everyone began to work on everything that had to do with establishing the Spirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao spent most of the subsequent month on his experiments. Furthermore, experiments weren’t the only things he had to do; he also had to draw the Spirit Pagoda’s construction blueprints, and he had to record the spell for the equal contract and how to use it. This precious knowledge was sealed and stored inside the Sea God’s Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody asked Huo Yuhao about his army of undead, and Huo Yuhao didn’t return to Shrek Academy. Di Tian requested he remained in the Great Star Dou Forest to continue his experiments, which also meant that he could let Shrek Academy’s people see him, but they couldn’t bring him back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t object much to those requests, and he spent the subsequent month working hard at many different tasks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek City was also very busy. They had sustained heavy losses when the beast wave washed over them. Repairs required quite some time and a lot of materials and resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek’s merchants and businessmen began to work on all fronts. Furthermore, after those soul masters returned to their respective countries, it didn’t take long before the three empires sent diplomats to Shrek City to discuss matters regarding the construction of the Spirit Pagoda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao had predicted, not a single empire could resist the appearance of Spirits. The diplomats sent forth by those countries were here to negotiate and discuss how exactly the Spirit Pagoda was to be established, and how this organization was to be controlled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The incumbents underwent a long and drawn-out negotiation. Huo Yuhao didn’t even bother to ask about how the negotiations progressed, because these things were no longer important to him. He believed that everything would be fine with Shrek Academy at the helm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, those spiritual-type soul masters that the Spirit Pagoda produced in the future would be called Spirit Masters, which would be considered a new and separate profession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three empires dispatched representatives from their various sects and academies to become part of the Spirit Pagoda’s conference hall. Every empire had nine seats, and every member had to at least be a Soul Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every empire had to ensure at least three people who were members of the Spirit Pagoda’s conference hall were stationed in Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides these twenty-seven members, Shrek Academy would also choose nine people to become members. Their status was similar to that of an empire, as they participated in the Spirit Pagoda’s future development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All thirty-six members would control the entire Spirit Pagoda’s operation and development, while the headquarters would still be established in Shrek City. Huo Yuhao had discovered Spirits, so he was nominated as the hall’s thirty-seventh member. Furthermore, only he would be a member for life!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Spirit Pagoda would have to choose four Pagoda Masters – one main one and three deputies – to deal with daily administrative tasks and whatnot. Every ten years, the Pagoda’s members and its Pagoda Masters would be reelected, while no member could remain in office for more than two terms. Only those who were members before could participate in the election to become a Pagoda Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone nominated the Master of the Sea God’s Pavilion, Elder Xuan, as the first Pagoda Master. One Titled Douluo from each of the three empires who were of good moral standing and reputation were nominated as Vice-Pagoda Masters.</span></p>

He didn’t participate directly in the Spirit Pagoda’s management, but his status within the organization was exceedingly high as, after all, Spirits and the Spirit Pagoda wouldn’t be around if not for him.</span></p>

In other words, he didn’t have to represent the four different parties in the election.</span></p>

After discussing things with the Great Star Dou Forest, the Spirit Pagoda wasn’t constructed within Shrek City in the end. Instead, it was located five kilometers outside of Shrek’s southern city wall.</span></p>

Di Tian personally led this group, and he was part of the conference hall, along with the Emerald Swan Bi Ji, the Demoneye Tree Myriad Demon King, the Bear Lord, and the Three-Headed Devilmastiff. Five Savage Beasts represented the soul beasts within the conference hall. One Savage Beast would be permanently assigned to the conference hall to participate in all sorts of discussions and administrative matters. Furthermore, the soul beasts’ representative would have a special status, and this representative would have veto power for the conference hall’s decisions. Of course, this veto power couldn’t come from just one of them – all five Savage Beasts had to make a decision before Di Tian could propose and use their veto power.</span></p>

This meant that there was no other organization across the entire Continent that could compare to the Spirit Pagoda’s backing.</span></p>

Di Tian personally stepped out to communicate with several other soul beast habitats so that he could spread the situation about Spirits to these other habitats.</span></p>
