 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is this?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undoubtedly, it was another soul tool that Huo Yuhao had never seen before. However, just because he had never seen it before didn’t mean that it wasn’t dangerous. His senses were also very acute. Although the white halo had yet to reach him, he could judge that it wasn’t offensive or lethal. However, it contained gentle undulations, and a spiritual aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spiritual-type, oscillation detector? Once-off thing? This isn’t good. It’s trying to locate my position!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a brief moment of judgment, Huo Yuhao immediately reacted. The white halo covered more and more area as it spread out. At first, it was only a meter wide. However, it instantly grew to more than a hundred meters wide, and it continued to expand further. At such a speed, it would be more than five hundred meters wide by the time it reached Huo Yuhao. There wasn’t any way he could avoid it if it expanded to that width.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this critical moment, Huo Yuhao’s decisiveness developed during the Ultimate Soldier Plan played a prominent role. He put his flying-type soul tool away without any hesitation and allowed himself to freefall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might possibly enter the surveillance range of the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools. However, he wasn’t willing to be engulfed by the white halo even if he ran the risk of doing just that. He could sense a lethal threat from that non-lethal, inoffensive white halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He fell very quickly. The wind around him was extremely strong, but Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power kept him focused on the white halo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His quick reaction saved him. That white halo swept past his head, and only slowly dissipated around ten kilometers from the mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As it swept past his head, Huo Yuhao immediately confirmed his judgment earlier. He was right. There wasn’t any strong aura within that white light. However, it clearly contained some kind of special frequency wave, as well as a light spiritual aura. That was sufficient to determine the position of anyone it ran into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he fixed his gaze on the mountain peak, Huo Yuhao could subtly see a dim-red object flashing slightly before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lucky!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If his position had been determined, he might have been struck a deadly blow in the next instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of power does this mountain peak possess? Its defense is actually so strong! My spiritual power only slightly touched the barrier before such a huge reaction was sparked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he thought to himself, Huo Yuhao summoned his soul power and reduced the momentum of his fall. His Imitation was fully unleashed before he slowly opened his butterfly-winged flying-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t open it too quickly, as he was falling too fast. If things went amiss, his flying-type soul tool would be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he lowered his head to look at the detector on his wrist, Huo Yuhao cursed to himself. This short period of freefall had caused his altitude to fall from thirty-five hundred meters to twenty-five hundred meters. He was within the range of the Sun Moon Empire’s surveillance soul tools now. Even though there were only a few soul tools that could detect him, he would have raised alarm bells by now. Very soon, he was sure to be the focus of all surveillance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What should he do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every time he was in such a crisis, Huo Yuhao was always stimulated to the best of his potential due to the massive pressure. This time was no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that his surveillance mission today would be unlikely to yield too much progress. However, it wasn’t a complete failure. At least he had managed to see what was going on at the mountain peak. He had to return now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He managed to halt his freefall, and changed his unidirectional detection to an all-around detection, sensing the changes coming from the Ming Dou Mountain Range. At the same time, he unleashed his Spiritual Interference while using his Imitation. With his Spiritual Interference, hundreds of square meters of air around him were covered in invisible spiritual undulations. Any form of surveillance that entered this region would certainly be affected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like Huo Yuhao had judged, the Sun Moon Empire’s reaction was quick. It was just a matter of seconds before several surveillance soul tools were up around Huo Yuhao. These souls tools employed virtually all the types of surveillance abilities that were available. All that surveillance was focused on Huo Yuhao. They were directly aimed at the region below where the white light had passed earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Empire’s experience in terms of reconnaissance through surveillance soul tools impressed Huo Yuhao. They must have concluded that he couldn’t possibly fly upward, and could only choose to descend. At such an altitude, he couldn’t gain any speed if he tried to fly. Furthermore, they clearly didn’t locate him earlier, though they were clearly studying the region he was in right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He turned around immediately. He couldn’t care about being exposed now. He opened his flying-type soul tool fully and turned into a streak of flowing light before charging toward the military base of the Star Luo Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind those surveillance soul tools, a dozen figures continued to chase him. Without a doubt, the Sun Moon Empire had sent out their most outstanding soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very impressed with how the Sun Moon Empire was able to seal off all counter-surveillance on them. His appearance drew great attention from the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone powerful from the Sun Moon Empire gave out instructions that Huo Yuhao had to be killed, no matter the price! A spiritual-type soul master that could perform long-range surveillance was too important for the Star Luo Empire. However, it was very rare to find such a soul master, so the Sun Moon Empire was determined to kill him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Sun Moon Empire’s judgment of Huo Yuhao was also very accurate. They didn’t think that the Star Luo Empire had any soul tools that could perform long-range detection. Since it wasn’t a soul tool, it had to be a soul master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Huo Yuhao unleashed his full strength, his release of soul power reached a maximum immediately. This was something ordinary soul masters couldn’t do. Releasing soul power was generally something that required a process. Releasing soul power at such an immense speed might cause damage to the passageways of ordinary soul masters. In fact, it might be so damaging that it was life-threatening! This was especially relevant to soul masters whose soul power was very dominant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Huo Yuhao didn’t have any such problems. His body had gone through a major transformation through his immense spiritual power. His body was much stronger than most other soul masters. It was like he was using the body of a Soul Douluo or Titled Douluo to control the soul power of a Soul Sage. He would be fine even if he unleashed all his soul power suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment he tried to escape with full force, the surveillance soul tools behind had already roughly located his position. Among the figures that chased after him, the one that was leading the pack raised his hand before a ball of blinding golden light shot out. This ball of golden light shot like a shooting star towards Huo Yuhao. After around hundred meters, it suddenly blew apart, and turned into a huge patch of golden rain that engulfed the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Domain-type attack! His enemies had realized that Huo Yuhao’s position could not be specifically determined. The purpose of this domain-type attack wasn’t to kill Huo Yuhao, but to determine his specific position. At the same time, it would also slow his escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stationary soul cannon shell? So brutal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was also a soul engineer. He could tell how powerful that soul tool was, at least a Class 6 stationary soul cannon shell. The Sun Moon Empire was going all out with their efforts to kill him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Snorting coldly, Huo Yuhao maintained his speed. A deep-blue projection suddenly appeared behind him. It was the Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady sat on Huo Yuhao’s shoulder. Her slender figure resembled that of a teenager right now. Her face looked as refreshing, austere, and confident as ever. She raised her right hand as she faced behind him. Suddenly, the cold currents in the air started to gather at an alarming speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As deep blue lights flashed, large patches of deep-blue snowflakes appeared in front of the Snow Lady. These snowflakes weren’t very evident in the night sky. However, they soon gathered to form a huge, deep-blue whirlpool. The golden rain that chased him was quickly devoured by this whirlpool, and disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Snow Lady raised her head and looked at the sky. She pointed her left hand into the distance and a glaring, deep-blue glow formed on her hand. Even though it wasn’t as cold at an altitude of twenty-five hundred meters as compared to five thousand meters, it was still much colder compared to the ground. To the Snow Lady, it was undoubtedly a great opportunity to demonstrate her abilities, and this was not even including the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass was on Huo Yuhao’s other shoulder.
