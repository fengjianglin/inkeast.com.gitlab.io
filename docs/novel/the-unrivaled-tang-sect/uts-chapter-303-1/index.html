When I was young, my father was the one who taught me soul engineering skills. In my entire lineage, there has always only been one son in every generation. We are like a sect, but we don’t have the depth of a sect. My father always believed that he could teach me with everything that he had, thus he didn’t send me to a basic soul engineering academy. However, he passed away for some unknown reason when I was fourteen, and I had just become a Class 3 soul engineer. When we found him, even his internal organs had disappeared. He had died tragically. My father was also very protective of his wealth. He was very worried no matter where he kept his valuables, and usually kept them with him in his storage-type soul tool. Once he died, my family went bankrupt. My mother passed away early. We originally had a few servants, but they left since I couldn’t pay them. Very soon, I became an orphan that lived by myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gao Dalou sounded very calm. However, the expression on his face revealed that his heart was already dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After that, I had to give up on my cultivation in order to make a living for myself. I found some chores in the city. Originally, I was a soul engineer, and finding a job wasn’t very difficult. However, I would be cursed every time I suggested that my employer offer me some rare metals for my cultivation. As I was helpless, I could only do some chores that were beyond what I could handle. I earned some money to sustain myself. At the same time, I cultivated using my father’s manual. After more than a decade, I managed to reach the level of a Class 5 soul engineer. However, I’m broke now. At my level, I can’t experiment without sufficient rare metals, and I can’t produce better soul tools either. Ah…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was confused after he heard Gao Dalou’s recounting of events. It was his first time hearing a Class 5 soul engineer being restricted by poverty. Even though he had other ideas in mind, he couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Gao, didn’t your soul tools become finished products? With your abilities, you should be able to sell your finished soul tools for decent prices even if the materials are slightly inferior. They should then be enough to fund your cultivation. Since when did soul engineers lack money?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gao Dalou looked a little embarrassed, “This… honestly speaking, I’m not afraid that you’ll mock me. My entire family has a bad habit. We are stingy. I inherited my father’s stinginess. I can’t bear to sell the soul tools that I’ve created! They are the products of my hard work.” He coughed twice as he finished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s lips moved a little. He was a little empathetic after hearing Gao Dalou’s tragic life story. However, he realized that there wasn’t any tragic story that had no reason in this world after hearing about Gao Dalou’s stinginess! Gao Dalou’s poverty was caused by himself! What a stingy soul engineer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After pausing for a moment, Huo Yuhao asked, “What do you plan to do from now on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gao Dalou sighed and said, “What else do you want me to do? I’m a Class 5 soul engineer now. I’m different from before. Maybe I’ll find a sect and see if I can get some rare metals to practice with. Brother, I believe you’re at least a Class 5 soul engineer judging from your abilities to create soul tools. Your technique is also quite conventional and orthodox. You should be from a sect. Why not introduce me to your sect? I’ve no other requests; I just need sufficient materials. If I get to keep all my soul tools, I’m willing to even sell my life to the sect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao looked at him deeply and said to Wang Dong’er, “Xiao Dong, tell the waiter that we don’t need the liquor anymore. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.” Wang Dong’er acknowledged his words and tried to hold in her laughter as she walked away. She knew that Huo Yuhao was about to con someone again. However, Gao Dalou didn’t look very pitiful. He was actually very scheming!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, no! Don’t go! Brother, we haven’t had a drink yet. Even if they might blacklist you, they won’t serve you bad liquor, considering your wealth!” Gao Dalou hurriedly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the waiter had entered and there was a bottle of pink liquor on a tray in his hand. There were also three liquor glasses and a bucket of ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, your liquor is here. Do you want me to open it for you?” the waiter asked Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao turned to look at Gao Dalou. Gao Dalou said, “Open, open, of course you should open it! Hurry up!” As he spoke, he was already swallowing visibly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Brother Gao, liquor will make our hands numb. Overdrinking might even cause them to tremble and affect our state. You must watch out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gao Dalou was completely unbothered, “No worries. No worries. We can do it occasionally.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The waiter opened the bottle without any hesitation. He added three ice cubes to each glass before pouring the liquor into each glass. After that, he respectfully left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gao Dalou lifted the glass in front of him and took a sip. His face became rapturously intoxicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good liquor, this is good liquor! I’ve not had such great rose liquor in some time! It’s delicious. Brother, quickly take a sip.” As he spoke, he quickly filled his glass again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao lifted his glass and gently took a sip. The liquor was indeed quite good. A light rose scent entered his throat along with the liquor itself. The scent seemed to evaporate naturally. Very quickly, it diffused through his body. A warm aura also slowly spread out and made him feel extremely comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What left Huo Yuhao stunned was that the chill in his body from the origin energy of Ultimate Ice also dropped after he took a sip of the drink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was the alcohol able to help him absorb the origin energy of his Ultimate Ice? With this thought, he completely downed the glass of liquor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was completely stunned at the result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The warmth from the alcohol suddenly increased greatly. He felt the flow of his blood getting stronger and stronger. The warmth followed his passageways and rushed towards his left arm and lower limbs. Although it was still inferior compared to the origin energy of Ultimate Ice, this gush of warmth still neutralized some of the origin energy. It also fused with his blood and soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This works?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gao Dalou was watching Huo Yuhao as he sipped on his liquor. When he realized Huo Yuhao’s expression was changing very weirdly, he was shocked. Although this rose liquor wasn’t cheap, he didn’t have to feel so much pain buying it...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Tang, are you okay?” Gao Dalou asked carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao shook his head. He had originally wanted to draw Gao Dalou into the Tang Sect, but he realized that Gao Dalou was actually very cunning, even though he seemed very honest. In addition, he was now much less interested in him as he faced this unexpected surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dong’er, call the waiter over.” As he was agitated, Huo Yuhao even forgot that he wasn’t supposed to refer to her her that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Wang Dong’er didn’t know why he was suddenly so excited, she still quickly called the waiter over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, what instructions do you have?” the waiter asked respectfully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Go get me every type of liquor you have here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Every type? Sir, we have more than hundred types of liquor, even though our establishment isn’t that large! We already have forty different types of wine, and…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay, go quickly then.” As he spoke, Huo Yuhao threw his entire bag of money over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The waiter was shocked, but a flash of greed crossed his face as he received the bag of cash. He followed with, “Yes, yes, I’ll go now! Please wait for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More than a hundred types of liquor! How much would that cost?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only was Gao Dalou astonished, even Wang Dong’er didn’t understand what Huo Yuhao was doing. Huo Yuhao poured himself another glass of the rose liquor.</span></p>

After that, he twisted his head to look at Gao Dalou, “Brother Gao, you can leave first if you have nothing going on. I suddenly remembered I have something important to deal with.”</span></p>

Brother, how can you be without a buddy when you are drinking. I can’t do anything else, but I can be a top-notch drinking buddy!” Gao Dalou couldn’t give up this opportunity to taste so many delicious liquors. He quickly presented himself to Huo Yuhao.</span></p>

I didn’t get any for you.”</span></p>

There were more than hundred types of liquor. How would it feel to drink and compare them? He had never tried it before! It should feel very magical. However, he was being chased away. This…</span></p>

Let’s see if this works: I can join your sect. As long as you provide me with materials, the soul tools that I create will belong to the sect. However, please give me at least some money to buy wine. It’s best if I can even find a wife. I’ll follow you if you agree to this.”</span></p>

He hadn’t expected Gao Dalou to misunderstand his actions. He had actually lowered his own asking price of his own accord. What was going on?</span></p>

It was easy to find friends, but not drinking buddies! Gao Dalou was completely convinced after seeing Huo Yuhao ask for more than a hundred types of liquor in one shot. He was imagining the amount of liquor he could drink every day if he followed Huo Yuhao! Why would he need soul tools then?</span></p>
