 <p><strong>Book 10: Shrek's Seven Monsters</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 67.1: Ultimate Transformation! Attribute Amplification!</strong></p>
 <p>The core strength of Dai Yueheng’s team was comprised of Chen Zifeng, Ling Luochen, and himself. Among the other four, Xu Sanshi was comparatively stronger in terms of direct combat. The remaining three consisted of Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>To them, the only advantage brought about by having Huo Yuhao on their team was that Ling Luochen’s ability shouldn’t be restricted, but that was all.</p>
 <p>Elder Xuan indicated for both parties to space out, but he didn’t give them time to familiarise themselves with one another this time around. As soon as both parties were a hundred and fifty metres apart he sounded the command for them to begin.</p>
 <p>Both sides were closer to one another this time around. As soon as Elder Xuan gave the signal to begin, the Control System Battle Soul Masters on both sides immediately activated their skills.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng, Chen Zifeng, and Xu Sanshi were in front, Ling Luochen was in the middle, and Wang Dong, Huo Yuhao, and Xiao Xiao were in the back.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen ran ahead of Huo Yuhao, then turned her head back to look at Huo Yuhao, her cold gaze bearing a degree of curiosity and alertness.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao shrugged his shoulders towards her. Afterwards, both of his foolproof white soul rings of lit up once more. Just like before, his Spiritual Detection Sharing was activated when the moment that his first soul ring lit up.</p>
 <p>The people in front of him shuddered all simultaneously shuddered. If it weren’t for the fact that they were all well experienced in battle, they wouldn’t have been able to keep themselves from turning and staring at Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng and Chen Zifeng finally understood why Ma Xiaotao’s Phoenix Meteor Shower had been so accurate before. However, they hadn’t even thought that it had been due to Huo Yuhao. Weren’t his soul rings just white, ten year ones? How could he have such a powerful spiritual-type soul skill?! Furthermore, he’d previously used an ice-attribute martial soul, right? As such, how had this spiritual-type soul skill come about?</p>
 <p>Both parties were just over a hundred metres away from one another. It didn’t matter that Dai Yueheng, Chen Zifeng, and Ling Luochen had misgivings about this soul skill in their hearts, as they had to face their opponents first.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen was also a Control System Battle Soul Master. The cold stream that had previously surrounded her rose up once more. As it did, Ma Xiaotao appeared directly across from her. In that moment, her phoenix wings unfurled again, and with Gong Yangmo’s help, raging torrential flames appeared once more. The temperature in the assessment area rapidly began to increase.</p>
 <p>At that exact moment, Ling Luochen felt two warm palms suddenly press themselves against her back. She couldn’t help but shudder, which nearly interrupted her soul skill.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen was mysophobic, quiet, and cold. Besides her close relatives, she’d never let anyone from the opposite sex touch her body before. Amongst the three people standing behind her, the one directly behind her was Huo Yuhao. As such, this pair of hands undoubtedly belonged to Huo Yuhao. She was immediately enraged, but right when she was about to turn around and lash out at him, she suddenly felt that something about her soul skill had changed. It was difficult to describe the frigid air that had suddenly surged into her body from her back: Her ability was originally ice-based, thus this external force wasn’t an attack, but an assimilation. She felt that her ice had turned into an existence that stood on a completely different level than before, while her entire temperament seemed to have subsequently changed because of that frigid feeling.</p>
 <p>As one of Shrek Academy’s inner courtyard disciples, Ling Luochen wasn’t only stubbornly strong, she was also extremely knowledgeable when it came to soul masters. She immediately became aware of a possibility that had been unknown to her up until this point. When she thought of this possibility, she immediately understood why she’d previously lost to Huo Yuhao in such a dubious manner.</p>
 <p><em>Ultimate, it’s actually Ultimate Ice. This tiny youngster actually has an inconceivable martial soul like Ultimate Ice!</em></p>
 <p>Both parties began to near each other as Ling Louchen had this revelation. Ling Luochen quickly calmed down, then immediately confirmed that it was Huo Yuhao behind her. However, when she did, she noticed that his two soul rings had actually turned into a single soul ring. Wang Dong was right behind Huo Yuhao, and he‘d firmly planted both his hands on Huo Yuhao’s back as well. She was able to see all of this because of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection.</p>
 <p>Her ice element had turned into an Ultimate Ice element! To Ling Luochen, this feeling was both magical and wonderful. Even though this wouldn’t turn her into a true Ultimate Ice Soul Master, what Huo Yuhao had done was equivalent to amplifying her ice attribute for a short period of time, such that she could temporarily use the power of an Ultimate Ice attribute. Furthermore, Ultimate Ice that bore the power of a Soul King.</p>
 <p>Ling Luochen’s first soul ring metamorphosed into an icy staff, which she then raised over her head. However, she didn’t release her second soul ring and equip her ice armor this time around. Instead, she pointed her icy staff towards the sky. When she did, an icy blue halo encased her whole body in a split second, which caused body to be wrapped in an icy blue coat.</p>
 <p>Immediately afterwards, an icy blue pillar of light soared into the sky. The dry heat that had filled their surroundings was immediately swept into oblivion. Not only that, but once the icy cold draft had risen ten metres into the air, it rapidly spread like a tide and pressed itself against Ma Xiaotao’s phoenix flames.</p>
 <p>No matter how firm Dai Yueheng’s resolution was, he couldn’t help but look up at the sky. He just so happened to see an icy blue layer overtake both Chen Zifeng and himself at an astonishing speed. That icy blue layer then rapidly came into contact with Ma Xiaotao’s monstrous phoenix flames.</p>
 <p>When they felt the chilliness brought about by the Ultimate Ice, Dai Yueheng and Chen Zifeng couldn’t help but shiver, despite being her teammates. They exchanged a glance, the astonishment they felt clearly present in their eyes.</p>
 <p>All of them were within Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing, thus they could naturally tell that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong were both currently supporting Ling Luochen. Furthermore, the cold aura that Ling Luochen had revealed had completely surpassed that of the one she’d revealed in the past. The overwhelming pressure brought about by it shocked even a Soul Emperor like Dai Yueheng!</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao’s Reddish-golden flames rapidly collided with the icy blue streams of cold.</p>
 <p>The people on Ma Xiaotao’s team were startled to find that their deduction was wrong: The one currently winning wasn’t the Soul Emperor Ma Xiaotao, but rather the Soul King Ling Luochen.</p>
 <p>When the cold streams came into contact with the scorching phoenix flames, they seemed as though they’d suddenly encountered a downpour. The flames dissipated in the face of the cold streams, and were consequently replaced by the cold torrential streams. The cold streams of air shocked every single person on Ma Xiaotao’s team, and caused them to feel a little sluggish.</p>
 <p>Yao Haoxuan had already turned into an extremely brawny four-metre tall man, and he began forcefully thumping his chest. That was his first soul skill, ‘Warfare’.</p>
 <p>However, this yellow soul skill of his that strengthened everyone on his team wasn’t able to neutralize the chilliness they felt. Contrary to his expectations, he even slowed down a little.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Xiao Xiao’s Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute suddenly rang out. Under her precise control, the sound waves that caused people to slow down flew past her teammates without affecting them, only affecting the seven people on Ma Xiaotao’s team.</p>
 <p>Ma Xiaotao’s team was strong, but they had a problem—they didn’t have a real Control System Battle Soul Master on their team. Their opponents, on the other hand, had three of them.</p>
 <p>Under the joint efforts of Ling Luochen and Xiao Xiao, their seven-man team had now become significantly slower.</p>
 <p>Dai Yueheng and Chen Zifeng became fired up when they saw this. They suddenly felt that their loss wasn’t necessarily certain in this match, and both released their martial souls. They then simultaneously accelerated towards Ma Xiaotao. Ma Xiaotao was in a completely different situation this match, now that she didn’t have Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection Sharing to aid her. Furthermore, Ling Luochen was suppressing her phoenix flames.</p>
 <p>“Xi Xi, get rid of Huo Yuhao!” Ma Xiaotao shouted out as she faced Dai Yueheng and Chen Zifeng head-on without a shred fear in her body. Bei Bei and He Caitou flanked her from the sides, but a flash of lightning immediately sparked past all of them, which formed a refraction at an alarming speed; Xi Xi had already reached Huo Yuhao’s side only a second after Ma Xiaotao had shouted.</p>
 <p>Neither Ling Luochen’s cold streams nor Xiao Xiao’s Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute were capable of impairing Xi Xi’s speed by a large amount. She was Xi Xi: An ordinary-looking girl, yet a true assassin-like Agility System Soul Master!</p>
 <p>“Dong—” Lightning shot out in all directions amidst the prolonged sound that was produced from a collision. Xi Xi finally revealed her true self from within the lightning.</p>
 <p>In that moment, her pupils were vertical, while her skin had turned black, and lightning was currently coiling around body. That’s right, this was her martial soul—Lightning Leopard.</p>
 <p>However, someone had blocked that attack of hers, which she’d unleashed with the intention to win. It was only natural that Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong wouldn’t have been able to block her sudden attack head on, but there was someone who could: Xu Sanshi.</p>
 <p>His huge Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle had landed right in front of Huo Yuhao, which had caused Xi Xi to rebound from her attack. After her attack struck, Xu Sanshi positioned himself horizontally from her.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Dai Yueheng and Chen Zifeng were even more aware of the wonder brought about by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. They were able to completely grasp the situation on the battlefield in a three-dimensional form at all times due to his Spiritual Detection. Normally, a speedy assassin such as Xi Xi would dart behind their opponents and ambush them where they knew they’d appear. However, they didn’t make a detour to deal with Xi Xi this time around. Xu Sanshi’s obstruction had appeared in their Spiritual Detection, thus all they needed to do was face their opponents head-on.</p>
 <p>Both parties were about to collide with one another, when Dai Yueheng suddenly revealed a somewhat strange smile on his face. Following that, his fourth soul ring suddenly lit up.</p>
 <p>A bright, golden-white pillar of light soared into the sky. A brilliant, crescent-moon shaped light seemed to shine from within the light pillar. Shortly afterwards, tens of balls of light appeared from atop the light pillar and descended in a flash. They passed Ma Xiaotao by, then split into two groups. One group headed towards the sky-bound Gong Yangmo, while the other portion rapidly dispersed and shot towards Jiang Nannan and He Caitou.</p>
 <p><em>Who doesn’t know how to unleash a meteor shower? You have your Phoenix Meteor Shower, I have my White Tiger Meteor Shower. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth! It’s my turn to land a clean hit now that I have Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection on my side!</em></p>
 <p>If they were competing based purely on strength alone, Dai Yueheng naturally wouldn’t be able to compare to Ma Xiaotao’s six-ringed soul skill with just his four-ringed one. They were both Meteor Showers, but his was much weaker than hers. However, his meteor shower had a much smaller amount of meteors compared to Ma Xiaotao, which caused every single meteor of his to be more powerful in their own right. Moreover, the main target he’d chosen wasn’t the weakest amongst the three from the opposing team, but rather their team’s main attacker, Gong Yangmo. As long as he was able to get rid of Gong Yangmo, the strength of Ma Xiaotao’s team would plummet.</p>
 <p>Gong Yangmo had already released three soul skills at this point. The first soul skill he’d used was ‘Scarlet Strength’, the second was ‘Orange Soul’, and the third soul skill was ‘Yellow Speed’. These three soul skills caused three halos to appear atop the heads of everyone on his team, with Yao Haoxuan’s amplification then added onto them. Their party was now much stronger, and if one were to isolate their team and look at each individual’s current state they’d clearly be able to see this.</p>
 <p>However, the moment that both parties were about to engage in a close-quarters battle, Ling Luochen suddenly let out another attack.</p>
