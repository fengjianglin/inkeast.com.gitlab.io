His soul power kept on seeping out, but it couldn’t change the fact that he had been fatally wounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The life energy of a Titled Douluo was extremely terrifying. Even after suffering such a fatal injury, which was a result of the devouring power of the Golden Dragon Spear and the judgment of the Judgment Sword, Wang Yiheng was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had already regained a streak of his consciousness when the Mad Bull Douluo had completely unleashed his strength. He blocked Ji Juechen. Even though the two of them were flung away, Huo Yuhao took close to ninety percent of the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Solo Battle Armor played a crucial role at this moment. It was impossible for him to block the all-out attack of a Titled Douluo, but Wang Yiheng was unable to attack given the state he was in. He could only release whatever external strength he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao spat out a mouthful of blood, but he wasn’t too seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ji Juechen grabbed hold of him in the air. He didn’t thank Huo Yuhao, but only patted his shoulder.</span></p>

They watched as Wang Yiheng put up his final struggle. Right now, reinforcements from the Star Luo Empire had already arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke was personally here. There were also other Titled Douluo from their respective soul engineer legions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Star Luo Empire had too much information about Wang Yiheng, the leader of the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion. However, they still felt a little unbelieving that Wang Yiheng had been subjected to such fatal injuries right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the leader of the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion! He was actually surrounded and attacked by eight Soul Sages from Shrek Academy?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These Titled Douluo were confident of taking Wang Yiheng on in a close-combat fight. However, they also couldn’t deny that the survivability of a soul engineer of the same tier was stronger. Would Wang Yiheng have a lack of powerful soul tools on him? His Empyrean Blaze combined offense and defense. Furthermore, he had great control over his Empyrean Blaze. However, he still…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yiheng’s struggle lasted for a few minutes in the air before he finally dropped indignantly from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xu Sanshi was already back to his original form. He lifted his Golden Xuanwu Shield and his fourth soul ring flashed before he managed to drag Wang Yiheng’s corpse over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How precious was the corpse of a Class 9 soul engineer? No one knew. This was because there had never been a situation in the Sun Moon Empire’s history that the corpse of a Class 9 soul engineer had landed in an enemy’s hands. Wang Yiheng was the first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan was a little worried as she looked at Huo Yuhao. Right now, Huo Yuhao had already regained his awareness even though he was still bugged by the side effects of his Haodong Palm. He gently nodded to confirm that Wang Yiheng was already dead through his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great!” Nan Qiuqiu cheered and hugged Ye Guyi, who was beside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ye Guyi’s body suddenly became a little unstable. She almost couldn’t control her flying-type soul tool. Even though she could use her wings to fly, it was very draining on her soul power. Most of the time, she would use her flying-type soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jing Ziyan also wore a smile on her face. Ji Juechen looked as indifferent as ever, as if the last strike had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong calmly opened her dragon wings and drifted closer to Huo Yuhao. She didn’t seem to be affected by Wang Yiheng’s death. Right now, all of her attention was drawn to Huo Yuhao. Her gaze was focused, but no one could guess what she was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke led the other Titled Douluo as they came over. They first came beside Xu Sanshi and seriously checked Wang Yiheng’s condition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Titled Douluo who appeared to be in his sixties nodded before saying, “Yes, it’s Wang Yiheng, the leader of the Evil Tyrant Soul Engineer Legion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A look of delighted surprise soon appeared on the faces of the other Titled Douluo. This was probably the best outcome that the Star Luo Empire had achieved since the war had started. Even though the empire wasn’t really responsible for killing Wang Yiheng, such a result was good enough to boost the morale of the troops. It was a morale booster for all the deflated soul engineers who had witnessed the deaths of more than two thousand soul masters the last time around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke came beside Huo Yuhao and was a little perplexed as he looked at him. “Huo Yuhao, you should have left it to us this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao twisted his head to look at him, but didn’t say anything. There was an indifferent look in his eyes. He even appeared to be cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such an expression left the White Tiger Duke a little stunned. He couldn’t understand it. Furthermore, he also seemed to have seen something familiar in Huo Yuhao’s eyes. However, Huo Yuhao quickly shifted his gaze away immediately after their eyes met, and stopped looking at the White Tiger Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had unleashed his Haodong Palm, which was filled with his yearning for Wang Dong’er and his mother! At such a time, he was prone to losing control of his focus. In addition, Dai Hao was beside him. How could he possibly control his emotions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Nannan flew to Huo Yuhao’s side and apologetically said to the White Tiger Duke, “I’m sorry, Duke. Huo Yuhao unleashed his self-invented soul skill earlier and drained too much of his spiritual power. That has affected his emotions, and he’s still suffering the side effects of it. Please let him recover first. He’s not in his normal emotional state right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The White Tiger Duke was only enlightened at this point, and nodded gently. He replied, “Alright, let’s return first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the protection of the bunch of Titled Douluo, everyone turned around and proceeded in the direction of the Northwestern Field Army’s base. Very soon, they arrived back at their base.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After landing, Huo Yuhao had already recovered significantly. He turned to Xu Sanshi and said, “Third senior, hand the corpse over to the Duke, but grab his things first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wouldn’t be so foolishly generous. Everyone clearly knew that the accessories of a Class 9 soul engineer were very valuable. Wang Yiheng’s most valuable possession was undoubtedly his Empyrean Blaze. Earlier, all the pearls had fallen off. With Huo Yuhao’s spiritual senses, he informed Nan Qiuqiu and Ye Guyi of their rough locations before they went to retrieve them. It was impossible for them to give up possession of these pearls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for what the Mad Bull Douluo had on him earlier, no one knew. However, they would be a reward for Huo Yuhao and the rest. The White Tiger Duke had mentioned before that they could keep whatever they retrieved. If they were willing to sell them to the Star Luo Empire, the empire would buy them at market price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also why Huo Yuhao didn’t ask the White Tiger Duke to coordinate with them earlier. If the Northwestern Field Army’s Titled Douluo coordinated and reinforced them earlier, who would be the rightful owner of everything that they obtained from the Mad Bull Douluo?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The few Titled Douluo from the Star Luo Empire looked at one another and appeared a little discontented. This was the base of the Northwestern Field Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the White Tiger Duke’s expression didn’t change. He nodded and said, “Thanks, Yuhao. I’ll ask someone to record your contributions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little unwilling to look at him right now, and so he didn’t. He lifted his right hand, and a streak of blue light shot forward at the empty ground in front of him. Suddenly, a huge soul tool with a diameter of over two meters appeared in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…” All the Titled Douluo were surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao calmly said, “This is a high altitude aerial surveillance soul tool that belongs to the Sun Moon Empire. I’m going to give it to the Star Luo Empire. I hope that this will expedite the empire’s research on soul tools. I’m sorry, White Tiger Duke. I’m a little tired, and would like to go and rest first.”</span></p>
