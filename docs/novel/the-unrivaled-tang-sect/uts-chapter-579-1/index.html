 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from the soul rings that Huo Yuhao was familiar with him, there was an extra blood-red ninth soul ring on her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Holy Ghost Church had gone all-out to nurture her. They even gave her a hundred thousand year soul ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao opened his arms, and a beam of jade-blue light shot out from his backbone. It was his Ice Empress’ Wrath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red and jade-blue clashed in the air. It was a confrontation between Ultimate Ice and Ultimate Fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A deafening sound echoed, as if hot oil had been spilled onto ice and snow. A huge amount of fog rose instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao’s Fire Phoenix disappeared. The last shockwave from Ice Empress’ Wrath hit her, and caused her to shudder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In terms of cultivation, she was no longer as strong as Huo Yuhao. She wasn’t as strong as that fellow she had almost killed in a manic rage back at the lakeside of the Sea God’s Lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her body turned cold, and Ma Xiaotao went into a bit of a daze. However, the aura of Ultimate Ice was quickly expelled by the phoenix flames in her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimate Ice and Ultimate Fire were two extreme strengths. Since time immemorial, they suppressed each other. As for which way it went, it depended on the cultivation of their owners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her huge phoenix wings opened behind her back. She used her third soul skill, Soaring Phoenix. As her Soaring Phoenix grew stronger and stronger, Ma Xiaotao’s stature kept growing. Phoenix flames reached towards Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t fight her on land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao pointed his toes to the ground, as if he were about to shot into the sky. However, Ma Xiaotao was only filled with boundless killing intent and the innate desire to fight. Why would she be bothered where they were?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, Feng Ling was already not in a very good mental state. However, she was already much better compared to Ma Xiaotao. Ma Xiaotao was like a killing machine now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she opened her mouth, she spat out a beam of dark red fire towards Huo Yuhao. It was her first soul skill, Phoenix Fireline, which was enhanced by her Soaring Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only this, but her entire body also started to smoke with burning flames. Her entire body released an indescribable yet immense aura. Then, she unleashed her second soul skill, Phoenix Baptism.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had already beaten two evil soul masters. In terms of soul power cultivation, both Feng Ling and Wu Yun were above Ma Xiaotao. However, Huo Yuhao felt more strained when he fought Ma Xiaotao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason was very simple. Ma Xiaotao was in a manic state right now. Furthermore, her Ultimate Fire didn’t fear Huo Yuhao’s Ultimate Ice. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao didn’t dare to go heavy on her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Given these restraints, Huo Yuhao was unable to fully unleash his abilities. Naturally, he was under some pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao took in a deep breath. He lifted his right hand and grabbed towards the Phoenix Fireline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A layer of diamond ice crystals surfaced on Huo Yuhao’s Icy War God’s Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ultimate Ice and Divine Ice Crystals, which were used to build the Icy War God’s Armor, were complementary. In terms of cultivation, Huo Yuhao was far superior to Ma Xiaotao, as he was enhanced by his Icy War God’s Armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice Empress’ Pincer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Phoenix Fireline was blocked, but Huo Yuhao was also astonished to find out that the diamond ice crystals on his Ice Empress’ Pincer were about to melt under the attack of Ma Xiaotao’s Phoenix Skyline. This was unthinkable. There was a huge gap between their cultivations. Why was Ma Xiaotao’s Phoenix Fireline so strong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Huo Yuhao was astonished, Ma Xiaotao had already turned into a Fire Phoenix and flew towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was still using her Phoenix Skywhistle. The only difference was that her second and third soul skills, the Phoenix Baptism and Soaring Phoenix, enhanced her Phoenix Skywhistle this time. It was even stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted. An icy-blue halo spread from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Star Anise Ice Origin! It was a soul skill that originated from the Star Anise Mysterious Ice Grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, Huo Yuhao wasn’t in his best state right now. This was because his six Spirits were all in deep sleep. He was affected without his Spirits. He could only use the powers that belonged to his Spirits. There were even some special abilities he couldn’t use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, he couldn’t use the complete version of the Pride of the Ice and Snow Empresses when both the Ice and Snow Empress were asleep. At the same time, he couldn’t use his Ultimate Ice True Body too. The Ice Empress was asleep. If he used the Ice Empress’ True Body, he couldn’t possibly unleash its essence. This was not to even mention that the Ultimate Ice True Body also depended on tapping into the Snow Empress’ strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even so, Huo Yuhao was still considered one of the strongest in the world of soul masters because of his Ultimate martial soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the effect of the Star Anise Icy Origin, his Icy War God’s Armor dazzled. He punched out a fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just his fist; he didn’t use any soul skills. However, at this instant, Huo Yuhao seemed to have fused with heaven and earth. Ma Xiaotao, who was against him, seemed to be subjected to the wrath of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cluck——” Ma Xiaotao’s Phoenix Fireline was forcefully crushed, and she was thrown back. Her entire body seemed to be covered by a layer of diamond ice crystals. Even her Class 9 defensive-type soul tool on her wrist shone brightly. Evidently, it was taking effect. It was helping her resist Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Liwu had only just dispelled the Ultimate Ice soul power in Feng Ling’s body right now. When he saw this scene, his expression changed completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That fist contained the principles of heaven and earth! He got the same feeling from his mother’s body. However, it wasn’t as intense. He also sensed that from Long Xiaoyao’s body, which was a little stronger than his mother. Di Tian was the one who left him the deepest impression when it came to this feeling. It was just that Di Tian was a soul beast, and didn’t seem to be able to completely fuse with heaven and earth. However, Huo Yuhao appeared to have originated from heaven and earth when he unleashed his fist earlier! He didn’t use a lot of his soul power, but Ma Xiaotao was greatly disadvantaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t try to call out to Ma Xiaotao at this moment. This was because he was clearly aware that she was greatly poisoned. She wouldn’t respond so easily. He needed to save her first before he had a chance to neutralize the toxins and wake her up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first thing he had to do before he could save her was defeat her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights flashed, and Huo Yuhao revealed a determined and serious look on his face. He forced Ma Xiaotao back with one fist, and felt the undulations coming from the two soul cores in his body becoming a little more intense. The slight collision between his soul cores generated a whirlpool of soul power that seemed to strengthen the impact of his fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven was Yang, and Earth was Yin. Yin and Yang complemented each other according to the principles of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this was the origin of his fist earlier. It was a perfect combination of his spiritual and Ultimate Ice soul power. If there was something lacking, it could only be emotions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, it was emotions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was before he met the God of Emotions Nian Rongbing, Huo Yuhao would perhaps not know why his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills were so strong. After that, he realized that it was because they fused his emotions. Soul skills without emotions were like soul skills without souls. The strength of a soul determined the potential and power of a soul skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Three Ultimate Haodong Skills were only so strong because they perfectly unleashed all his emotions. They were so strong that he could defeat an opponent that was much stronger than him in terms of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was much stronger than before; even compared to if he hadn’t fused his emotions into his self-invented skill. When he unleashed this fist, his understanding of his Yin-Yang Complement twin soul cores suddenly deepened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ang!” A sonorous phoenix roar sounded. A huge fire phoenix appeared in the air. It was the Phoenix True Body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ma Xiaotao didn’t know what fear was in her manic state. There was only one thing in her mind right now, which was to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she revealed her Phoenix True Body, she charged towards Huo Yuhao. The sky distorted, and there seemed to be an extra layer of ripples high up in the sky. The earth also distorted. The temperature turned terrifyingly high, and caused the battlefield to burn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Countless scorching meteors formed in the sky before they shot towards Huo Yuhao. This was Ma Xiaotao’s sixth soul skill, Phoenix Meteor Shower!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Against this soul skill, Huo Yuhao was feeling very touched. A long time ago, Ma Xiaotao used this skill to help them win the championship during the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he could still clearly remember how strong Ma Xiaotao was back then, how awe-inspiring she was. When he saw this soul skill again, he was very touched, even though the meteor shower was coming towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snowflakes drifted once again. Ice turned into spikes and bloomed like icy flowers in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Star Anise Omnithrust!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every spike accurately hit a meteor. When ice and fire clashed, ice melted, and fire became weaker. Dazzling lights also turned into dazzling fireworks in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps this fight wasn’t the most dangerous compared to the previous two fights, but it was certainly the most eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Star Anise Omnithrust managed to resist the Phoenix Meteor Shower. However, the Phoenix True Body was still charging towards Huo Yuhao with the Phoenix Skypierce.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Undoubtedly, the best way for Huo Yuhao to react right now was to use his Ice Jade Empress’ Scorpion True Body. Even without the Ice Empress’ help, he was still confident of suppressing Ma Xiaotao using his Ultimate Ice True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he didn’t do so. The reason was very simple. Ice and fire were two extremes. This was even more so between Ultimate Ice and Ultimate Fire. He was worried that he would hurt Ma Xiaotao using such extreme methods. If that happened, he would be regretful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since his mother had died, Huo Yuhao had no close relatives. When he came to Shrek Academy, he seemed to have found his home. Ma Xiaotao also became like his biological elder sister. Even though they didn’t spend a lot of time together, Huo Yuhao still considered her to be very important in his life.</span></p>
