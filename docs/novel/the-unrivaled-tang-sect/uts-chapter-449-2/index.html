 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

Huo Yuhao could feel both intense excitement and anxiety, and his senses were elevated continuously in this moment – he could even feel that his potential was being unleashed continuously under such circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It’d be fantastic if I could continue in such a state.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao understood that his cultivation would probably improve once more after he succeeded in this mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two thousand meters, a thousand eight hundred meters, a thousand five hundred meters, a thousand three hundred meters, a thousand two hundred meters!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao paused when he was a thousand two hundred meters away from the main peak. He wasn’t hasty to push forward, and neither did he release any Spiritual Detection. Instead, he relied only on his eyes to look up at the peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Spirit Eyes were at the highest possible level of the Purple Demon Eyes even without support from his spiritual power. He could see many things clearly in the darkness, even from a thousand two hundred meters away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao discovered that there were not that many soul tools installed on the Ming Dou Mountain Range’s main peak. Instead, there relatively more soul tools installed on the two peaks beside it. A large region of the main peak’s tip was covered by metal, and there were many strange-looking metal shells constructed on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These metal shells were undoubtedly the best cover for the soul tools within. Huo Yuhao memorized every single one of their positions in his heart. Even if his mission failed in the end, memorizing these positions accurately would still be very useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he relied on his own observations to judge where the Death God was located. He was scouting out the Death God, and it would be best if he could damage or destroy it, as that was the most important aim of his expedition!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Death God wasn’t difficult to find. Huo Yuhao quickly saw the hemispherical metal dome on the main peak’s tip. This metal dome was about ten meters in diameter, and it was completely metal grey in color. It wasn’t eye-catching or obvious at all whether it was day or night, but Huo Yuhao could feel his soul shaking when he saw it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s senses were still very perceptive even though the metal dome wasn’t releasing any soul power undulations.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is this? It’s clearly a terrifying pressure naturally produced by something terrifying! It should be there. I will have completed half of my task if I can get close to it</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.</span></p>

The Death God was better at attacking from long range no matter how powerful it was, and it wasn’t all-powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao took a deep breath and began to move once more. He held his breath, and edged forward bit by bit. Rose-gold colors flickered in his Eye of Destiny as he stared at what was in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spiritual barrier didn’t have any shape or form, and even Huo Yuhao couldn’t detect the spiritual barrier using his spiritual power without touching it. However, he would immediately be discovered if he touched it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thousand two hundred meters, a thousand one hundred meters, a thousand and fifty meters…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pushed on bit by bit, until he was almost there. Huo Yuhao paused when he was about a thousand and twenty meters away from the main peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had relied entirely on his memory from his previous expedition to reach this point, but he was unable to be sure about the last few dozen meters. He was taking a risk, so he decided to keep his risk within a controllable range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao quietly removed the leather wings on his body, and a faint smile appeared on his face. He had originally thought that he would need a lot more effort to close the gap, as there were likely to be oscillation detectors on the mountaintop, after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Sun Moon Empire was evidently very confident after transforming the surveillance soul tools on the outer layer. The mountain’s oscillation detectors were all placed on the outside, and there were no other surveillance soul tools on the inside except for the spiritual barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Eye of Destiny became increasingly bright as Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power flourished more and more. The light around Huo Yuhao began to contort faintly as large amounts of spiritual power were unleashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Spiritual Blast!” A low growl came out of Huo Yuhao’s mouth. The air in front of him began to sizzle as if it were boiling, and soundless booms abruptly exploded within ten meters around him – this was a spiritual-type attack with an area of effect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The spiritual barrier that was hidden one thousand meters from the main peak was finally triggered. It released a dull hum as it appeared roughly ten meters away from Huo Yuhao. The spiritual barrier rippled intensely under the effects of his Spiritual Blast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brrng! Brrng!” Shrill alarm sounds immediately rang out on the mountaintop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s expression didn’t change. At this point in time, there was no longer any meaning in using Imitation to conceal his position. Gold and purple light flashed in his Eye of Destiny on his forehead, and a purplish-gold beam of light blasted out from it as the sky was gradually tinted rose-gold, while blinding light collided ferociously with the spiritual barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One had to know that the Manic Bull Douluo Wang Yiheng took a big hit back then from Huo Yuhao’s attack, and his defensive spiritual-type soul tool was directly shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the spiritual barrier around the Ming Dou Mountain Range’s main peak was powerful, the main problem with it was that it covered an area that was far too large. Therefore, any localized position’s defensive strength couldn’t reach the standard of a Class 9 soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Woosh—” A hole that was one meter in diameter appeared on the spiritual barrier as it popped open like a pierced balloon. However, this spiritual barrier was impressive – it swiftly stretched out to cover the gaps after it had been broken through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly let such an opportunity go, and light spurted from his flying-type soul tool as he transformed into a beam of light and darted through the hole he had created. He didn’t touch the spiritual barrier at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s life could end in an instant as he came within one thousand meters of the main peak! How could he allow himself to be dazed after touching the spiritual barrier?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light glowed on the main peak, and even the stones began to shift in some places. Metal shells split open on the mountaintop, revealing the soul tools inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t have to use Spiritual Detection to feel that large amounts of soul tools were locked onto him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Beams of light instantly began to twist around Huo Yuhao’s body – Spiritual Interference!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three pairs of wings on his back roared at maximum capacity at the same time, and he channeled as much soul power as he could. In addition to the two rows of soul thrusters firing off, everything propelled him like a shooting star as he went directly for the main peak. He was going right for the Death God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stretched out his Spiritual Detection to every corner once he was inside the spiritual barrier. His main target was still the mountaintop – he wanted to see what the Death God was exactly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A conical soul tool gradually protruded from within the hemispherical shell. This soul tool was dark red, and the light from all the soul tools around it seemed to dim in the moment that it appeared. Frightening soul power undulations rippled out from it, and once Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power touched it, an intense and piercing pain appeared deep in his spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao howled in agony, and was almost unable to control himself as he nearly fell. He retracted his Spiritual Detection as if he had just touched red-hot metal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time that Huo Yuhao had experienced something like this; he didn’t cut such a sorry figure even when he was facing the Beast God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That… that is…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao effortfully channeled his soul and spiritual power as his expression changed to one of terror, and at the same time, he tried his best to keep his balance.</span></p>

Large masses of soul rays and cannon shells blanketed toward Huo Yuhao – they didn’t care about his Spiritual Interference Domain, they just launched attacks over an enormous area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao retracted his Spiritual Detection very quickly. Even though that intense pain was still splitting his head open, he couldn’t care about that at this moment. He kept his Spiritual Detection within a certain range around his body as he flickered continuously. He didn’t charge forward toward the main peak anymore – instead, he swiftly plummeted downward; evading all those fatal attacks first was the wisest move!</span></p>

His body still slowed a little, and he still didn’t evade one of the soul rays. That soul ray struck the side of his arm, and the hit made him spin in midair like a top.</span></p>

Otherwise, no matter how powerful he was, he would have been injured from that hit.</span></p>

In this moment, the dark red pointy tower was completely erect as faint dark red light rotated around it. However, it didn’t fire at him. It was clear that, for the person who was controlling the Death God, Huo Yuhao was not worthy of firing the Death God.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Huo Yuhao was placed at a complete disadvantage and was about to use Instant Teleportation to diffuse the situation, a purple beam of light suddenly glowed from behind his back as a series of crackling sounds appeared in the sky. A patch of soul cannon shells that were sweeping over were detonated as they exploded in a patch in the sky. A gentle strength pulled on Huo Yuhao and dragged him horizontally, out of the explosions’ epicenter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A slender figure appeared from thin air behind him, and Huo Yuhao was stunned speechless when he looked up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The person who had suddenly appeared to save him was, to his immense surprise, Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was very glamorous in this moment as her Radiant Dragon Butterfly’s wings stretched out behind her. There was no doubt that she was the one who had released that purple light.</span></p>

Not in his wildest dreams did he expect that Tang Wutong would follow him here. However, he didn’t sense anything at all before this! This was just unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tang Wutong giggled and said, “That’s nothing. I have an innate skill, and I followed you inside – that’s all. You would have been target practice if it hadn’t been for me. What do we do next?”</span></p>
