 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong lifted her left hand, and a pitch-black hammer with golden patterns appeared in her hand. She shook her wrist, and her Clear Sky Hammer hammered the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sonic blast sounded. Within a hundred meters, all plants were decimated. A huge depression was even created in the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling groaned and spat out fresh blood. Her eyes were filled with horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Tang Wutong waved that hammer, she only felt that the air had consolidated and turned into a huge hammer a hundred meters in diameter. After this, the huge hammer struck her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dark Phoenix’s flames scattered and disappeared. Her legs also collapsed into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She couldn’t resist at all as her powers were completely suppressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s staff was already in his hand. Avenging spirits started to rise around him. No matter what, he was still a Rank 98 Titled Douluo. He couldn’t wait and watch as he was killed. What he had to do was delay his death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Death God Demonpuppet’s shadow appeared behind him. Avenging spirits then appeared. They started to burn as they cried tragically, turning into balls of fire. After this, they were devoured by the Death God Demonpuppet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu already looked very ferocious right now. Feng Ling looked up into the sky and roared. She instantly turned into a black Fire Phoenix. As she roared, she unleashed a strong spiritual blast. She was unleashing her True Body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dragon wings opened up behind Tang Wutong as she summoned the Golden Dragon Spear with her right hand. After this, she pointed it at Zhongli Wu while she waved her hammer in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every time the Dark Phoenix wanted to get close to her, she would immediately be flung away by invisible air currents. Every time she was hammered, the flames on her body would immediately weaken. This was a difference in absolute power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sunlight behind Tang Wutong got stronger and stronger. A strong aura of light illuminated Zhongli Wu’s body, such that he started to smoke. However, he tolerated the pain. His Death God Demonpuppet became more and more real as the flames of avenging spirits were continuously poured into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu’s strength came from these avenging spirits, but right now, he actually burned all of them. This showed that he was going all-out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was standing not far away from Tang Wutong. However, he appeared very relaxed. He was just acting as an audience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the strong aura released by the Dark Phoenix stopped in mid-air after it forcibly resisted Tang Wutong’s hammer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling’s original form was slowly revealed. She looked very pale, and she spat out fresh blood. Her body also started to burn. It wasn’t just her soul power that had been combusted. The power of her soul was also burning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wutong, be careful.” Huo Yuhao warned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Feng Ling was the vice-sect leader of the Holy Ghost Church by name, she was in fact being controlled by Zhongli Wu. For him, she was willing to burn her own soul and martial soul. It didn’t seem like it was on her willing part.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling screamed tragically into the sky. Her body suddenly turned into a huge ball of black-red fire. After this, she instantly fused with her own phoenix flames. Suddenly, the Fire Phoenix turned completely black. She fluttered her wings with force. This time, she blocked Tang Wutong’s Clear Sky Hammer. After this, she fell from the sky, not towards Tang Wutong, but towards Zhongli Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold smile appeared on Huo Yuhao’s face. Without a doubt, Feng Ling and Zhongli Wu were unleashing a secret spell of the Holy Ghost Church. As for what the effect would be, Huo Yuhao was unclear. However, he knew that it should be rather powerful, since it involved burning both Feng Ling and Zhongli Wu’s avenging spirits as the price to pay. Perhaps it might temporarily offer them the powers of an Ultimate Douluo. After all, the powers of evil soul masters were rather weird and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, how would Huo Yuhao give Zhongli Wu an opportunity to do so?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure flashed, and he came in front of Tang Wutong. He opened his arms wide and hugged her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A grin appeared on Tang Wutong’s face. Her dragon wings reversed and engulfed Huo Yuhao. Following this, their bodies shone brightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A vertical eye that shone with strange lights silently appeared. Gold, jade-green, dark blue, deep purple and other colors flashed and alternated within this vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next instant, a beam of light that fused many different shades of colors shot out from the vertical eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had to grasp the perfect timing. When he finally hugged Tang Wutong, it was just when Feng Ling and Zhongli Wu fused. At this moment, Zhongli Wu couldn’t possibly move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strange, multi-colored beam of light caused the vast region of space around it to be illuminated with a layer of strange light as it shot out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu turned dark-red as Feng Ling fused with him. His Death God Demonpuppet was fusing with his real body, and his aura was rapidly becoming stronger and stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was at this moment that the multi-colored beam of light was in front of him. Zhongli Wu only felt his entire body shaking. After this, he felt as if the entire world had become different. He felt weirdly relaxed. It was a relaxation that came from deep within his heart. It was very comfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he could no longer feel his immense soul power. The Death God Demonpuppet seemed to have been snatched from him. His entire body became a golden statue. His immense power instantly vanished, like melting ice and snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the Golden Road Amidst Withering Resplendence, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s powerful fusion skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fusion skill unleashed by two individuals who were close to being Ultimate Douluo had in fact transcended the boundaries of this world. It was at the tier of demigods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how strong the secret spell Zhongli Wu and Feng Ling had used was, how could it compare to the near-godly strength of Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s attack?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feng Ling’s strength disappeared along with her soul. No traces were left behind. Zhongli Wu’s Death God Demonpuppet was also snatched away. Even his soul power was halved. When he struggled to escape, it felt as if he was older by tens of years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s powers changed, their Golden Road also changed. The withering didn’t just happen on martial souls and soul skills. It also happened on life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu was already very old. After he was subjected to this Golden Road, his life energy was greatly drained. He seemed like an old man who was on the verge of death right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Impossible, this is impossible. This is power that doesn’t belong to humans. Even if it’s my mother or Elder Long, they don’t possess such strength. Why is it they can demonstrate such power?” Zhongli Wu whined. He didn’t even use his last trick before he was already completely destroyed. This was too heavy of a blow to him, as the price he had to pay was his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beams and beams of light shot from the distance and only stopped when they were in front of Huo Yuhao. After this, they turned into balls of light and separately fused with his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhongli Wu appeared even more grim when he saw these lights. Since his Spirits were back, it also meant that all the powerful individuals from the Holy Ghost Church were dealt with. None of them was alive anymore. The Holy Ghost Church was really wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huo Yuhao! &nbsp;You destroyed my Holy Ghost Church. Even if I become a ghost, I won't let you off.” Zhongli Wu was filled with hatred as he looked at Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and said, “It’s a pity. You can’t even become a ghost. You’ve harmed too many people in this life. Even if you become a ghost or an avenging spirit, you’ll still be punished by the heavens. However, I won’t give you that chance out of respect for Elder Long and Elder Ye Xishui. Do you think that you still can become a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Huo Yuhao’s eyes turned golden. He slowly walked towards Zhongli Wu. His immense spiritual power turned into a huge barrier, engulfing them. As his terrifying spiritual undulations spread, they were capable of disabling the spiritual strength Zhongli Wu possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the entire area shook tremendously. Terrifying spiritual power descended from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A low-pitched, dominant, and cold voice echoed in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who is it? How dare you disturb my sleep. Who dares to carry out a massacre in the Evildemon Forest?” As this voice sounded, the sky actually distorted and turned dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pitch-black clouds started to crack. It was as if the entire sky had cracked open. A huge eye appeared in mid-air, focused on where Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong and Zhongli Wu were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sovereign, you’re finally here! Please punish these two who are here to disturb the peace of the Evildemon Forest!” Zhongli Wu screamed hysterically. The reinforcements he had been waiting for finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes, this was the Holy Ghost Church’s final backer. If not for the permission that the Evileye Tyrant King gave, how would the Holy Ghost Church have been allowed to set up their headquarters in the Evildemon Forest? Even though it was only at the edge of the forest, it showed the relationship they shared with the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao around, they had the right to negotiate with the Evileye Tyrant King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the Holy Ghost Church wouldn’t have resorted to moving if not for the fact that Ye Xishui and Long Xiaoyao felt that their lives were about to reach their end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Evileye Tyrant King wasn’t some kind soul. Once the Holy Ghost Church could no longer stand at the same footing as him, he would definitely not mind them being destroyed. This was even though the Holy Ghost Church had given him a lot of benefits over the past few years. The Evildemon Forest was his territory. Of course he wouldn’t want any humans to remain here.</span></p>
