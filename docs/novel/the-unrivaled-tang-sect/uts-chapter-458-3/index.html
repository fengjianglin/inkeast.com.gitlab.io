<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power didn’t weaken in the slightest as he continued to pour out his soul power. Elder Xuan was stunned to discover that the spiritual power surrounding the solid soul power was getting stronger and stronger. It had even turned from the original gold to rose-gold. It was like a layer of solid spiritual power existed and maintained the stability of the solid soul power perfectly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual power is really strong. It seems like I have underestimated the strength of his spiritual power. It is much stronger than I expected. Perhaps this kid’s spiritual cultivation has improved recently?...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan was right. After experiencing the war between the Star Luo Empire and Sun Moon Empire, Huo Yuhao was even personally involved in a fight between Ultimate Douluo. His body had suffered critical injuries, but he had developed a deeper understanding of spiritual aspects. After all, the spiritual power of two Ultimate Douluo were far stronger than his. Under the kind of pressure that he faced, his spiritual power naturally grew as it was stimulated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this tier, even a minor increase in his spiritual power was still a huge improvement!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The terrifying soul power undulations continued, and Huo Yuhao started to find it a little overwhelming. He could still hold on in terms of his spiritual power, but the solid soul power was absorbing his soul power at a faster speed, and the amount of soul power in his body was now less than that in the form of the solid soul power. Huo Yuhao only felt as if the soul power in his body was rushing out, while the revolution of the solid soul power had reached a speed that he couldn’t see properly even with his Spirit Eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fifty percent, sixty percent, seventy percent. When more than seventy percent of his soul power had been absorbed from his body, Huo Yuhao couldn’t control the output of his soul power any longer. What he couldn’t see was that the entire Sea God’s Pavilion had already let out a dim golden light. Above the Sea God’s Pavilion, origin energy had already formed clouds in the air. Immense origin energy continuously gathered in the direction of the Golden Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some of the elders in the Sea God’s Pavilion were awakened from their cultivation at this moment. How could they possibly not notice such a great disturbance in the pavilion?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is someone trying to become a Transcendent Douluo?,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">was their immediate reaction. Something as strange as this only appeared when someone was trying to form a soul core!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this, they discovered that the core of all the soul power undulations came from Elder Xuan’s room. This wasn’t considered a very impressive level of soul power undulations to them. Instead, they thought that the undulations were a little weak. There should be a greater disturbance if it was a Titled Douluo trying to become a Transcendent Douluo?...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they weren’t worried, since everything was happening in Elder Xuan’s room. After observing for a while, they all returned to meditate. The concentrated origin energy in the air was actually very beneficial to their cultivation. However, the prerequisite was that they had to create a barrier around themselves to prevent their soul power from being sucked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">----</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eighty percent! More than eighty percent of Huo Yuhao’s soul power had been devoured. Right now, he needed to use a portion of his spiritual power to control his entire body, so that his soul power would leak out at a slower speed. Perspiration had already drenched his forehead, and he started to look paler and paler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Elder Xuan was very impressed that Huo Yuhao was still able to stabilize and control the solid soul power even under such conditions. It did not shift at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, something strange happened. The original milky-white solid soul power started to change color, and turned a dim gold. Furthermore, this golden color was intensifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After seeing this, Elder Xuan was astonished. He lifted his head to look at Huo Yuhao. Although Huo Yuhao was already finding it very tough right now, he was still trying his best to hold on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhao, hang on. Your solid soul power is starting to develop elemental characteristics. Perhaps you can really construct a soul core. Your situation is different. If you manage to construct a soul core right now, you might actually reach the Rank 89 bottleneck in a much shorter period of time. Although it’s still difficult to become a Titled Douluo, this might be your opportunity. Hang on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing Elder Xuan’s words, Huo Yuhao was slightly stunned. He continued to use his spiritual power to control the remaining soul power in his body from being sucked out too quickly. This was because the solid soul power was not just absorbing his soul power; it was also absorbing the origin energy in the air. If it sucked less soul power from him, it could absorb more of the origin energy in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, Huo Yuhao had the deepest awareness of this solid soul power, since he was the one who had created it. He could clearly feel that the development of elemental characteristics was on the spiritual level. This meant that this solid soul power contained the spiritual power of his Spirit Eyes. It was fusing with his first martial soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual power kept on growing. His soul power couldn’t compare to a Titled Douluo, but his spiritual power could. Under the effect of his Eye of Destiny, he continued to let out more spiritual power from his body, and his Eye of Destiny also turned rose-gold. An aura of destiny started to appear as he let out his spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The revolution of his solid soul power continued to speed up. It was slowly turning golden. Apart from the immense soul power undulations, there were also decently strong undulations of spiritual power appearing. The spiritual power that Huo Yuhao unleashed to protect the solid soul power had even stuck to it, and was being devoured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the solid soul power slowed down its drawing of origin energy from the air and Huo Yuhao. This gave Huo Yuhao an opportunity to catch his breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I must hang on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao recognized that his abilities were lacking as he faced off against stronger individuals. He was clearly aware that his current cultivation was still not good enough to challenge individuals of higher cultivations. He had to work hard in his cultivation and increase his abilities right now. Elder Xuan had mentioned that this was a great opportunity, which was also what he had thought earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for a future, second soul core, it wasn’t impossible for him to form it, even if it was difficult. In addition, he had another thought. If he could hang on and wait until his solid soul power formed a soul core, it might even be a stepping stone for him to form a second soul core in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden color turned more and more intense. The aura of his Spirit Eyes had already completely pervaded his solid soul power. However, Huo Yuhao’s soul power had already been drained such that there was only a little left over. He gritted his teeth and hung on. However, he couldn’t just hold on because of the void in his body. He was trembling slightly. Without some soul power to support his body, his ability to let out spiritual power would also be affected!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Xuan furrowed his brow. He couldn’t help Huo Yuhao in the formation of his soul core. It could only be completed by the soul master himself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like Yuhao won’t be able to hang on! After all, his cultivation is too weak. Even if he has twin martial souls, his soul power is still not at the level of a Titled Douluo. Haih, it seems like pure spiritual power is still insufficient to complete the formation of a soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he should be proud of himself for what he’s achieved. After all, I was Rank 88 when I reached his standard in the past. He’s only Rank 70 or so right now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow light that Elder Xuan released was getting stronger and stronger. He was ready to intervene. When Huo Yuhao couldn’t hang on anymore, he would use his soul power to cage in Huo Yuhao’s solid soul power before sending it high up into the air and detonating it. In this way, there shouldn’t be much danger. However, Huo Yuhao would need a few days to recover after this experience. The drainage of his soul and spiritual power wasn’t something that he could easily recover from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s body was already shaking tremendously by now. He was relying on his willpower to hang on. The immense suction force kept on pulling his body forward. Once he couldn’t hang on anymore, he might even be sucked in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soul master couldn’t possibly carry out such an experiment on his own, because the end result was death. A soul master needed someone strong to protect him. A Soul Douluo had some ability to protect himself, since his soul power had already reached a certain standard. Even so, there were many cases of Soul Douluo getting critically hurt when they tried to become a Titled Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Elder Xuan was ready to intervene, a beam of golden light shone behind Huo Yuhao’s back, then a ball of milky-white light drilled out from his back. At the same time, a circular barrier appeared in front of him, helping to isolate the suction force of the solid soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Life Reflection Shield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ball of milky-white light that appeared slowly took form and transformed into a huge iceworm. Rings of subtle golden light patterns appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment it appeared, a wave of pure soul power poured into Huo Yuhao’s body, stabilizing him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brother Skydream!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao naturally knew the origin of this force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Skydream Iceworm’s voice sounded in his head, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Continue. I’m here</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment his voice was heard, the Life Reflection Shield disappeared, and the suction force was felt again, but with the support of the Skydream Iceworm, Huo Yuhao managed to recover slightly. The soul power that the Skydream Iceworm poured into his body contained concentrated spiritual power. As it was released, the solid soul power’s color intensified even more quickly. The gold turned brighter. Spatial cracks also started to appear around it.</span></p>
