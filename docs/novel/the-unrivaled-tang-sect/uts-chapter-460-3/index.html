 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “For instance, like this.” He stared at Nan Qiuqiu, and his eyes suddenly became deep and profound. Nan Qiuqiu felt as if there were a black maelstrom in each of his eyes, and she could feel an indescribable and terrifying pressure emanating from his body that locked her body down in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She could feel a tremble from her own spirit, and was terrified as she subconsciously gathered her soul power to resist that pressure. However, she quickly realized that her attempt was futile, because that pressure didn’t come from soul power at all! It was pure spiritual power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the spiritual pressure was so strong that she couldn’t even speak. Her flying-type soul tool became unstable as well, and she teetered in midair and seemed like she was going to plummet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pressure was suddenly lifted, and Nan Qiuqiu felt as if an enormous mountain had been lifted from her body. She panted with deep breaths as she tried her best to control her flying-type soul tool. She glared at Huo Yuhao and said, “Are you crazy? Are you trying to kill me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “This is the most effective method to train your spiritual power. If, at any moment, you can successfully resist my spiritual pressure, then your own will have reached a certain standard. Training like this is very hard to come by. Didn’t you feel like you were very bored along the way? Then I will take this chance to help you. We’re not in a hurry, anyway.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t…” She couldn’t even say “want” when the enormous spiritual pressure that had just disappeared descended onto her once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Nan Qiuqiu was a little more prepared than before, she was caught still off-guard in front of Huo Yuhao’s formidable spiritual power. This time, she was so badly beaten that she plummeted straight towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao grabbed Nan Qiuqiu at an appropriate time in midair, and made sure that she wouldn’t fall to her death. He waited for her to regain control of her body and stabilize herself before the spiritual pressure came back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not fighting back anymore. Throw me to my death if you dare!” Nan Qiuqiu was furious after this repeated itself a few more times!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She felt extremely fatigued after those episodes of immense spiritual pressure. She didn’t even bother to fly as she just allowed herself to drop down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had no choice but to catch her and land on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu kicked at Huo Yuhao as they dropped to the ground. Huo Yuhao dodged lightly towards the side and said, “I’m doing this for your own good, Qiuqiu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Psh. You’re trying to take this opportunity to get back at me!” Nan Qiuqiu glared at Huo Yuhao with an indignant look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao frowned slightly and said, “Looks like I was wrong about you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was momentarily stunned. “Wrong about me? What are you wrong about me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao continued, “I have always believed you were a very strong lady. If others can’t bear this method of training spiritual power, I’m sure you can. This is very beneficial for you becoming a Titled Douluo in the future. I didn’t expect you not to be able to take it after these few times. You’re no different from a typical little girl. Forget it,I won’t give you any more pressure. Meditate and rest up, and once you’ve rested up, we shall hurry towards the Earthdragon Sect.” He gave her a disappointed expression as he spoke and turned his head to one side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu frowned as he eyebrows went almost vertical. “Who says I can’t take it? I can take it! But… but you’re so evil! Are you targeting me deliberately?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao snapped back. “I’m not so frivolous. I wouldn’t be willing even if someone else begged me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu grunted and said, “Alright, then let me recover. Don’t think you can overcome me when I’m prepared.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao twitched his lips and shot back, “Prove it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu crossed her legs and began to recover with a competitive heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled faintly as he watched her enter meditation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Provoking this girl is the way to go! She’ll probably be tricked even if she knows I’m trying to bait her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">-------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Earthdragon Sect had taken out their most important belongings to establish close cooperation with the Tang Sect. Bei Bei had told Huo Yuhao privately that the Tang Sect had to find some way to repay them if possible. The Earthdragon Sect wasn’t considered a top-tier sect amongst the sects on the continent, but they were still considered a very old and powerful sect. The Earthdragon Sect had provided much help to the Tang Sect in terms of resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, with Nan Shuishui’s support, the Tang Sect’s middle to high level strength had been bolstered. The Earthdragon Sect’s several hundred disciples still belonged to the Earthdragon Sect in name, but Nan Shuishui had already expressed generously that the Earthdragon Sect would fully support the Tang Sect if anything happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the Tang Sect reciprocated the Earthdragon Sect’s sincerity. Almost a third of the Earthdragon Sect’s disciples had successfully fused with Spirits, which was a very laudable accomplishment amongst the sects. The other sects all looked on with watering mouths, except they didn’t understand the Tang Sect like Nan Shuishui did, and they were just a little hesitant for the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao listened to Nan Qiuqiu as she introduced her sect’s secret grounds. He understood that even though Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu spoke of this as a gift to the Tang Sect, this was equivalent to a gift for him. If there really was a rare ice-type metal inside, then that would be extremely useful for him. He could possibly fix the problem of channeling soul power around his human-shaped soul tool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Human-shaped soul tools didn’t present any problems for the average soul master as long as their rare metals, jewels, and formation arrays were used appropriately. However, he had an Ultimate martial soul, and typical rare metals couldn’t bear his Ultimate Ice once he used it. Even if those rare metals had enough resistance, they didn’t provide any amplification effects. Instead, they could hinder him instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t want to owe too many favors, and this was especially true when he knew of Nan Qiuqiu’s feelings toward him. Therefore, he wanted to take this opportunity to help her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu’s recovery speed was quite fast, and she leapt to her feet energetically after an hour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you ready? You can’t say I’m ambushing you this time,” Huo Yuhao placed his hands behind his back and stared at Nan Qiuqiu in amusement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu couldn’t stand his mocking smile. She said proudly, “Come!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful.” Huo Yuhao warned her as his eyes suddenly became extremely deep and profound. This time, his spiritual power was very gentle as it pressed against Nan Qiuqiu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu sensed that spiritual pressure, and she immediately concentrated to face it. She felt as if this pressure wasn’t that powerful after a few moments, and a proud look immediately appeared on her face. She grunted and said, “I knew it! I was a little panicky in the sky. Otherwise, your spiritual power would have been useless against me, unless you used soul skills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled plainly and said, “Pay attention!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His spiritual pressure gradually began to increase as his voice dropped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was tough in her words, but she knew the gap between Huo Yuhao and herself. Her expression froze as she gathered her strength once more to fend off Huo Yuhao without quarter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual pressure started to increase bit by bit. This level of increase was small, but it was still happening continuously. Every increase gave Nan Qiuqiu a little more pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beads of sweat began to appear on her forehead, and her face turned a little rosy as her mouth opened slightly. A faint odor wafted from her body as she started sweating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was just standing there. He didn’t even use his eyes to look at her as the pressure from his body continued to strengthen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu gradually began to see hallucinations in front of her eyes as her breathing became very labored. She felt as if there were an enormous and formless mountain was weighing down on her soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No... I need to hold on. I can’t let this fellow look down on me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She gritted her teeth before she suddenly shouted to boost her own form as a layer of pinkish light emanated from her body. That was her Ruby Dragon; her martial soul emerged automatically under Huo Yuhao’s formidable spiritual pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pinkish diamond-shaped crystal instantly appeared on Nan Qiuqiu’s forehead as her martial soul appeared. She clearly felt a break in the pressure as the spiritual power inside her spiritual sea fused with her martial soul and resisted Huo Yuhao’s pressure more effectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, she couldn’t even catch a breather as Huo Yuhao’s spiritual pressure suddenly increased. That tremendous pressure made her body tremble as the pinkish light around her shone brilliantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She couldn’t help but feel a chill run down her spine.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Has this guy’s spiritual power really become this powerful?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu was very clear that Huo Yuhao hadn’t yet released his martial soul. This meant that he was pressuring her with pure spiritual power, without any amplification from his Spirit Eyes. However, Nan Qiuqiu had unleashed her martial soul.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter what, I’m still a Soul Emperor! Am I about to crumble against his spiritual pressure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao still wasn’t looking at her as the spiritual pressure increased continuously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pinkish dragon scales emerged over Nan Qiuqiu’s body. Her face and eventually her entire body were covered by dragon scales, but these dragon scales couldn’t defend her against Huo Yuhao’s spiritual pressure. Her body started to quiver and sway, and she grit her teeth as she clenched her fists tightly. However, she was starting to break under the tremendous spiritual pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No, I can hold on!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nan Qiuqiu’s stubbornness acted up. Just as Huo Yuhao thought, provoking this unbending girl was always the simplest and most effective method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time continued to pass as Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power continued to increase. Even he was a little surprised at this moment, as he hadn’t expected her to be able to resist his pressure for so long. An hour had passed, while he had already unleashed forty percent of what he could release.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This forty percent couldn’t be underestimated, as it was equivalent to the spiritual pressure an eight-ringed Soul Douluo could unleash. Ever since Huo Yuhao had completed his fusion with his soul core, his spiritual power’s overall volume could be compared to that of a Transcendent Douluo, while his recovery speed and effectiveness followed in tandem. It was already quite impressive that Nan Qiuqiu could withstand forty percent of his spiritual pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A thread of blood appeared at the corner of Nan Qiuqiu’s mouth. Her eyes and pupils became a little slack, but her unbending will kept her on her feet.</span></p>
