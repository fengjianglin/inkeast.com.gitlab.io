 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya wasn’t far away, and she hurried over when she heard his voice. Even though she still hadn’t fused with the Bluesilver Emperor, her martial soul was recovering, and she had recovered her strength as an eight-ringed soul master in this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The evil soul masters had hurt her badly, but she had managed to keep her strength and improvements. She had recovered her martial soul, and her prowess was increasing linearly. She was now considered one of the stronger ones within the Tang Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hurriedly said, “They’re fine. Don’t worry, eldest senior brother. But the Dou Ling Empire is in trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many people around them, so the four of them went into a silent room as Huo Yuhao recounted the entire journey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei’s expression turned black as he listened to his words. An entire country’s royal palace was flattened just like that! If not for the fact that Xu Sanshi had the Dou Ling Empire’s royal blood in his veins, their problem would be much bigger than this, and the Dou Ling Empire would probably crumble and implode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei heaved a sigh and said, “The continent’s situation is no longer something we can control. We can only do all we can now, and hope for the best. Do you have any suggestions, little junior brother?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao lowered his voice and said, “The academy has too much responsibility because they have to protect themselves. The academy cannot abandon Shrek City’s defenses, even though they’re aware that our enemy will not attack. The Dou Ling Empire and the Star Luo Empire’s elites are also inside Shrek City. If this continues, when the Sun Moon Empire’s great army launches an all-out attack, neither country will be able to stop the Sun Moon Empire no matter who they choose to target. The academy has preserved the two empire’s elites, but we cannot allow the Sun Moon Empire to destroy the Dou Ling Empire and the Star Luo Empire just like that. Therefore, our top priority is to draw the Sun Moon Empire’s army away from Shrek City. At least, their target will become a lot more evident after retreating. When that happens, we will have it easier, whether we are trying to hold them back or fighting against them. At the very least, we will not be dragged by our noses.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Sun Moon Empire’s army is like a bone stuck in our throats. Shrek City’s position has tied up the Star Luo and Dou Ling empire, and they’re not having a good time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei said, “But what can we do so that the Sun Moon Empire will retreat? That’s almost impossible. They got away with destroying the Dou Ling Empire’s royal palace this time, and that manner can even be replicated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have an idea,” Huo Yuhao suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Tang Wutong was astonished when she heard his words, not to mention Bei Bei or Tang Ya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have an idea? What’s your idea?” Bei Bei said in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao clenched his fists subconsciously. “The only way to deal with the Sun Moon Empire’s overt scheme is to surprise them! And I am the surprise factor. I’m going for a rest, eldest senior brother, Teacher Xiao Ya.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao turned to leave as he finished his statement without even explaining things properly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei frowned, but he didn’t chase after Huo Yuhao and allowed him to leave. Tang Wutong hurriedly followed behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya nudged Bei Bei and asked, “Why aren’t you asking him what he intends to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bei Bei shook his head and replied, “I trust him, so I’m not going to ask. Yuhao has grown much more than we have over the past few years, and his personality has become increasingly stable and mature. If somebody else were to go through this matter, that person would probably have panicked a long time ago, and wouldn’t know what to do at all. But he’s not panicking, can’t you see? His eyes are determined, and it’s clear that he’s had a plan all along. Since that’s the case, why should I ask? All we must do is deal with our own matters adequately. Our operation can continue once the Sun Moon Empire retreats.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Ya nodded and said, “Alright, let’s go do some work.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao returned to his room, and Tang Wutong followed him inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s your solution?” Bei Bei didn’t ask, but that didn’t mean that Tang Wutong wouldn’t. She also trusted Huo Yuhao, but she was much more worried about him at the same time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t tell Bei Bei about how he had tried to resign at the Sea God’s Pavilion before this. Even though he wasn’t successful, Tang Wutong could tell from his mannerisms what he was about to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao exhaled deeply, and he contemplated for a few moments before he pulled Tang Wutong over and whispered something into her ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? You… but will they agree?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled plainly and said, “I will make them agree. This plan has more than one goal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was worried. “But you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao smiled. “What? Do you not trust my strength?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll go with you!” Tang Wutong retorted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao shook his head. “No, my plan cannot be completed like that. Furthermore, we can’t fuse our martial souls because martial soul fusion skills consume too much energy, and are not suitable for prolonged battles. Don’t worry, you can sit back and watch my enemies, and you can watch your husband massacre everyone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I haven’t married you yet!” Tang Wutong snapped unhappily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, my dear. When is my father-in-law coming back? I can’t wait any longer. Come, let me give you a kiss. My skin is quite thick anyway.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sun was already high in the sky as it shone over the great earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A new day had begun, and the Sun Moon Empire’s deadline for Shrek City was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, strangely, the Sun Moon Empire wasn’t doing anything at all. They weren’t even pushing forward. They just stayed forty-five kilometers from Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This distance wasn’t considered close, but it wasn’t considered very far either. Soul engineers would only need about fifteen minutes of flying at full speed before they could launch an onslaught against Shrek City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City had been wary and vigilant over the past few days. Now time was up, and nobody knew whether the Sun Moon Empire would make their move. Every soul engineer in the city was nervously prepared for battle with their soul tools, and there were quite a few stronger soul masters patrolling outside the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek City’s surveillance soul tools were inferior to the Sun Moon Empire’s, but Shrek City had a lot more soul masters than they did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simply put, if the Sun Moon Empire didn’t have their formidable soul tool fronts and linked soul tools, Shrek City might not lose if they fought head-on!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere between both parties was a little tense, and an epic battle could occur at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The quieter the Sun Moon Empire was, the stronger the feeling of pressure before a rainstorm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right in this moment, a single person appeared soundlessly on Shrek City’s battlements. No, he wasn’t the only one. Someone else stepped out after that person appeared, her long, pinkish-blue hair draped behind her back as she stood next to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao gazed into the distance. Even though the Sun Moon Empire was forty-five kilometers away, the weather was good, and he could still roughly see what was going on with his vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sun Moon Empire’s great army was still over there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong stood beside him quietly, and she pulled over her long hair from behind her back and began to comb it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Combing hair on Shrek City’s battlements wasn’t something that just anyone would do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commanders on top of Shrek’s city walls responsible for patrolling stood near him as they looked on silently with respectful expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew what Huo Yuhao looked like. Ever since that day when he had bravely challenged the Beast God, Shrek City’s soul masters and the two empires’ soul masters could all recognize him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao did lose that day, but he managed to survive after the Beast God had attacked him at full strength. That proved how powerful he was. The Beast God, Di Tian was the strongest individual on the continent, stronger than even an Ultimate Douluo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Huo Yuhao didn’t waste any words at all as he stood on the battlements. Furthermore, the main defensive force which was on the city walls was the Heavy Artillery Soul Engineer Legion, and Huo Yuhao was their commander anyway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He just stood there in silence and continued to watch. Tang Wutong finished styling her hair as braids fell down to her hips, and extended to the top of her head. Her hair was tied into a scorpion braid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should still stay here,” Huo Yuhao glanced at his lover exasperatedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong shook her head. “I don’t have to participate, but I have to be beside you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao caressed her head as he came up next to her cheek and kissed her gently. “You smell good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong was embarrassed. “Everyone is looking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let them look, I’m kissing my wife. Let’s go, we don’t have much time.” Huo Yuhao held Tang Wutong’s hand as he spoke, and they soared into the sky as everyone looked on. Nobody saw them use flying-type soul tools as they flew toward the Sun Moon Empire just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’ve… they’ve flown away?” Shrek’s city defense army looked on with widened eyes and slack jaws.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What’s happening? They’re flying away just like that? Why… why are they flying toward the Sun Moon Empire? What are they trying to do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Quick, report to the academy. Tell them that Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong have gone toward the Sun Moon Empire camp.” They thought about the Sun Moon Empire’s demand for Shrek City to hand Huo Yuhao over, and the city defense army’s general began to sweat. Who knew what they were doing? Were they handing themselves over?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faint light flickered as a dash of ice-cold light flashed across Huo Yuhao’s face. He flew through the air as his spiritual power surged forth like a tidal wave. However, his spiritual power went up into the sky instead of toward the Sun Moon Empire’s camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s terrifying Spiritual Detection covered a vast area as aerial surveillance soul tools appeared one after another within his senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shrek Academy had many powerful individuals, and that was the reason why the Sun Moon Empire didn’t dare to allow their aerial surveillance soul tools to fly too close to Shrek City to avoid any losses. But these aerials surveillance soul tools had nowhere to hide in front of Huo Yuhao’s formidable spiritual power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But they had already discovered his presence at this point, and they immediately retreated towards the Sun Moon Empire’s camp like a wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t hide themselves. Huo Yuhao had an “excellent” reputation in the Sun Moon Empire. Besides his prowess, Huo Yuhao had destroyed the greatest number of the Sun Moon Empire’s aerial surveillance soul tools. Therefore, once the soul engineers who were controlling the aerial surveillance soul tools discovered him and immediately reported to their superiors, they hurriedly withdrew their surveillance soul tools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao withdrew his consciousness in the next moment. He wanted this outcome. The Sun Moon Empire had given them pressure all this time, but this time, it was his turn to give them some pressure. This was the only way that his plan could continue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They quickly covered the remaining distance to the camp, and it didn’t take long before the Sun Moon Empire’s camp appeared clearly in Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong’s vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao squinted slightly, his expression as cold and solemn as ever. Huo Yuhao was as calm as he could be under such circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dense energy waves appeared from the Sun Moon Empire. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong could evidently feel the concentrating energy from the ground even though they were in the sky, as soul tool fronts began operating one after another as they locked onto Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single person could do nothing against these soul tool fronts no matter how formidable that person was. The Sun Moon Empire had already proved that fact with the Beast God. Even though the Beast God had also destroyed a soul tool front, the Sun Moon Empire had managed to force him away to the point where evil soul masters took that opportunity to hurt him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was strong, but he was still just a single person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the soul engineers who were locking onto Huo Yuhao didn’t have that thought for a long time before something happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao vanished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong vanished at almost the same time in midair. They didn’t leave any traces at all, so all the waves that were locking onto them immediately became useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was strong enough to conceal himself even before he became a Titled Douluo, not to mention now. Shaking off those surveillance soul tools was simply too easy. The difference between Huo Yuhao and Di Tian was that Di Tian could manipulate spatial power, but Huo Yuhao relied on his martial soul’s strength to integrate himself into his surroundings. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao could imitate any kind of energy wave with his formidable spiritual senses. Even a few Ultimate Douluo probably wouldn’t be entirely certain of finding him under such circumstances, let alone these surveillance soul tools. At least, these soul tools couldn’t do that with their current technological standard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong vanished, but the Sun Moon Empire’s camp didn’t loosen up because of that. The soul engineers were very clear, no matter what Class they were, about what would happen to them if a Transcendent Douluo managed to infiltrate their soul tool front, or if one came close to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s clash with Di Tian gave them a deep impression and lesson. There were still traces of the frightening fusion of darkness and ice on the ground, and those traces weren’t something that could be dispelled within a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sigh could be heard from the sky before Huo Yuhao’s voice traveled far into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Didn’t you guys want Shrek City to hand me over? I’m here now. Who’s coming to receive me?”</span></p>
