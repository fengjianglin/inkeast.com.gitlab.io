 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

He was really shocked. When he had seen the Goddess of Light for the first time, he had felt that it was love at first sight. However, a change had occurred at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t want to hurt Ling Luochen and Ning Tian, but Elder Mu had told him before that a man must be decisive in terms of his relationships. Otherwise, he would only cause more pain. Rejection was a better choice for the other party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why Huo Yuhao had rejected both Ling Luochen and Ning Tian after confirming the identity of the number two lady, so as to make them give up completely. It wasn’t just a form of respect to them; it also helped to prevent further misunderstandings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If people weren’t steadier in terms of relationships, they might be stuck in them forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Huo Yuhao heard the story of the Twin Holy Dragons of Black and White and Ye Xishui from Elder Xuan on the way back, he understood this point even more. That was why he didn’t hesitate to make his choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, trouble still arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that he had hurt Ling Luochen, even though she looked very calm. What else could he say? Since she wanted to challenge him, his only choice was to accept her challenge. If he lost, he might as well be a bachelor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan turned to Ning Tian and said, “Ning Tian, you’re an auxiliary-type soul master, even though you’re on a different level. You’re challenging him with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ning Tian took in a deep breath and looked into the sky. She suppressed her tears. When she looked at Huo Yuhao again, there was only a sharp, intense light coming from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to challenge the both of them. I’m an auxiliary-type soul master, thus I hope to find a partner to carry out a two-versus-two fight. My partner has to be of a five-ringed cultivation, too. That’s why I hope to find two five-ringed soul masters to make it three of us. Since one of them has five rings and the other has six rings, I guess it’s fair.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan nodded and asked, “Who are your partners then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ning Tian said without any hesitation, “Wu Feng, Xie Huanyue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s gaze shifted slightly. Wu Feng was waiting for him here, meaning that she wouldn’t choose Dai Huabin easily!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Ming said loudly, “I’ll find Xie Huanyue. He should be by the shore.” As she spoke, her figure flashed, and she stepped onto the water’s surface before proceeding to the shore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A man beside Huo Yuhao couldn’t help but comment, “My friend, is that a self-ridiculing soul skill you have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan also looked at Huo Yuhao. “Yuhao, are you fine with this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded again, “I am.” He could tell that Ning Tian was being sincere when she chose him, whereas Dai Huabin and Wu Feng were probably just finding trouble with him. He was also secretly enraged. If they wanted to come for him, then so be it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the challenge involved the number two female student, Zhang Lexuan turned to ask her, “Number two female student, do you accept this challenge?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She finally opened her mouth and replied, “I don’t agree.” When her voice sounded for the first time, it was very captivating and pleasant. She was like an oriole that cleared everyone’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing her voice, Huo Yuhao felt a strong sense of familiarity. He was certain that he had heard this voice before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That day, he had unintentionally taken Wang Qiu’er’s veil. She had spoken to him then, saying “Give it back.” Her voice had been captivating, like singing birds, leaving a deep impression in his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao remembered it clearly, because he had watched her closely. Wang Qiu’er’s voice sounded a little lower than this young lady’s voice, which was smoother. Had he recognized the wrong person? However, he clearly remembered the Radiant Butterfly Goddess’ wings and the pinkish-blue hair!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I must have recalled wrongly!,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao told himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is your reason for not accepting?” Zhang Lexuan continued asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, this mysterious female student was under everyone’s scrutiny. Rejecting the challenge? That could disqualify her, unless she could give a logical reason. Was she going to give up? After all, she hadn’t spoken since the start, and no one knew her character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her voice was as pleasant as ever. “I don’t think we have to go through all that trouble. I can team up with Huo Yuhao, and we can fight the five of them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she said this, the entire place went silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was being too impulsive. Furthermore, she was too arrogant and self-confident!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though four of them had five rings and only Ling Luochen had six rings, all five of them were from the inner courtyard! They hadn’t made their way to this point by relying on medicine, either!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the five of them, Ning Tian’s Seven Treasures Glazed Pagoda was undoubtedly the strongest. However, the rest of their martial souls were definitely not weak. Dai Huabin’s White Tiger, Wu Feng’s Red Dragon, Xie Huanyue’s Rubberdon, and Ling Luochen’s ice element, all of them were considered top-ranked martial souls in the outside world. Although they were some way off from the best, they certainly possessed the foundations to become Titled Douluos!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two against five – this Wang Qiu’er was too arrogant! Zhang Lexuan also thought that she was being too proud. Furthermore, her words weren’t very good for uniting the students. Seeing that Wu Feng and Xie Huanyue weren’t here at the moment, Ning Tian and Dai Huabin’s expressions changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ning Tian turned pale, while Dai Huabin was angry. There was a fierce look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Number two female student, this doesn’t seem too appropriate. You must bear in mind that we have to unite the students,” Zhang Lexuan advised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The number two female student was silent for awhile before she said slowly, “Eldest senior sister, today’s my important day. I’ve been waiting for this day for too long. There are many seniors around. I’d like to ask them how they feel when there are stumbling blocks in their way just as they are about to get together with their loved one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does this unite them? Furthermore, I’m confident of winning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She started to talk more and more. Huo Yuhao felt a greater sense of familiarity as he listened to her, especially when she talked about her loved one. Huo Yuhao was flabbergasted.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;She likes me? However, when did we interact if she’s Wang Dong’s sister? We’ve never interacted before!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t believe that a ravishing beauty had fallen in love with him at first sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words resonated with many of the people present. Indeed, her words were very strong. However, there were five of them trying to “kidnap the bride”, and they had formed a team!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sister, I support you. All the best!” Wu Ming shouted suddenly, almost scaring Chu Qingtian into the water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, senior!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Lexuan didn’t know how to respond to her words. Yes! They had made a mutual choice, but they had encountered so many people trying to kidnap the bride. It was possible to understand Ling Luochen and Ning Tian. After all, they had chosen Huo Yuhao, too! However, Dai Huabin was obviously causing trouble. He hadn’t even seen the number two female student before. Why was he trying to kidnap the bride? Nobody present was familiar with the number two female student.</span></p>

When Bei Bei told her that she was a new student, Zhang Lexuan trusted him and didn’t probe further.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao is just like you. As a member of the Sea God’s Pavilion, do you think he was only capable of winning over the elders just because he was Elder Mu’s disciple? Among the Shrek’s Seven Monsters, his cultivation is the lowest. However, he has the strongest abilities.”</span></p>

They immediately gathered beside Ning Tian, along with Dai Huabin.</span></p>

As she took a step outward, drifted forward, and landed on Huo Yuhao’s water lily. She reached out to grab Huo Yuhao’s hand.</span></p>

There was a shocked look in his eyes.</span></p>

As the main force in the Ultimate Soldier Plan and one of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, he had been through a lot. Naturally, he wouldn’t lose his cool easily. It showed how intensely shocked he was right now.</span></p>

Everything around him seemed to disappear. Only the number two female student remained.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao’s soul power was like a bee seeing a fresh flower. It instantly combined with her soul power and turned into an enormous river surging through his body. It quickly completed a circulation before flowing into the number two female student’s body. At this moment, a layer of dim golden light appeared on each of them.</span></p>
