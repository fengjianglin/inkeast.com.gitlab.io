 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was still staying close to the protective barrier behind the fortress, so she was immediately repelled by an immense force. A look of astonishment flashed across her pretty face as she extended her wings to compensate for the enormous pushing power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao frowned below the stage as he muttered to himself, “A shock bomb! Is he not afraid of the force shattering his own heart?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shock bombs were a special type of soul tool. Shock bombs were meant for offensive use, and they could produce powerful shockwaves to strike at opponents within a certain range. What Zhou Xinghao did was use a shock bomb to attack both himself and Wang Dong’er at the same time impartially, so that he could push Wang Dong’er away from him. He intended to hurt Wang Dong’er more, but he also hurt himself in the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, his Invincible Barrier hasn’t completely vanished yet.” Huo Yuhao immediately recovered after his momentary surprise. Zhou Xinghao used his own Invincible Barrier to withstand the shock bomb’s effects, and even though he had to consume soul power in the process, this was better than the shock bomb taking effect on his own body. Furthermore, he finally took the opportunity to spin around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The several hundred cannon barrels on and around him flared blindingly the moment Wang Dong’er appeared in his field of view. At this point, he was no longer just a porcupine, he had turned into a terrifying metal blender!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All kinds of soul rays and soul cannon shells: explosive shells, incendiary shells, paralysis rays, freezing rays, shock bombs, decomposition shells, rupturing bombs, and various other frightening attacks covered an area of twenty meters around Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This metal hurricane that erupted so suddenly seemed to symbolize Zhou Xinghao’s emotions. His expression looked savage and ferocious, and his eyes were bloodshot with rage and fury. His eyes were as wide as they could be, and he wanted to watch his metal hurricane tear Wang Dong’er’s body to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were so close together, and defense wasn’t Wang Dong’er’s forte, either. This was everything that he had, and it would be extremely difficult for her to escape if she found herself locked in by this all-out assault.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Hongchen covered her mouth beneath the competition stage. Several people from the Tang Sect camp stood up with nervous looks on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had just used his Necromancer’s Silent Heart, so his face was still as cold as before. His brain was still calculating at top speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right in the moment that her opponent erupted, Wang Dong’er still felt goosebumps all over her body even though she was prepared. He lived up to the Sun Moon Imperial Soul Engineering Academy’s name after all, and their soul tools were very formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right when that metal hurricane was about to rip her to pieces, she vanished into thin air…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, she disappeared without any warning at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clang!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A powerful force appeared behind his back, and a sharp aura of light forced its way into the soul fort and poured inside. The entire cannon base began to shake with this attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can it be!? How can this be Instant Shift?” At this moment, Zhou Xinghao was facing his team’s waiting area, staring at Xiao Hongchen with a doubtful look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They didn’t have to talk about Wang Dong’er’s fifth soul skill, the one that she used to defeat Shi Xing. The Instant Shift that she had just used was clearly not something that she released with her soul rings. How could she possess a skill like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Hongchen’s eyes froze as well. Who would have thought that Wang Dong’er had a trump card like that in a time as crucial as this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er’s dazzling bluish-golden wings slashed ferociously at his soul tool fortress. Zhou Xinghao no longer had his Invincible Barrier, and no matter how tough the fort’s metal was, it couldn’t be compared to a Soul Emperor’s attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two deep gashes appeared behind the soul tool fort. Zhou Xinghao spun around hysterically, but Wang Dong’er kept herself close to him and used the Ghost Shadow Perplexing Track as she followed his rotation. Her wings resembled two heavy blades as they lashed out again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Metal fragments broke apart and flowed out continuously, and soul tool after mighty soul tool was rapidly being damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Xinghao wanted to use his remaining Invincible Barrier along with another shock bomb to find yet another opportunity. However, Wang Dong’er’s use of her Instant Shift made sure that he couldn’t even muster any self-confidence at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What difference will it make if I pull the same trick again? She can just use Instant Shift to evade everything...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Xinghao understood that the key to his defeat was allowing Wang Dong’er to come near him. Her Instant Shift also had a range limit, and his soul tool fortress wasn’t suited for an opponent like her at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Enough!” At this moment, a loud shout tore through the air, and a layer of silver light pushed Wang Dong’er away. The judge stood in front of Zhou Xinghao like a hen that was trying to protect her chicks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you doing?” Wang Dong’er exclaimed angrily with a cold look in her eyes. She was already preparing for a killing blow. The soul tool fortress was already cracked and breaking apart, and Zhou Xinghao was about to perish at her hands at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The judge lowered his voice and said, “He doesn’t have the ability to fight back anymore. I’m the judge, and I rule that the Tang Sect is victorious in this round. I have the authority to stop the competition if one party is no longer able to fight back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er gradually calmed down. She grunted dispassionately as she gripped her Milk Bottle and walked back to the center of the arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I haven’t lost yet! Go to hell!” Zhou Xinghou roared hysterically, and he arched his body backwards and revealed eight shining silver cannon mouths on his chest. Eight silver rays immediately fired off toward Wang Dong’er with lightning speed in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er had her back to him, and she had not expected that Zhou Xinghao would launch another attack against her when the judge had already ruled this round as her win. Furthermore, the judge did nothing to stop him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was that this wasn’t because the judge was biased towards Zhou Xinghao; he also didn’t expect Zhou Xinghou to continue attacking after his ruling. However, he did feel an intense excitement and delight when those eight silver rays flew toward Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch out!” Huo Yuhao’s icy voice suddenly rang out in Wang Dong’er’s mind. Wang Dong’er always trusted Huo Yuhao’s words. Furthermore, she could also hear Zhou Xinghao’s hysterical voice behind her. She lunged forward towards the ground, and her fifth soul ring lit up once more as intense golden light immediately covered her entire body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pop, pop, pop</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…Even though Wang Dong’er’s evasion was quick, the soul rays were travelling at breakneck speed, and three rays still hit her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’er grunted from the pain as she stumbled a few steps forward from the force. Even though she had the Goddess of Light’s Possession, three holes still appeared on her back, and she felt as if there was some terrifying force that was rapidly causing her body to break apart. If she hadn’t used her Goddess of Light’s Possession in time to defend herself, the rays would have tunneled right through her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard!” Several people from the Tang Sect leapt onto the competition stage in an instant. However, their movements couldn’t compare to how quick another beam of light was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That light had a radiant golden color, and was tinged with deep purple hues. This beam seemed material, as if it could pierce through even time and space. The competition stage’s protective dome had receded the moment the judge declared that Wang Dong’er was victorious in this round, so there was nothing blocking this beam. Right when Wang Dong’er was lunging forward to lie flat on the ground, the purplish-golden light that seemed to tunnel through reality and eternity arrived before Zhou Xinghao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Xinghao howled and released his Invincible Barrier once more. He was excited at this moment; the silver rays that he had just used were forceful decomposition rays, and they possessed a special characteristic of breaking apart all kinds of matter. These rays were considered one of the most destructive soul rays. He could imagine Wang Dong’er’s body breaking apart, and drawing her last breath from the decomposition.</span></p>

He deeply believed that whatever his opponent unleashed couldn’t do anything to him with his Invincible Barrier around him, no matter what it was.</span></p>

A golden light projection that resembled a skeleton immediately flickered above Zhou Xinghao’s body, and his entire body seemed to freeze and go slack.</span></p>

Flesh and blood flew in all directions in that moment, and his damaged protective soul barrier was also blown into smithereens. Zhou Xinghao transformed into a tornado of flesh and metal that whirled all over the place.</span></p>

Jing Hongchen’s face was black as he stood up on the rostrum, and the petrifying atmosphere that resulted from the explosion that had occurred on stage caused even the Sun Moon Empire’s team to pause as they dashed onto the stage. Even Xiao Hongchen’s footsteps halted momentarily.</span></p>

This attack was launched from one hundred meters away, and Zhou Xinghao also had his Invincible Barrier to protect him! Despite all that, this strike broke through his Invincible Barrier!
