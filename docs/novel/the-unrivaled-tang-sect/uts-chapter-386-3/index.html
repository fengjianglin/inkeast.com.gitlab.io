Their soul powers were instantly, completely connected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their Eyes of Destiny shone brightly on their foreheads, and they also released golden lights from their bodies at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their auras experienced transformations at this moment. The golden dragon that initially revolved around Wang Qiu’er now suddenly revolved around both of them. The azure lights that came from Huo Yuhao’s body were also released with their bodies as the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was a martial soul fusion. When they held hands, they completed their martial fusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had never thought of giving the fusion between him and Wang Qiu’er a name. However, he was willing to call it the Haoqiu Power now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know why Wang Qiu’er had appeared at this moment. However, Wang Qiu’er’s arrival gave him hope in this life-and-death moment. After months of closed-door cultivation, he also became clearer over many things. The debt he owed Wang Qiu’er became much deeper right now. He had only once ever asked himself whether Wang Qiu’er really didn’t belong in his heart. The answer was negative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he learned that Wang Qiu’er plucked another vine of Yearning Heartbroken Grass to save him at the Icefire Yin-Yang Well, a slit opened in his heart for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When that golden dragon rose into the sky, its roars reverberated, and Wang Qiu’er’s powdery-blue wavy hair appeared in front of him. Apart from feeling guilty, he was also excited. The fighting intent in his heart was instantly ignited and started to burn unprecedentedly strongly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter what, he had to charge out. It was for himself, for Wang Dong’er and for Wang Qiu’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Huo Yuhao was burning with passion and feelings, Wang Qiu’er felt very cool. There was a cool aura coming from Huo Yuhao’s palm. This cool was extremely comfortable, especially when her hand was being held by his strong yet stable hand. She only felt that her heart had collided with something. The resilience that she had mustered up before coming seemed to be crushed once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nemesis! He’s my nemesis!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er pursed her lips tightly. However, she also blushed slightly, which made her look even more captivating. If she was with him, so what if she was against thousands of enemies?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the two of them knew their own psychological changes. Even though they hadn’t faced many enemies together in the past, they seemed to already have great telepathy with each other, and it wasn’t inferior to that between Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their Instant Teleportation Left Leg Bones brought them close to each other. When their martial souls fused, they both surpassed their original cultivations and reached another realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Huo Yuhao was holding onto Wang Qiu’er with his right hand. His left hand was empty. When he pulled Wang Qiu’er, he lifted his left hand, and the little Snow Lady silently separated from his back. A white glow started to ripple behind Huo Yuhao’s back, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another miraculous scene was also playing out behind Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er. After they unleashed their Destiny Gaze earlier, a projection of a vertical eye had appeared behind each of their backs. These vertical eyes now also turned orange-gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Elder’s Thunder God’s Binding lost its effect in the sky, and he had no choice but to stop, as he was shocked. Nan Shuishui and Nan Qiuqiu were still stuck within his binding, and he had to deal with them first. He lifted his right hand and pulled them to his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Wu Yu was impatient, and she unleashed her pitch-black Spirit of Vengeance immediately. She screamed and charged towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A streak of deep blue light swept past the sky, carrying a sinister chill and the Snow Empress’ pride. It didn’t even bother with the Fourth Elder’s Netherworld Sword and went directly for his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Netherworld Sword only swept past Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er. They didn’t even intend to dodge this attack. Did the Fourth Elder make a mistake?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Huo Yuhao’s Empresses’ Sword, the Snowless Glacier, landed directly on the black fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black fog where the Fourth Elder was, instantly took form and converted into the sword tip of his Netherworld Sword before it shot upward, blocking Huo Yuhao’s Snowless Glacier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, something weird occurred. As the two swords were about to clash, Huo Yuhao’s Empress’ Sword seemed to be guided by an unknown force. Even the Fourth Elder’s lock-on abilities lost their effect at this moment, and Huo Yuhao’s Empress’ Sword brushed past his Netherworld Sword before slashing at his black fog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” The Fourth Elder groaned. As he retracted his black fog, he re-appeared in mid-air and turned into an ice sculpture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this ice encasement was crushed in the next moment, the Fourth Elder was still struck by Huo Yuhao’s Empress’ Sword, and he staggered back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire process happened very quickly, but it was still unbelievable. How was the Fourth Elder so easily hit in this direct clash against his opponent, even though he was a Titled Douluo? In addition, Huo Yuhao’s abilities were miles below him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao revealed a slight smile on his face. He turned and lifted his head. His Eye of Destiny was flashing purplish-gold right now. &nbsp;It was his Spiritual Shock!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yu suddenly stopped in mid-air. Following this, she screamed pathetically and was even flung backward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While she was supposed to have great immunity against Huo Yuhao’s abilities given that she was also a spiritual-type soul master, she was completely suppressed, as her spiritual cultivation was inferior to Huo Yuhao’s spiritual cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s pure spiritual cultivation was already superior to hers. In addition, his soul power had fused with Wang Qiu’er’s soul power, and thus his overall soul power had increased. In terms of cultivation, this combination of Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er wasn’t any weaker than Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Huo Yuhao attacked, Wang Qiu’er didn’t stay idle. When Huo Yuhao unleashed his Empress’ Palm, she was clearly aware of what he was trying to do. She raised her Golden Dragon Spear, and golden light emanated from her body. These golden lights, which seemed to shine in thick layers, instantly gathered toward her right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s Empress’ Palm slashed the ice sculpture. In the next instant, Wang Qiu’er’s spear turned into a streak of golden light that shot straight towards the Fourth Elder’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er was extremely adept in direct confrontations. Her terrifying strength made her publicly recognized as the top dragon warrior in the Continental Elite Youth Soul Master Tournament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, she wasn’t just unleashing her own strength. She also had Huo Yuhao’s soul power to supplement her. Considering that their soul powers were completely compatible, the fusion of their soul powers didn’t just spark a linear increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That streak of golden light carried both Wang Qiu’er’s strength and Huo Yuhao’s spiritual intent, and it reached the Fourth Elder instantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Elder groaned, and a dark-green light shone from his Netherworld Sword. A tragic scream sounded, and a human-shaped figure could dimly be seen getting crushed. The light that came from the Fourth Elder’s Netherworld Sword turned weird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark-green sword light was refracted and caused everything to look as if it came from two different worlds. Another purplish Netherworld Sword silently appeared and maintained a parallel position to the dark-green Netherworld Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s Golden Dragon Spear rapidly shot forward and stabbed just in between the Fourth Elder’s two Netherworld Swords. However, they combined together at this moment, and a strong layer of silver light was released from between these two swords.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a clang of metal, and Wang Qiu’er’s spear shook tremendously. It had already stabbed halfway between the two swords, but it didn’t manage to stab completely past them. It thus failed to reach the Fourth Elder’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Qiu’er’s expression changed slightly. In the next instant, her spear had already turned into a streak of flowing light and sprang into the air.</span></p>

In that case, I’ll use your souls to replace it!” His dark-green Netherworld Sword shot forward, while his purplish sword disappeared. However, his second and third soul rings lit up at the same time.</span></p>

It changed into countless sharp swords that shot towards Huo Yuhao and Wang Qiu’er. Suddenly, the entire sky turned green, and space itself seemed as if it were about to be destroyed.</span></p>

Even though the Fourth Elder’s cultivation couldn’t compare to Elder Xuan, he was still a Titled Douluo, and his fighting strength was still extremely terrifying.</span></p>

Wang Qiu’er had managed to advance from six rings to seven rings in just a few months. Apart from the soul power increase she got from the Yin-Yang Love Querying Valley, her own cultivation had also improved significantly through the tournament earlier.</span></p>
