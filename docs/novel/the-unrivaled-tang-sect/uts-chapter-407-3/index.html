 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

He reached out with his left hand and opened his palm to block Huo Yuhao’s fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t do so because his body wasn’t strong enough to take this punch. Rather, he did so out of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not a single sound was produced in this clash. Di Tian’s smooth white palm grabbed Huo Yuhao’s fist, which was glistening golden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Di Tian’s expression changed drastically in the next moment, and he swiftly released the young man’s palm, as if he had grabbed hot charcoal. Huo Yuhao’s Fist of Remembrance reached in deep just like that and slammed against Di Tian’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Golden light gathered, and there seemed to be a giant and formless hand with an iron grip on Di Tian’s body, such that he had no choice but to take a hit from this fist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Beast God’s body quivered as dark golden light flickered once on his body. The space around him that had collapsed was instantly shattered, and he transformed into a dark golden ray and withdrew far into the distance. Huo Yuhao’s punch didn’t hit anything in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If a human or a soul beast had been watching this fight, they would probably have been so astonished that their eyeballs would have popped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was Di Tian? He was the strongest Savage Beast in the entire Continent. He was the Beast God of the Great Star Dou Forest! Yet he was forced by a Soul Sage to the point where he had no choice but to evade his attack. If this was spread to the outside world, Huo Yuhao would become an instant celebrity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian waved his left hand and frightening soul power undulations appeared in midair. An enormous pitch-black dragon claw appeared out of nowhere and grasped Huo Yuhao, sealing all the soul power that he wanted to activate in the next moment. Di Tian forcibly pulled him out from his longing emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao woke up completely as he sensed all that tremendous squeezing pressure around him. He gazed at Di Tian, and couldn’t help but feel a little dazed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian himself seemed a little dazed at this moment. His expression was a little pale, but his eyes flowed with a dash of tenderness. However, his expression swiftly returned to normal, and he didn’t seem very friendly when he looked at Huo Yuhao once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your spiritual power is stronger than I had imagined. This strength isn’t something the Auspicious Beast has bestowed upon you! Concrete-material spiritual power!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was also a little dazed. He didn’t really understand why Di Tian was so afraid to interact with his Fist of Remembrance.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Di Tian’s strength, not even the Haodong Palm can hurt him even a little bit, let alone the Fist of Remembrance! But why is his expression so strange?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian said plainly, “You can train by yourself. However, you’ll have to make the necessary preparations for what you have to do two days from now.” With that, Di Tian vanished into thin air beside the lake, just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t move an inch as he watched Di Tian disappear, and he began to contemplate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What can it be that makes even the Beast God afraid? It can’t be the strength of my Fist of Remembrance. Even if my spiritual power were twice as strong, I couldn’t possibly hurt him. Since he’s not afraid of my attacking strength, then…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emotions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, he’s afraid of the longing feelings within my Fist of Remembrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">My soul power is like an ant compared to the Beast God. However, the gap between our spiritual powers isn’t that great. When I’m longing for Dong’er, my spiritual power is raised to its highest possible level, to the point where I am unable to control it properly. This longing feeling is completely presented in my Fist of Remembrance, and it must be that emotion that affected the Beast God. It must be that emotion that triggered his memories, and everything that he misses so much, so that he evaded my fist in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was very intelligent. He understood the process after contemplating for just a short period of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who says soul beasts don’t have feelings? Seems like the Beast God has feelings and emotions deep in his heart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s thoughts stopped here, and a faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. His thoughts were full of wonderful goodness, as he thought about the joy of being together with Dong’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greatest reason why his Fist of Remembrance was so powerful was because he would be immersed in his emotions. Back then, he had used this strength to defeat two evil Soul Douluo, and this was the very reason why he could accomplish that feat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as Xu Sanshi had said to him, he couldn’t rely on his Three Ultimate Haodong Skills in the future. Otherwise, once Wang Dong’er woke up and returned to his embrace, his cultivation would be greatly weakened. At the very least, his fighting strength would be greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Tian was gone, but Huo Yuhao didn’t stop cultivating. He rarely had the opportunity to be in such a quiet place that was so rich with life energy at the same time, in addition to the Goldenjade Fruit’s nutrition. He seemed to have returned to the days when he had just entered Shrek Academy with Wang Dong’er, when he didn’t sleep or rest so that he could meditate more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao discovered as he meditated that no matter what he did, Dong’er’s figure kept surfacing in his mind. He was in a bit of a daze.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes! Ever since I left the Duke’s mansion, I’ve been together with Dong’er, and even though we’ve been separated from time to time, we were still thinking about each other and longing for each other. Don’t worry, Dong’er, I’ll definitely look for you when I settle some things!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He became more immersed in his meditation as thoughts spun through his mind. He felt and sensed the fusion between his soul power and his spiritual power, and every soul skill that he had absorbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Typical soul masters never had enough soul skills to use. They had to decide whether they needed control-type or assault-type soul skills when choosing soul rings, whether they needed soul skills for single targets or an area of effect. Questions like those always bugged them, but Huo Yuhao was in the opposite situation; he just had too many soul skills!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was born with twin martial souls, and this meant he innately had twice as many soul skills as normal soul masters did. Furthermore, he had two hundred-thousand-year soul rings among his many soul rings, and he had another rose-gold soul ring that belonged to Qiu’er, which was equivalent to a hundred-thousand-year soul ring. He had another one million-year soul ring that gave him four soul skills, and he had several soul bones, as well!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t afraid of not having enough soul skills. Instead, there were too many of too many different kinds, and he always had certain problems choosing which soul skills to use. This was also what Huo Yuhao had to iron out at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Three Ultimate Haodong Skills’ side effects were too great, so he had to use them as seldom as he could afford to in the future. Under such a situation, choosing soul skills and how he was going to fight became Huo Yuhao’s most important matter at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t want to add any soul rings to his second martial soul, the Ice Jade Empress Scorpion, at least for the moment, because there was no need for him to increase his number of soul rings. Obtaining more soul rings would boost his physique, but he didn’t have to worry about that after assimilating the Golden Dragon’s strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He would rather work hard to improve his Spirit Eyes, and only when he became a Titled Douluo would he try his best to add higher-level soul rings to his Ice Jade Empress Scorpion. From his perspective, not even ten-thousand-year soul rings meant much to him; only hundred-thousand-year soul rings could satisfy his needs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao had no idea how many ranks above 70 his soul power was at the moment. After he absorbed his seventh soul ring, because that soul ring belonged to a hundred-thousand-year Evileye Tyrant, his soul power rose by quite a bit. He estimated his soul power to be at about Rank 72, more or less. He wasn’t even twenty years old, and yet his soul power was extraordinary. This also meant that if the Continental Advanced Soul Master Academy Soul Dueling Tournament was happening right now, he would still be qualified to participate in the tournament. He was a Soul Sage with an Ultimate martial soul! He also had twin martial souls! He could probably easily sweep most teams by himself, or perhaps every single team!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">------</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days passed as he meditated. Even though time was very fleeting for soul masters and their cultivation, these two days had been very beneficial for Huo Yuhao. He was starting to find the path that belonged to him.</span></p>

He noticed the Emerald Swan wasn’t far from where he was when he raised his head. He had no idea when she had arrived.</span></p>

I didn’t notice her even with the sensitivity of my spiritual power.</span></p>

Huo Yuhao hurriedly got to his feet and returned her greeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black shadow drifted in from the center of the Water of Life. Di Tian’s appearance hadn’t changed since they’d last met, and he asked plainly, “Is everything prepared?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bi Ji nodded and said, “The people from Shrek have arrived. However, we have to hurry. I’m afraid our kinsmen won’t be able to control themselves.”</span></p>

He was already soaring through the sky when he regained his senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Probably only these few Savage Beasts dared to fly across the Great Star Dou Forest, and only the Beast God dared to fly so outrageously.</span></p>

Bi Ji, Huo Yuhao, and he were standing on these dark clouds as they soared towards the edge of the forest. They seemed like they were moving very slowly, but they were actually flying at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao was a little worried when Bi Ji mentioned that she was afraid her kinsmen couldn’t control themselves. Huo Yuhao understood what that meant; the Great Star Dou Forest’s soul beasts had just fought a violent battle against Shrek City, and both sides had suffered heavy losses. Under such circumstances, both parties definitely hated each other to the core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shrek Academy’s people were over at the Great Star Dou Forest’s edge, and it was possible that the soul beasts there would attack the humans because they couldn’t control their impulses.</span></p>

At least, he was faster than any soul tool that Huo Yuhao could think of. The dark clouds began to descend while these random thoughts were still spinning his head as cursing sounds and the howls of soul beasts rang out one after another in his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dull dragon roar echoed through the skies, and the sky darkened completely. The situation was a little messy a second ago, but it calmed down in the next moment.</span></p>

He turned around and faced the masses of soul beasts being led by the Bear Lord, the Myriad Demon King, and the Scarlet King.</span></p>
