 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

</div>
<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao’s expression changed slightly as he said hoarsely, “It’s not as serious as you make it out to be. Do you think evil soul masters are born evil? You and a great many other soul masters are wrong on this matter. The truth is, almost every evil soul master deserves pity, and that’s because the world shuns them due to their martial souls’ characteristics. They have had to go through much pain and bitterness in their earlier days, and that’s the reason why their personalities are a little extreme. I believe that if the Sun Moon Empire conquers the continent in the end and corrects the reputation of evil soul masters, everything will be different. They will control themselves, and as for who rules over the continent, that’s not something that I’m concerned about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao laughed, and his laughter was very disdainful. “Yes, perhaps what you said does make some sense. There are many evil soul masters who deserved pity when they were younger. However, they start killing people because they have received unfair treatment, and they use all kinds of evil methods to strengthen themselves. How can that be the right thing to do? I may not know about others, but let’s talk about the Death God Douluo, Ye Xishui. I am willing to call her my senior because of my teacher, but it seems like she’s the demon king among humanity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are not allowed to talk about Ye Xishui.” Long Xiaoyao’s eyes suddenly grew focused, and Huo Yuhao felt as if his body was held in place by some tremendous power. This frightening strength was pressing against his body, like he was about to be ground into dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he grit his teeth and held on as he said with difficulty, “Am I wrong? She’s the Death God Douluo, and she controls the Death God Pagoda. The reason why the Death God Pagoda is so powerful is because it incinerates people’s spirits when it fires at full strength, while thousands of spirits are burned through every time it fires. I saw it with my own eyes, and from what it looked like, there were at least tens of thousands of spirits inside. That means tens of thousands of lives! How many evil soul masters are there? Every single one of them is a life, but does this mean those people that they so mercilessly slaughtered are not considered lives? Ye Xishui hasn’t just been killing people. She has imprisoned their spirits, and she will ultimately incinerate their spirits for an attack, and eventually obliterate them. Are such brutal and cruel methods things you wish to see?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao fell silent after Huo Yuhao’s string of accusations. Of course, he knew that every single one of Huo Yuhao’s words was true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao heaved a faint sigh and shook his head. “I cannot turn back anymore. I am willing to do anything for Xishui, and the only thing I can do now is to restrain myself so that I don’t kill people. I’m not clear as to what the Holy Ghost Church has done, but I do know something. Xishui has told that after the continent is united, there will be a new order, and true peace will only happen when that time comes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao said nothing more. He knew that he could no longer move the Dragon Emperor Douluo. He stared coldly at him, but he was full of lamentations in his heart. But he still had some hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t fight against the Dragon Emperor Douluo by himself. However, he still had the Beast God’s reverse scale on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had managed to escape with his life from the Death God Douluo’s clutches with the reverse scale’s protection. The Beast God would naturally appear if Long Xiaoyao attacked him, and he felt absolutely threatened. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao now had his soul core, and the amount of energy his body could sustain was greatly boosted after he absorbed the Manifold Mysterious Ice Essence. Killing him wouldn’t be that easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao said plainly, “You’re hoping for the Beast God’s strength to protect you, eh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s eyes grew focused, but he said nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled faintly when he saw Huo Yuhao’s silent consent. “Youngster, I am actually very interested in you. You’re so young, yet you can reach such a cultivation rank. That is considered extremely prodigious. Xishui has long told me about your situation, and I definitely won’t make the same mistake. In front of an Ultimate Douluo, you can’t defend yourself just because you have some protective abilities. Furthermore…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao suddenly paused, and turned around towards a rooftop by the side of the street. He grabbed with his right hand through the air and said, “You’ve been watching for a while now. Come out, lady.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The quiet and dark world suddenly seemed to return to normal, and the sounds that Huo Yuhao couldn’t hear reappeared once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah!” A crisp exclamation rang out as a shadow was pulled from the sky by a formless strength, and this shadow fell not far behind Huo Yuhao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao felt a little relieved as the pressure Long Xiaoyao had unleashed against him vanished completely. He glanced backwards subconsciously, and this time, he was truly astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he couldn’t sense Long Xiaoyao’s presence, he also didn’t sense this person’s presence with Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection was powerful, but it still had a focus. For instance, Huo Yuhao would only pay first attention to strong soul power undulations when he was using Spiritual Detection over a large area. He naturally wouldn’t pay much attention to normal citizens who didn’t have any soul power undulations, since these people didn’t threaten him much anyway. If somebody deliberately suppressed their soul power in a group of people with the right method, Huo Yuhao would have a hard time finding them. But if his opponent wanted to attack him, his opponent would have to channel soul power and come closer to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was only one reason why he didn’t discover this person, and that was because this person was sufficiently familiar with him. This person knew about his Spiritual Detection, and this person had been hiding in the street beside the royal palace while concealing her soul power. She didn’t make any moves at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… why are you here?” Huo Yuhao’s voice was actually trembling, in contrast to his calmness before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wasn’t afraid at all if he faced against the Dragon Emperor Douluo by himself. The worst that could happen was death, and he had been at the borders of death countless times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But he could no longer keep his cool as he stared at this person in front of him, and that was because she looked identical to Dong’er. She was Tang Wutong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong didn’t land on the ground stably, but she wasn’t wretched enough to fall face-first to the ground. The Darkness Holy Dragon was still merciful to women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She stood up and stared calmly at Huo Yuhao. “Why can’t I be here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corner of Huo Yuhao’s mouth curved into a forced smile. There was nothing more to be said. They were facing the Darkness Holy Dragon; how could they just run away even if they wanted to? There was no more meaning to pursuing the reason behind why Tang Wutong was here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao smiled and said, “What a pretty little girl. She has been hiding by the side for a while, and she has considered attacking me more than once after I showed up, but she just couldn’t find an opportunity. With her around, I trust your Beast God’s powers won’t be that effective. Let’s find another place. This place is too noisy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long Xiaoyao waved his hand as he spoke, and everything descended into silence and darkness once more. Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong immediately felt a terrifying soul power undulation rise up in the next moment. This wave of soul power poured out in all directions, with them at the center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That formidable soul power was filled with darkness, but it was impossible to fight against. The soul power swept them up as the space around them began to contort. Huo Yuhao wanted to use Spiritual Detection to investigate what was going on, but his spiritual power couldn’t leave his body at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is this an Ultimate Douluo’s power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao’s cultivation was far from sufficient. However, he had encountered many top-tier individuals before, and his senses were extremely powerful. Huo Yuhao could faintly feel that the Darkness Holy Dragon’s cultivation was probably higher than Ye Xishui’s. They were both Ultimate Douluo, but the Darkness Holy Dragon’s pure fighting strength was probably stronger. He wondered if his teacher was stronger than the Darkness Holy Dragon when he was in his prime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong subconsciously arrived beside Huo Yuhao, and grabbed his arm nervously. Huo Yuhao turned back towards her as he channeled his soul power to protect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong looked at him and asked, “Do you really want to know why I’m here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao forced a laugh and said, “Do you really think that holds any meaning anymore? Why didn’t you run when you saw the Darkness Holy Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why should I run? Tang Wutong said plainly, “Furthermore, do you really think I could escape? His senses are different from your Spiritual Detection. You detect things as a whole, but his senses are very fine and delicate. When he appeared and discovered you while you were using Imitation, he naturally discovered me as well. I couldn’t escape even if I wanted to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao heaved a sigh and said, “Then why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong said, “Eldest senior brother was worried about you, and after Qiuqiu returned, he asked someone to go and bring you to go back as quickly as possible. He didn’t want you to continue searching for Tang Ya, and I am the messenger. I heard Nan Qiuqiu’s report about your travels, and I figured that you’d be looking for intel inside Heaven Dou City, so here I am. I just heard about that tremendous explosion inside the royal palace, so I began to search for your tracks. See, I only managed to find you just now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao didn’t know what to say. Could he say that Tang Wutong was unlucky? But for some reason, he felt very safe and secure when he saw her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Darkness Holy Dragon seems like he has some way to block the Beast God’s strength. Am I going to die with Tang Wutong here today? That’s not so bad. At least, even though she isn’t Dong’er, she looks exactly like her. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong glanced at him and said, “What are you thinking about? Are you trying to escape?”</span></p>
