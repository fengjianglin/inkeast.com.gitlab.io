 <p><strong>Book 9: Escape</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 62.1: The Chaotic Preliminaries</strong></p>
 <p>How exactly could a chaotic battle involving several tens of people be conducted? Considering that the participants ranged second- to fifth-year students, there was inevitably a large gap in their cultivations. This difference wasn’t something that could just be made up with numbers.</p>
 <p>Even if five or six people were to simultaneously attack Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, and the rest, they still wouldn’t be able to take them down! As such, almost everyone began to form alliances once the battle had started.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao didn’t form a team with the other Class 1 students. First off, they couldn’t be considered to be well coordinated. Second, all of them were only second year students. In a chaotic battle such as this, they wouldn’t have any chance at winning even if they all teamed up.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s first choice was to find his senior brother, as it was cooling to rest under a large tree.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei naturally understood Huo Yuhao’s intention, as he growled, “Sanshi, Nannan, let’s work together.” All three of them were fifth year students with four soul rings; it would be extremely easy for them to be attacked from all sides. Furthermore, their relationship was extremely subtle. A large number of people thought that Bei Bei and Xu Sanshi were rivals, yet in reality they were extremely good friends. At the same time, even though Jiang Nannan didn’t have a deep connection with them, she naturally wouldn’t make a bad decision considering their situation. Moreover, she was good friends with Tang Ya.</p>
 <p>Other than Huo Yuhao’s group, who’d decided to make do by themselves, the other students had all looked for companions that were near them. Dai Huabin, Xie Huanyue, and Zhu Lu naturally decided to form a team together. Afterwards, they dragged their classmate Wu Feng and the nearby Ning Tian into their team in order to form a small, five-man team.</p>
 <p>The other third and fourth year students formed their own teams, while the Lan sisters naturally formed a team with Huang Chutian. On the other hand, Zhou Sichen and Cao Jinxuan decided to follow Huo Yuhao’s trio, and rushed towards Bei Bei. The two of them were extremely clever; when they’d witnessed Huo Yuhao reveal his astonishing amount of talent, they’d naturally understood that, at the very least, no harm would come from following him. Unfortunately, they weren’t him, nor did they possess something like his soul thruster. The two of them were immediately left behind as soon as he accelerated with the use of his soul thruster.</p>
 <p>Of everyone present, the only person who hadn’t found a team was the tall and sturdy He Caitou, who was also the only core disciple from the Soul Tool Department participating in the event.</p>
 <p>While the others scrambled to form teams, he stood there like a steel machine. A large number of tube-shaped pieces of metal began to appear all over his body, which caused him to resemble an enormous steel hedgehog. Despite the many tubes that had appeared, the most terrifying things on his body were still the two enormous, thigh-sized cannons on his shoulders. Even if some of the students from the Martial Soul Department didn’t know that they were stationary soul tools, they were still able to sense a terrifying sensation of crisis from them.</p>
 <p>He Caitou had followed Fan Yu for a long period of time, as Fan Yu was the who’d brought him to Shrek Academy. The instant that the large number of soul tools appeared all over his body, two yellow and two purple soul rings rose up from beneath him and simultaneously lit up. Impressively, he’d managed to become a Soul Ancestor-ranked expert.</p>
 <p>After all of the metallic tubes had emerged from his body, He Caitou mercilessly launched a volley of attacks towards the area that held the largest number of people...</p>
 <p>Over twenty beams of light suddenly emerged from his body towards his target, and the ripples of soul power that instantaneously exploded outwards stunned everyone present.</p>
 <p>Zhou Sichen and Cao Jianxuan were the most unlucky of those he’d targeted, as they had to bear the brunt of the terrifying volley of light. The barrage of attacks he sent towards them came too suddenly, and moved too fast for them to dodge. Furthermore, as an attack launched from a soul tool, it hadn’t had any starting signs. This was also their first time facing one, thus they were somewhat stunned for a brief period of time.</p>
 <p>The moment they were about to be hit, the two of them felt their bodies suddenly lighten. Immediately afterwards, they felt themselves soar into the sky and vanish from the battlefield.</p>
 <p>“The two of you are eliminated.” The smell of alcohol assaulted their noses as Zhou Sichen and Cao Jianxuan’s found that, to their astonishment, they were now hovering in the air beside Elder Xuan, and a faint halo of light had covered their bodies.</p>
 <p>A loud explosion then rang out from the ground beneath them.</p>
 <p>The might of twenty soul tools was simply astonishing. Amidst the violent explosions, everyone other than Zhou Sichen and Cao Jianxuan—who’d been directly eliminated—hastily dodged to the side.</p>
 <p>He Caitou hadn’t launched his attack for nothing. In fact, he’d done it for the sake of his little junior brother. If he hadn’t, why would his attack have perfectly collided with Zhou Sichen and Cao Jinxuan? Huo Yuhao made use of He Caitou’s covering fire to smoothly reach Bei Bei’s group of three with Wang Dong and Xiao Xiao.</p>
 <p>“Senior brother He, this way.” Huo Yuhao waved towards He Caitou once he’d reached Bei Bei, then immediately began to release his powerful auxiliary abilities.</p>
 <p>Huo Yuhao’s eyes lit up with a faint golden color as his Spiritual Detection Sharing instantly enveloped Wang Dong, Xiao Xiao, Bei Bei, Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, and He Caitou.</p>
 <p>Of the six of them, Xu Sanshi and Jiang Nannan were the only ones who hadn’t experienced Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection before. As such, the two of them were immediately astonished when they were enveloped by it.</p>
 <p>It had to be known that his Spiritual Detection would grow even stronger as his cultivation increased. Even though it couldn’t yet envelop the entire battlefield, it could still cover a large portion of it. A three-dimensional image appeared in all of their minds, afterwhich every single action their surrounding opponents were taking or were about to take was transmitted into their minds via the analysis of Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection. This wonderful sensation of total control was something that no soul master would refuse.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei gave Huo Yuhao a big thumbs up, then took a large step forward. He stamped the ground with his right foot, which caused a loud ‘boom’ to ring out. The sonorous cry of a dragon rang out from his body as he activated the mighty Blue Lightning Tyrant Dragon.</p>
 <p>Xu Sanshi also took a step forward, and a dense flow of black air swirled around his body as he raised his enormous Shield of the Xuanwu Turtle. However, when he did so, his expression suddenly became strange.</p>
 <p>“Bei Bei, did you use this when you won that Mysterious Water Pill from me? I was wondering how you’d become that fierce. You were cheating.”</p>
 <p>Bei Bei shot a glance towards the indignant Xu Sanshi, then replied indifferently, “Either way, my junior brother has already eaten it. What’re you gonna do about it?”</p>
 <p>“I’ll settle things with you once we’ve finished this up,” Xu Sanshi retorted angrily.</p>
 <p>Next to Bei Bei, who was standing in front alongside Xu Sanshi, stood Jiang Nannan. On the other hand, He Caitou stood behind Bei Bei, while Xiao Xiao and Wang Dong stood next to each other behind him. The last in line was Huo Yuhao.</p>
 <p>“We only have seven people, just the right amount.” Huo Yuhao’s quiet voice rang through the ears of everyone near him. The meaning behind his words was clear; only seven people could pass, and they had seven people in their team. As such, they wouldn’t have to distract themselves with any infighting.</p>
 <p>“Make your move!” Bei Bei let out a low shout, then took large strides forwards. He had a plentiful amount of battle experience, and it would be impossible for the four Soul Ancestors on their team to not attract any intention. As soon as the others noticed that they’d teamed up, they’ld undoubtedly gather all of their strength in order to attack them. Right now was the best time for them to strike in order to gain the upper hand.</p>
 <p>However, every single participant was a core disciple. As such, none of them were dumb. The instant that Bei Bei took a step forward, a fourth year core disciple let out a loud shout, “Everyone, let’s combine our strengths to deal with that team of four-ringed seniors!”</p>
 <p>The words ‘four-ringed seniors’ were extremely effective towards getting the other eighteen student’s attention. When they heard that person’s reminder, all of them immediately came to their senses and rapidly closed in on Bei Bei’s team.</p>
 <p>Seven versus eighteen? Everyone present was a core disciple! Even though Bei Bei’s team had four Soul Ancestors, Huo Yuhao, Wang Dong, and Xiao Xiao were still slightly weaker than them. They simply didn’t have any chance of winning.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei immediately made a quick decision, stopped his charge, and shot to the right. When he did so, Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection transmitted Bei Bei’s intention to all of the members in their team.</p>
 <p>There were a total of six students from two teams to the right, all of whom were third year students. At that moment, they simultaneously released their martial souls. All of them were three-ringed experts, and all of them had an optimum combination of two yellow soul rings and one purple soul ring.</p>
 <p>Their reactions were extremely quick, as each of them attempted to release their respective soul skills concurrently. However, they suddenly felt their minds go blurry for a second, which caused their movements to slow by half a beat.</p>
 <p>They couldn’t tell who’d made a move, but Huo Yuhao’s companions—who were under the effect of his Spiritual Detection Sharing—could sense that he’d released a soul skill.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei took the lead and charged mightily into the six soul master’s formation, but he was immediately met by two assault-type soul masters.</p>
 <p>The long hair of the person on the left turned orange, and his body doubled in size. His martial soul turned out to be the King of the Beasts: The Lion. Immediately afterwards, a pair of enormous palms met Bei Bei’s charge. The martial soul of the person on the right was a lance, which turned into a ray of light as it shot towards Bei Bei’s chest like a viper. Evidently this wasn’t their first time working together. With one person standing in the front and the other person attacking from behind, they were extremely well coordinated. The lance-wielding soul master who was in the back made his move last, but his attack arrived first; his sharp lance shot straight towards Bei Bei’s body.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei wasn’t afraid in the slightest as he faced their attacks. He let out a shout, and countless electric serpents surged from his body. They didn’t just envelop the two soul masters in front of him, they also enveloped the other four soul masters behind them.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the poignant sound of a flute rang out, which caused the speed of everyone that wasn’t on Huo Yuhao’s team to decrease. Xiao Xiao had chosen to release her Ninephoenix Worshipping Flute at the most appropriate time.</p>
 <p>Bei Bei grabbed the sharp lance that was approaching him with his left dragon claw, which created an intense flurry of sparks. He then swept out with his right claw and sent the three-ringed assault-type master with the Lion martial soul flying.</p>
 <p>Jiang Nannan jumped into the air soundlessly as this happened. She was simply too quick, such that even her figure couldn’t be seen. She chose to make her move, aided by Huo Yuhao’s Spiritual Detection, at the perfect time. The instant that the soul master who possessed the Lion martial soul flew into the air, his neck was clamped between her legs. She then twisted her waist and sent him flying away from their team.</p>
