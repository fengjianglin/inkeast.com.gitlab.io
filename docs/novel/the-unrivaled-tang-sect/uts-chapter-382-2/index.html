Naturally, Huo Yuhao would be at his weakest during this period of time as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He relied completely on the physical strength of a Soul Emperor to cross the city walls. Combined with his Spiritual Interference, he was able to leave the city without alerting anyone. He was now lying by the moat to slowly recover his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the terrifying explosion caused by the Class 8 stationary soul cannon occurred, he’d nearly removed the seal placed on his soul power. Only then did he quietly submerge himself into the water and dig his way into the water prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time around, what he used was his physical body and not his spiritual avatar. Once he entered the water prison, it wouldn’t be easy for him to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao performed a cursory observation of the water prison with his spiritual power. Very quickly, he discovered the lively soul power contained within the various soul masters and soul engineers it held. Even if they weren’t fully recovered, they had enough strength to fight one battle, at least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao held on to the metal railings of the water prison with a single hand and used the other to push against the water in the moat. A jade-green light rose from his body, and the little Snow Lady quietly appeared by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The current Snow Lady was already a big kid who looked around eight or nine. A noble and cold look had already replaced her originally cute face, making her seem much like the original Snow Lady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An extremely chilly intent instantly spread outwards, freezing the moat outside at a speed that the naked eye could see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little Snow Lady nodded softly towards Huo Yuhao, then gently twisted about in the water to reach the depths of the moat. Unexpectedly, one could see snowflakes fluttering around her, even underwater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moat, which was originally flowing vigorously, had been blocked by a wall of ice after a short period of time. The area of this wall of ice then covered both sides of the moat at an astonishing speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Snow Lady here, Huo Yuhao simply didn’t need to do anything. With a wave of his right hand, the Darkgolden Terrorclaws shot out and noiselessly tore the metal railings apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His use of Ultimate Ice was perfect. Just like how the water in the water prison wouldn’t flow outwards, the extreme cold within it wouldn’t diffuse out either. Otherwise, a large problem could occur if they were to freeze everyone within the water prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After quietly submerging and swimming around in the water, Huo Yuhao began to spread his spiritual power out to cover the entirety of the water prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the evil soul masters within the water prison were somewhat nervous. The Zhong brothers were huddled together on another side of the water prison, which was also its true entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Never in their wildest dreams would they have imagined that somebody would enter the water prison via the moat under the surveillance of so many soul detectors on the southern city walls. From what they were aware of, the moat water still contained the extremely toxic Soul Exterminating Powder. If a soul master was to swim within the water, their soul power would quickly be dispersed. What threat would they be able to pose then?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao’s spiritual power deliberately avoided the area where the Zhong brothers were and even the hostages who were by their side. For the sake of preventing any accidents, it was sufficient to inform a large number of people, but not all, of what was going to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, make your preparations.” Huo Yuhao’s thoughts were quickly transmitted into the minds of the hostages by way of his Spiritual Detection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The hostages, who’d been acting as though they were weak all this while, immediately felt their spirits rise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, they were already doing their best to hold themselves back after recovering their soul power. Although there were quite a few evil soul masters here, they were insignificant compared to the number of hostages held here. They were still somewhat fearful of the two evil Titled Douluo from before, but the number of evil soul masters left here was clearly much less than before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Were it not for the elders restraining them, some of the younger hostages would’ve been unable to stop themselves from trying to escape. After being held captive here for a few months, the gloominess pent up in their hearts could be imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t tell them what the signal to move was, because there was simply no need for that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">--------</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the patrolling soldiers were staring at the northern city. The brilliant golden light that had risen into the air had finally started to disperse, though there were still sparks faintly flying about along the walls of the eastern and western city. The sounds of the violent explosions from those areas made the atmosphere in the Southern City extraordinarily tense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many of the soldiers stationed there felt inwardly happy. Fortunately, nothing had happened to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you looking at? Get to your places, what are you doing?!” A strict voice suddenly rang out. As he started shouting, the various soldiers rushed back to their positions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander, take a look at this. This, what is this?” A soldier in charge of a soul detector cried out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm?” The originally angry commander quickly ran over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s the situation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander, there are undulations of soul power. However, we can’t see anyone at all!” The soldier pointed at the simple soul screen in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Large, greenish ripples were floating about on the screen in front of him. This signified that there was an extremely strong and wide undulation of soul power in the city below him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is…” The commander was at a loss as well. He immediately took a look at the other soul detectors around him and discovered that they were all inactive. Nor did he discover any life signs of any living creatures. Only the soul detector in front of him had produced this result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Commander, you’d better come over here!” Another soldier at a different area cried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What now?” The commander quickly rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The soldier pointed at the screen in front of him, dumbstruck, “My thermal soul tool seems to have malfunctioned! It’s showing that the temperature underground is dropping madly! How, how can this be?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The temperature of the ground beneath us is dropping?” The commander quickly stretched his head to look down the wall, and the soldier next to him turned on a soul lamp to light up the area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The city walls around Sunrise City weren’t too tall. When the light from the soul lamp illuminated the moat, the commander finally discovered what the problem was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He suddenly let out an ear-piercing screech, “Enemy attack!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why would the moat suddenly freeze for no reason? He himself was a soul master, and he could guess the reason for this. Only a soul master could cause an astonishing phenomenon like this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, he’d made his discovery too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The water prison. When the little Snow Lady quietly returned to Huo Yuhao’s body, his eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body shook slightly, and the soul thrusters on his back caused Huo Yuhao to shoot out from the water with a whoosh.</span></p>

The other entrance of the water prison, which was where Huo Yuhao had entered, had already been blown apart.</span></p>
