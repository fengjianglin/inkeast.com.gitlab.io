 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they had attacked with all their might earlier, it was likely that very few soul engineers within the protective soul barrier would have survived. The two soul engineer legions might even have been completely wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong didn’t do so. They had a more far-sighted plan. This plan was much more significant for destroying the entire Sun Moon Empire army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao had controlled the snow and used his Ice Explosion Technique. As for how he managed to force the soul engineers to rise into the sky, he had actually in fact only used a part of the strength of his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao had really wanted to wipe them out, he would have fully unleashed his Snowy Dance of Ultimate Ice as the soul engineers rose into the sky. The soul engineers were in groups of ten. Very few of them would have been able to resist such a strong attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Huo Yuhao didn’t do that. He only used his Ice Explosion Technique to destroy a few small teams. At the same time, he quickly snuck in as a few of the small teams revealed flaws. He killed two of them and used his Imitation and Spiritual Interference Domain to successfully blend in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the linked defensive barrier was fully unleashed, he had actually achieved his goal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Huo Yuhao were an ordinary Transcendent Douluo, it wouldn’t be easy for him to kill a Class 9 soul engineer so easily. However, he already had his second soul core right now, his Ultimate Ice second soul core. This meant that he could directly tap into the strength of his second soul core. The deep-blue whirlpool earlier had been a physical manifestation of the strength of his second soul core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Ultimate Ice soul core combined with his Snowless Glacier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All it took was one palm strike to kill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tianyuan was killed almost instantly. Then, Huo Yuhao calmly fled with Tang Wutong. He used his Spiritual Blast instead of his Spiritual Tempest. He was already being very merciful. This was because he needed to conserve energy for them to return. They became one of the factors causing instability in the Sun Moon Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he left something special before he left. This left a deeper impression in the minds of these Sun Moon Empire soul engineers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flying inside the protective soul barrier had stopped by now. The remaining soul engineers in the two soul engineer legions were only half their original number.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen’s expression couldn’t just be considered gloomy anymore. He was even in a bit of a daze. He had some understanding of Xu Tianyuan’s abilities. As a Class 9 soul engineer, Xu Tianyuan was equipped with the best soul tools, even though he wasn’t the strongest himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had human-shaped soul tools, automatic defensive soul tools and the treasure of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion on him. Wait a minute, where’s the treasure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Xuanchen immediately realized an important problem. His eyes brightened, and he quickly searched for it inside the barrier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the linked defensive barrier, Xu Tianyuan’s belongings would still remain even if his body blew apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xia Xuanchen immediately turned very grim when he couldn’t find anything after searching for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s gone? The treasure of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion is gone. This means that our enemies have taken it. This also means that those who attacked us were here for the treasure, rather than to kill us.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes! Evil soul masters pursued such objectives!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, someone’s heavy breathing jolted Xia Xuanchen awake. He subconsciously looked to his surroundings. He was stunned to find out that more than ten soul engineers had turned completely pale. However, their eyes were blood-red. Their auras were also very heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not good. It’s the ability of evil soul masters. They’ve been controlled. Kill them!” Xia Xuanchen shouted, and made a move first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few more breaths, Xia Xuanchen’s furious roars echoed in the barrier. “Bastards. Holy Ghost Church, I’ll not let you off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, Tang Wutong sighed. “Yuhao, I feel a little uncomfortable inside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao hugged her slender waist. “I know. However, this is war. People die in wars. In fact, even though I meddled with their bodies, they should be able to recover on their own after some time. I can only try my best not to kill using necromancy. Do you think I’ve become crueler?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Wutong gently shook her head and said, “No, you’re right. War is cruel. If our enemies don’t die, you will be the one to die. If we kill one more soul engineer from the other party, we can save lives on our side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao sighed and revealed a glow on his face. He coldly said, “Ju Zi was right. I was too soft in the past. This is war. If we want to control and change it, we need to change these habits. However, fret not. I’ll try to stay true to my heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, I’ve been misunderstanding in the past. Wutong, losing to Ju Zi on the battlefield is actually very normal. This is because our overall abilities are some way off from the Sun Moon Empire. That’s why we’ve always been led by the nose by Ju Zi. However, this doesn’t mean that we don’t stand a chance. If we can’t succeed overtly, we can only scheme. We can only use other ways to defeat them if we can’t beat them openly. This is what I can do as an Ultimate Soldier. Let’s go. We should return and see how things are in Dou Ling City. I hope we can help them achieve stability and minimize any chaos.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Tang Wutong nodded, and they turned around and flew in the direction of Dou Ling City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They retreated, but the remaining members of the two soul engineer legions were still leaving slowly. They were all filled with rage, like a soul cannon shell. They could blow apart at any time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dou Ling City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong returned to Dou Ling City, they were stunned to realize that smoke was no longer billowing from the city. Furthermore, the overall situation seemed to be rather stable too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky had turned dark by now. There wasn’t anyone on the streets, but there were many soldiers patrolling. Evidently, there was a curfew in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this. He led Tang Wutong as they silently entered the city. At the same time, he unleashed his Spiritual Detection to find his teammates.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The area his Spiritual Detection could cover was simply too big under the effect of his twin soul cores. Although it wasn’t enough to cover the entire city, they were still able to quickly find traces of Xu Sanshi and the others, given their speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finding them was also very easy. This was because Xu Sanshi and the others were close to the ruins of the imperial palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had been there for ten hours.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao directly communicated with Xu Sanshi using his Spiritual Detection. At the same time, he brought Tang Wutong towards them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lights flashed, and Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong silently appeared beside Xu Sanshi, Jiang Nannan, Ye Guyi, Nan Qiuqiu and Ji Juechen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They weren’t the only five here right now. There were a lot of people standing in the ruins of the imperial palace. Many of them were still wearing armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When two people suddenly appeared, they reacted very agitatedly. Suddenly, soul power undulations surged, and many people unleashed their martial souls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sanshi lifted his hand and said, “They’re on our side. They’re my juniors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao was astonished to discover that Xu Sanshi sounded very awe-inspiring. After hearing his words, the soldiers and soul masters calmed down. However, they were still shocked to see Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yes!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How did these two get in? How did no one noticed them? What kind of powers do they possess?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao seemed to be asking Xu Sanshi something with his eyes. Xu Sanshi also turned his head to look at him. When he saw Xu Sanshi’s eyes, Huo Yuhao’s heart sank. His eyes had turned red, and the whites of his eyes were filled with streaks of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Huo Yuhao’s first time seeing such a situation. Normally, Xu Sanshi was very happy-go-lucky. Among the members of Shrek’s Seven Monsters, he was definitely the clown. He was very strong, but he shared a good relationship with everyone else. He was even like Jiang Nannan’s punching bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But right now, Xu Sanshi released a strong killing intent from his body. His entire demeanor had changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little junior, how are those soul engineers?” Xu Sanshi asked. His voice also sounded very hoarse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Yuhao replied, “The two soul engineer legions were the Imperial Dragon and Evileye Tyrant Soul Engineer Legions. We killed half of them, including the legion commander of the Imperial Dragon Soul Engineer Legion. The rest fled. However, they don’t know that we are the ones who ambushed them. Under my guise, they should have mistaken evil soul masters as the culprits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, thanks Yuhao.” Xu Sanshi nodded and turned his head again. Not only did his killing intent not go down, but it was even trending towards a rise.</span></p>
