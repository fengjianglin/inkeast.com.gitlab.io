He felt that the power that terrified him so wasn’t very strong and couldn’t cause any harm. However, the element that it contained was very scary. It caused his beast soul to be instantly engulfed in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “This is the power of light. Light is used to remove darkness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Peng shouted, “Rubbish! What do you know about the power of light? Even if it’s light, it wouldn’t make my beast souls terrified.” He didn’t mention that he was also extremely fearful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao didn’t explain anything. Facts spoke louder than words. Without a doubt, he had won the bet he’d made with the Dragon Emperor Douluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he made to step away, Long Xiaoyao arrived in front of him. This time, he was more focused as he looked at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It isn’t just the power of light. There seems to be a special force that can frighten spirits. I’ve lost. I’ll uphold the agreement and spare all three of you. However, can you tell me what the force you just used is called? Even Mu En didn’t seem to possess it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao couldn’t possibly lie in front of the Dragon Emperor Douluo, and thus said subconsciously, “It’s a purifying force.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes, it was a purifying force—the jinx of all spirits. No matter what evil spirit, it would be fearful and dissipate in the face of a purifying force once it lost its original body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Huo Yuhao’s cultivation, he couldn’t threaten the Scorpion Tiger Douluo and other Transcendent Douluo even if he unleashed his purifying force against them. However, this purifying force caused all those beast souls to subconsciously feel fear. No matter how weak the purifying force was, it still contained the aura of purification! Once a beast soul encountered this aura, it would cause irrevocable harm. Furthermore, Huo Yuhao had even borrowed the strength of sunlight, and this purifying force wasn’t too shoddy itself. It was possible for him to harm one or two soul beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like teacher, like disciple. Electrolux’s proficiency in necromancy was undoubted. Why? Because he was a light-type necromancer! Furthermore, he possessed the purest powers of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao wasn’t a light-type soul master, but his spiritual power was great. He could temporarily control the power of light with Electrolux’s incantations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Purifying force. What an impressive purifying force. I didn’t expect that you had such a talent. However, you don’t seem to be a light-type soul master.” Long Xiaoyao revealed a weird look of admiration in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scorpion Tiger Douluo didn’t get closer, but Xian Lin’er didn’t pursue him. She quickly returned to Yan Shaozhe’s side and took a look at Long Xiaoyao. Her eyes were still filled with terror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she had been involved with fighting Zhang Peng earlier, she could clearly see when Long Xiaoyao appeared. She could also hear Yan Shaozhe’s words. At that point in time, her heart sank. The Dragon Emperor Douluo was just too reputable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no one would have expected such a change. She had managed to beat the Scorpion Tiger Douluo with Huo Yuhao’s help, and even injured him. Xian Lin’er believed that she and Yan Shaozhe could resist the Dragon Emperor Douluo for awhile, even if they couldn’t beat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao asked Long Xiaoyao, “One can’t use the strength of light if one isn’t a light-type soul master? Whose rule is that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao chortled and said, “Interesting. Interesting. Those sounds that you made with your mouth. They must have gathered the power of the light element. It’s my first time seeing something like this. Let’s go, little fellow. Show me how much more you can surprise me.” As he spoke, he flew downwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe and Xian Lin’er heaved a sigh of relief. They understood that this meant that they had passed this barrier. Even if Huo Yuhao lost his bet, they would only lose the materials. Their lives wouldn’t be in any danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he turned to the two deans, Huo Yuhao looked apologetic. “Sorry, Dean Yan and Dean Xian. I didn’t expect to give the both of you so much trouble. I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yan Shaozhe waved his hand and said, “No, what will come will come. Even if it’s not this time, the Dragon Emperor Douluo would appear sooner or later. It’s also better to meet him earlier—at least we’ll have more time to prepare. You’ve already surprised us. Don’t push yourself too hard later. While the rare metals are precious, they aren’t essential. We’ll have a chance to obtain them again. This Dragon Emperor Douluo is at least credible and trustworthy. Just do your best. He won’t hurt you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright.” Huo Yuhao nodded, and the three of them flew down together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Scorpion Tiger Douluo came beside Long Xiaoyao and said, “Dragon Emperor, this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyao glanced at him and stopped him from speaking any further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I’ll follow your instructions.” Zhang Peng retreated a few steps and looked at Huo Yuhao. His eyes flashed, as if he were thinking of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Xiaoyo looked at Huo Yuhao and smiled. He said, “Come on, little fellow. I’ll let you strike me three times. Just unleash all your abilities. I won’t retaliate. If you can make me move even slightly, or make me summon the strength of my martial soul, I’ll concede defeat. How about that? I’ll only use soul power of the same rank to defend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao nodded and slowly shut his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the sound of it, he seemed to be at an advantage. The Dragon Emperor Douluo was only going to use Soul King-level soul power, and wouldn’t even retaliate. But in fact, Huo Yuhao knew how terrifying the abilities of such transcendent individuals were after he had faced Tai Tan. Even if he didn’t use higher-ranked soul power, his body was still at the level of an Ultimate Douluo! His spiritual power was the same too. That couldn’t be weakened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why Huo Yuhao knew that his Spirit Eyes’ spiritual-type soul skills were going to be useless against him. He could only use force to make him move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xian Lin’er seemed to be asking Yan Shaozhe something with her eyes. Yan Shaozhe replied, “Trust him. This kid knows what to do. He must have some confidence, since he’s dared to bet with the Dragon Emperor Douluo. If he told you that he could have helped you to defeat the Scorpion Tiger Douluo earlier, would you have believed him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xian Lin’er shook her head and replied, “Whatever it is, we have to protect this kid. Elder Mu was right. He is Shrek’s future hope. In a few years, he will become another protector of Shrek like the Dragon God Douluo.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. Even if it costs my life, I won’t let anyone harm my little junior. Teacher entrusted him to me.” Yan Shaozhe’s gaze became very determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Elder Mu passed away, his character had changed greatly. While the Soul Tool Department experienced a rise, he had also developed several changes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao stood there quietly and started to experience changes. He quickly turned into an entirely different entity as he stood there calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Emperor Douluo nodded. Huo Yuhao had merged with heaven and earth. Even though he was still young, he had already managed to reach such a level. Elder Mu had indeed nurtured an outstanding disciple! Although his soul power rank was a little weak for his age, he seemed to be walking a different cultivation path. He was first increasing his spiritual power before he increased his soul power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dim layer of golden light surfaced on Huo Yuhao’s body. The golden light wasn’t very strong, but the four Titled Douluo’s eyes brightened when they saw it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They all had keen eyes, and could tell what it was. This was a sign of an external manifestation of spiritual power. It was their first time seeing a Soul King doing something like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were even more shocked after this. The golden light on Huo Yuhao’s body started to become thicker and thicker, while his aura kept on becoming stronger and stronger. A layer of golden fog started to rise from his body. He was accumulating his power frenetically. His soul power was compressed as it fused with his spiritual power.</span></p>
