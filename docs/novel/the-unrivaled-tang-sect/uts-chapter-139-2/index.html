He reached his hand over to the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear, then revealed an excited look. He formed a knife-like stance with his hand, then amputated the bear’s right forelimb. He dug through it, unearthing a weird-looking bone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bone was dark gold, and intense undulations of soul power emanated from it. It was a soul bone. Xiao Xiao’s luck wasn’t just simply good—it was tremendously good!</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this soul bone was different from conventional right arm soul bones. To be precise, it was a right palm bone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bone wasn’t large, but 5 long blades were on top of it. They were akin to a smaller version of the terrorclaws. The blades seemed like a kind of divine weapon as dark golden halos revolved around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan was shocked and envious, “You guys are really lucky! It’s quite natural for a soul bone to emerge from a rare soul beast like the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear, but I never expected that it would leave behind its most valuable right palm soul bone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three of them were already in the second grade,thus they’d already learned some stuff about soul masters and soul beasts. However, it wasn’t possible for them to know everything, thus Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong looked to Elder Xuan with curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan showed them the right palm bone and said, “The strongest attack at a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s disposal comes from its terrorclaws. This bear was a juvenile, this it couldn’t unleash the full potential of their terrorclaws. However, I once came across a hundred thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear in my youth. I remember that, when it swiped its claws, hundred meter long blades would fly out. Back then, I believed that even giant dragons would be torn to shreds in front of such an attack. In the Sea God’s Pavilion there’s a memoir of an elder’s research on Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears. It has highly detailed information about Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Their terrorclaws may seem the same, but their right claw is in fact stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In fact, it’s far more powerful. The memoir also notes the four Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear soul bones that have appeared in the past. The elder discovered that only the arm bones have offensive capabilities like the terrorclaws, while the rest—while still good—only bolstered one’s defensive capabilities. But neither the left nor right arm bones’ terrorclaw soul skills were even able to come close to matching the real Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. Successfully hunting a ten thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear is very rare, as at that point even a Titled Douluo will find it difficult to win. As such, the terrorclaw soul skills in the arm soul bones have always had their limits, even though they’re very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Coincidentally that same elder met with a soul master who possessed a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear soul bone, who became a renowned soul master after only a few years. This elder from our academy was also pretty famous, and was even a Transcendent Douluo. He traded information with that soul master and promised to keep their secret, which in turn allowed him the chance to learn more about the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s soul bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The rarest soul bone from a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear is the palm bone as it would turn out, which also has the strongest soul skill. More importantly, the soul skill develops alongside the soul bone just like an actual Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. That soul master had obtained a left palm bone and was famed for his dark left hand—he even had the title of Darkleft Douluo. This time you managed to obtain a right palm bone! Which is the highest rank soul bone you can get from a Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. Palm bones are different from arm bones, they’re almost considered external soul bones. It’s best to find a suitable arm soul bone to go along with it so that the fusion isn’t problematic. The only pity is that this Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear only had two thousand years of cultivation, thus this right palm bone needs time to develop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong realized just how extraordinary this palm bone was after hearing Elder Xuan’s description. It was especially eye-opening for them, as they recalled how this Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear had clawed at Elder Xuan earlier. Their faces grew heated at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong took the lead and asked when he saw Elder Xuan looking at them seriously, “Elder Xuan, I already have both left and right arm bones. Judging from what you said, one should fuse with this palm bone before a right arm bone. As such it’s wasted on me; I’ll give up on it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao said, “Elder Xuan, you know that I’m the leader amongst the three of us. Xiao Xiao is the only girl, and she isn’t strong offensively. But if she gets this palm bone, she’ll be good at both attacking and defending. Furthermore, she’s fusing with the soul ring of the Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear as we speak. As they say, ladies first. I’ll leave it to her. I believe that our luck will hold out in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan felt comforted seeing how generous they were. “Kids, I’ll have you know that the value of this right palm bone isn’t inferior to a hundred thousand year soul bone! Once it fully develops, it’ll be even more valuable than an ordinary hundred thousand year soul bone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao smiled and said, “Wang Dong can’t fuse with it, and I can’t be too greedy, since I already have the Ice Jade Scorpion Left Arm Bone! Moreover, it really suits Xiao Xiao. We’re all Shrek’s Seven Monsters, so we’ll share what’s needed with those of us that need it. We can maximize our potential better this way, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan looked at him sincerely and nodded slightly. He said, “Then I shall thank you on Xiao Xiao’s behalf.” He was selfish at heart and really wanted to give this soul bone to Xiao Xiao—she was his personal disciple after all, and he was truly fond of her. He could tell that, in terms of talent, Xiao Xiao lagged behind Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong. But if she could fuse with this soul bone, then she could close the gap between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But he couldn’t make that decision of his. As an elder and a teacher of the academy, he knew that Huo Yuhao had been the first to attack the thousand year Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear. However, Huo Yuhao hadn’t taken the soul ring. If Elder Xuan bluntly gave the soul bone to Xiao Xiao as well, then that would be pushing it. It was beyond his expectations that Xiao Xiao would obtain this soul ring without his interference.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But it was different if Huo Yuhao offered to give up the palm bone. Not only was such a decision much to Elder Xuan’s delight, but it also made him respect Huo Yuhao more. It wasn’t strange that Elder Mu regarded him so highly; he was very compassionate. Huo Yuhao was bound to become the center of the Shrek’s Seven Devils in the future if he developed properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao and Wang Dong could relax with Elder Xuan around, thus they sat close to Xiao Xiao and began cultivating and restoring their soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their confidence soared after finding a suitable soul ring for Xiao Xiao on their first day.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their soul power was fully restored after a while, and the sky had turned dark. Huo Yuhao felt like chuckling as he looked at Elder Xuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan had used a thick tree branch to form a fire pit as they were cultivating. He’d then skinned a chunk of Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear meat and washed it clean before skewering it on a tree branch. He’d also prepared firewood and even displayed more than 10 condiments to one side. When he saw Elder Xuan looking at him hopefully, Huo Yuhao immediately understood what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

This bear’s meat is extremely delicious, especially the palm meat. It’s considered one of the top 10 delicacies in the world. I leave the palm meat to you; freeze it for now, and we can find some top quality honey to cook it with when we return.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s also very nourishing, so we can let Elder Mu try it too. We’ll feast on the rest of the meat. The three of you are still growing, so you can have some more meat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Dong’s eyes also brightened. He swallowed his saliva as he looked at Huo Yuhao. He hadn’t tasted the delicacies that Huo Yuhao could make in a long while..</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Xuan, I recall our teachers mentioning that we can’t start a fire in a place like this, since soul beasts live here.” Huo Yuhao joked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Elder Xuan chuckled. “That’s only the case for you kids. With me here, nothing will happen unless we set the whole forest on fire, so hurry up..”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao laughed and walked in front of a chunk of Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear meat to check its quality.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meat of different qualities had to be grilled using different methods. Huo Yuhao had a natural appreciation for cooking, and a sizeable talent at it..</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some people who made ordinary tasting food even after years of cooking experience, while others had natural talent. Like Huo Yuhao who could use his Spiritual Detection to enhance the quality of cooking this chunk of meat to make it taste better.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Darkgolden Terrorclaw Bear’s meat was entirely dark red and very springy. There were streaks of fat spread proportionally on the surface of it in a webbed pattern, usually meaning that the meat was very fresh.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huo Yuhao retrieved his White Tiger Dagger and cut this chunk of meat, to discover that this chunk of meat came from the bear’s back.</span></p>

He was fine with it as long as it tasted nice.</span></p>
